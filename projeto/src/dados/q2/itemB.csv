a fantastic fusion of art and science .,1
"the light show which occurs for 5 min in the begining of every hour from sunset to 1 am should not be missed.and at 1am , the entire tower lights will be of and only diamond lights will glow for 5 min .",1
been to paris three times .,1
fabulous view on a sunny april day !,1
hard to say where they start & stop .,1
"through security by 10 , and were up the tower by 10:15 .",1
i visited in july and purchased my ticket online in may .,1
we were pleasantly surprised and overcome by the sight to our right as the lovely tower revealed itself !,1
yes join the long live watch your personal things d go the top a twilight .,1
the eiffel tower is a treasure .,1
"take the trip up to the top , book this in advance if you can !",1
who would go to paris with out going on the tower ????,1
i walked the 700 odd steps and went to the second level to absorb the beautiful views from the top .,1
"worthwhile , definitely !",1
we only waited for about 20 -30 minutes before we joined the queue for the lift to the top of the tower .,1
we were staying close so we got to see the light show often .,1
"at 46 , i was finally able to do it .",1
"after ice skating , we climbed up the stairs to the next level and beyond .",1
it was really pretty .,1
"goid visibility , great view and photographs .",1
one must visit this icon to truly experience paris .,1
visited the 2nd floor .,1
"we arrived half an hour before opening time and queue was already ling , so bear this in mind when visiting !",1
i must say i felt quite safe inside this secured area .,1
"an awesome place to be , though i personally have issue with security",1
"but it does get really busy , then you have to push your way into the elevators .",1
you can see it from almost any point in paris but you do n't appreciate the size until you walk toward it .,1
i was in paris a few years ago for a day trip when you could just walk right up and not wait in the long lines .,1
"do n't plan on relaxing views on the lawn as the place , day and night , was swarming with cheap souvenir hawkers .",1
if you time it right you 'll see the tower sparkle on the hour as well .,1
"it is a staggering height at over 300m while not the worlds tallest , it is an amazing structure of engineering .",1
still good to experience,1
i decided to walk around the park on the other side from the seine .,1
"wow such a beautiful landmark , at night it 's just mesmerising all lit up .",1
"it 's not too difficult to walk up the stairs as you can stop and enjoy the view -lrb- i.e. , catch your breath -rrb- while climbing .",1
"due to security issue in paris , there are security check before you and enter the eiffel tower areas .",1
"as well , you can walk up and take the elevator down .",1
"not a good place if you 're claustrophobic , but a must do nonetheless if in paris .",1
stairs are ok for coming down but prepared for a hard slog if you do n't want to crowd into the elevator,1
allow most of the day as waiting is a big part of it .,1
unless loaded with cash $ 18 for a glass of champagne at the summit is a bit rough .,1
"all in all , should definitely check it out .",1
very crowded but space to move & view .,1
the views are truly amazing .,1
"as we turned the corner and i saw some of the eiffel tower 's top , i totally lost my mind .",1
the only downside is the amount of sellers trying to push trinkets on to you at the bottom can be quite intimidating .,1
on balance yes .,1
"we visited on a clear , dry bright day .",1
so much to see and do in paris .,1
go to the top if you dare !,1
bear with the crowds : it 's absolutely worth your time .,1
when you go there .,1
going up the eiffel tower is simply a must do in paris .,1
"very nice place , breathtaking views , even prettier in the evening around 9:30 -10 pm .",1
and dont forget to climb up to enjoy the beauty of the city .,1
"this takes a long time , so make sure you bring snacks .",1
thousands of people in line just to get through security check points to walk around the base .,1
"be aware , but enjoy .",1
be prepared to wait unless you book online .,1
worth the visit .,1
"at least , on the ground floor .",1
"frankly , up close it 's not as impressive as seen from one of the points around paris that put it in perspective .",1
absolutely amazing !!,1
"this has to be a must do , we went up in the lift to the top of the eiffel tower , the view is just amazing",1
"intense security , do n't carry a bottle of soda .",1
"although i 've seen it several times , it never ceases to amaze .",1
get there when it first opens and you will have a pleasant experience .,1
everyone got alone quite well from all races and religions and country of origins.there are some interesting photos that you can review to learn more about the unusual happenings on the tower .,1
she preferred making jokes more than focusing on the tour .,1
we visited again a couple days later to take the lift up .,1
really worth a visit with great views of paris .,1
i was n't sure the best way to visit the eiffel tower .,1
"the wait to get to the top was average , not too long and worth the wait .",1
a fabulous first experience in paris for our children .,1
but views from the other two levels .,1
my wife and i visited levels 1 and 2 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves .,1
eiffel tower was great .,1
it is a must visit and going up the tower is a must .,1
"view from the top is awesome , something worth coming so far !!",1
we queued for about 20 minutes just after 3pm to get to the top .,1
"best view , best vibe !",1
the views were just stunning at each level up the tower and was the perfect setting to celebrate our anniversary .,1
i thought it was going to be average/tourist food but it was very nice !!!!!,1
the views were breathtaking but we were very lucky it was such a sunny day !,1
best view is probably from the trocadero .,1
"had to wait approx 40 mins to get through the queue this was at approx 1pm , was a very cold windy day .",1
standing under the tower makes you feel like you have finally arrived in paris .,1
in the evening the surroundings look different and dazzling .,1
walk it to the platform and then take the lift .,1
but it meant for shorter lines everywhere including at the eiffel tower .,1
it 's a beautiful sight at night .,1
simply put if you are in paris you must see the eiffel tower and get the ticket to the top .,1
jaw dropping,1
it 's higher than it looks also !,1
this was something neither of us had done in past visits because it was closed due to weather .,1
worth waiting just be sure to allow yourself time !,1
each hour the tower 's lights twinkle and it is beautiful .,1
perfect !!!,1
truly breathtaking structure and well worth the effort if you are prepared to wait .,1
the boulevard opposite to the tower is also a good place to take photos .,1
"it was not very busy , no queues , which made the experience even better .",1
...,1
watch for pick pockets .,1
of course a must see .,1
believe the view from the nearby pullman hotel at night is spectacular so if you get a chance pl .,1
"although we could n't get to the top , still you have a direct and perfect view from there .",1
you will still be amazed when you see it in real .,1
i would recommend booking online at least a week in advance of planned visit .,1
you ca n't underestimate the beauty of this site .,1
i realised that the waiting time to get to two ticket machines was going to be about an hour .,1
"we saw it by day , not very impressive however at night it 's amazing .",1
"reserve for lunch at the jules verne , instead .",1
"so , it 's common sense .",1
"worth taking the stairs if you can , it is fun and a good exercise .",1
"what i would advise is get there really early , no later than 9:30 am or you 'll spend a lot of time queuing .",1
"great views , sure .",1
it gets very crowded below the tower and i know it 's been mentioned before but please look after your belongings !,1
"on the way down from the top , the tower lights up and it is simply magical to see the lights turning on as you go down .",1
grab some stuff to have a picnic and sit in the grass or on a bench .,1
der blick hinter die kulissen ist interessant -lrb- mechanik -rrb- .,1
"i think it is a ` must do ' when in paris and if you have good legs , you can walk up the stairs all the way to the top - some 704 steps !",1
"every sensible part of me wanted to skip this , but i am very glad i took the family .",1
try book up way in advance unlike us who tried about 10 days before and was impossible .,1
my husband proposed to me on this and i will never ever forget it .,1
i love the light show when were aboard the boat from the river siene cruise at night .,1
"watch out for pickpockets , they really hang out at all the famous places .",1
not sure how to review a world icon but here goes .,1
it was possible to buy tickets to the summit once we arrivd d but the queues were very long .,1
"the attraction is open until 1am , so if you can get there before 11pm , you can see paris at night all lit up .",1
"but even if you have n't got a reason ... have champagne at the top , it has to be done .",1
"we watched this ` light show ' from a couple different places - once from the trocadero gardens -lrb- just across the river -rrb- and once from the pont de l'alma -lrb- 1km away -rrb- , and thought it was more impressive from the further distance .",1
there are two elevator entrances and two stairway entrances .,1
had n't visited for many years and forgot how impressive it was .,1
i would recommend going at night to see the beauty of the lights across the city .,1
"predictably , it was way to busy and cramped up the top and the view itself was n't exactly jaw-dropping , say compared to the mont blanc or even geneva .",1
so i then looked into tours with third parties and found a `` sunset '' tour with a guide and `` front of the line '' entry .,1
it is a magical place and a wonderful must see sight .,1
watch out for the long line of cheap trinket vendors that harass you all th way there .,1
if it 's your first time in paris you have to go up the eiffel tower .,1
"however , if you are short on time you would not be missing out if you skipped this as there are better views of the city elsewhere - particularly views with the tower in it .",1
as we were taking photos the lights began to blink and the tower broke into a full light show .,1
"magnificent views from the top , and we took the opportunity to walk down from there , rather than taking the elevators .",1
"great dinner at the restaurant , great service and a really fun evening .",1
champagne adds to the beauty .,1
if you want to summit or eat in the tower do yourself a favor and buy skip the line tickets online ahead of your visit .,1
at 10pm starts lights to blink at the tower,1
windy up there !,1
what a wonderful,1
"views are great , the history is interesting , and we highly recommend it as a fun way to familiarize yourself with the layout of beautiful paris .",1
"be careful not to get ripped off with ` beat the queues ' tickets , which can be very costly .",1
watch out for pickpockets on the ground and the top .,1
we went to the tower in october & the weather was kind,1
"in fact , i strongly urge and recommend buying tickets in advance .",1
we waited around 40 minutes at the queue for the stairs and saw the first two levels that way .,1
do the louvre instead .,1
kids enjoyed a lot the attractions on the 1st floor .,1
took my husband for his birthday to see the eiffel tower was amazing as i 've been before and knew he 'd like it .,1
night view is great but a little bit scary .,1
it was unclear first that there are some places where you can go with lift as well .,1
we visited the eiffel tower while in paris .,1
what to say about the eiffel tower that has n't been told or written ?,1
go at night so you can see the city of paris lit up !,1
15 mins .,1
you have to see it during day time and in the evening .,1
get the ticket to go to the summit for a lovely view .,1
i 've been in paris 3 times and everytime i see the eiffel tower i am saying to myself that the closer i get the ugliest it becomes .,1
"every time we return to paris and visit eiffel tower , there is something new to experience .",1
a few people shouting that they got their bags taken .,1
just great !,1
amazing views from this iconic landmark .,1
11 $ for the 2nd story and 17 $ to take the elevator to the summit .,1
thanks wikipedia .,1
"i recommend the night views , especially when the lights flashes .",1
so keep that in mind for timing and whats in your purse .,1
"as it turned out , it was misty ands a bit foggy at the day/time of our reservation .",1
i was wowed .,1
"long lines and lots of waiting , purchase your ticket online ahead of time if at all possible .",1
before it thought it was only a high iron tower .,1
certainly a must when visiting paris .,1
"we bought our tickets , and then had to wait in another line to get on the lift .",1
"the only problem is on the 2nd floor , where all the people meet and there is only one queue to the elevator that takes you to the top of the tower -lrb- if you have the ticket for it -rrb- .",1
from this hight everything looks even .,1
we were n't interested in going up the tower but we loved glimpsing it from multiple places in the city .,1
"my second time to visit eiffel tower , still love it .",1
we headed straight for the top .,1
i guess it 's our last !,1
i think it may be beautiful to visit at night .,1
however many are put off going up when they arrive and see the queues of up to 3 hours .,1
"was there for the french national holiday once and saw fireworks around the eiffeltower as well , also very much worth it .",1
well its the eiffel tower and youre in paris so what more is there to say .,1
love the views from all levels .,1
if you ca n't afford to stay close to eiffel tower i will strongly suggest to get your place in the park in front of eiffel tower -lrb- champs de mars -rrb- by 8 pm on july 14 .,1
its lovely and not overrated at all .,1
a long queue from allover the world is waiting for that moment but it was moving ... when you reach the old left you can touch that feeling that you are going to catch the clouds and you were in the top of the world .,1
thought the exhibits were quite good .,1
"the restaurant above is also good , although a little expensive but that 's what you have to pay for when eat with such an ambience .",1
it is cheaper to purchase the stairs to the 1st and 2nd levels .,1
a must when you 're in paris .,1
"the eiffel tower is one of the most iconic and famous destination of tourists worldwide and i have to say that although it is fantastic , there are much more better places to have a view of paris .",1
do n't bring large bags unless you have two .,1
we got a cycle taxi from the eiffel tower to the champs elysee .,1
that is exactly what we did and it was magical .,1
we were on a ship docked in front of the eiffel tower .,1
my children loved it .,1
we missed out on this .,1
"it was a nice break from all-adult , all the time exploration .",1
"or people avoiding due to the football , but i would n't be put off going to the tower because of the football .",1
make a reservation so you do n't have to wait in long lines .,1
in spite of the fact that 3 out of 4 ties the top had been shrouded in cloud they have loved it .,1
"we arrived at the tower but the queues were so long , perhaps because of the floods closing some other venues it would have taken hours to get in so wasting the day .",1
"if you do n't mind tourists , then you 'll love it .",1
i did not went up because there were long lines and i would rather spend the money on something less crowded .,1
"currently there is some construction happening on the champ de mars , but still a good place for wonderful views of the tower .",1
go to the top of the hyatt regency for a spectacular view at night when the tower sparkles on the hour .,1
"i was surprised to learn the tower is actually a light tan , latte color .",1
waiting time is not that much 15 to 20 minutes given also the security measures currently in place .,1
great views of paris are obtained from these restaurants too .,1
"eiffel tower probably is the world 's greatest collection of impressionist art , housed in an architectural gem .",1
"you have limited time , go see somewhere else instead .",1
"the light show at night is spectacular and very romantic , a must see during any stay .",1
a must visit when in paris if there are no long lines .,1
"if you go to paris , you will see the eiffel tower from everywhere ... but you do n't really get a feeling for it until you visit .",1
paris is such a lovely city and the top of the eiffel tower is a great place to to appreciate its layout and beauty .,1
we purchased tickets online ahead of time which saved time from us having to queue .,1
it 's fun to be up that high but the best view is really from the second level .,1
and requesting you sign a petition -lrb- or something ! -rrb-,1
a magical sight .,1
such a disappointment .,1
go to the very top for the best views .,1
first time we visited we did n't realise there was the place de concord at the back with some lovely wee cafes to sit in and people watch .,1
spent 4 hours here as there is quite a lot to see and do .,1
but beautiful views !,1
"the lines can be long depending the time of the year that you go , but it is worth the wait .",1
no paris trip is complete without a trip to eiffel !,1
one of the best spot is on pont iena which is across from the et ... you can get a much better view of the entire tower than when you are close to it .,1
chose the stairs to the elevator .,1
do not go to the third floor if heights bother you .,1
went to the tower during the day 03/03/2016 .,1
we timed it so that we got to the second deck shortly before sunset and we really liked that choice .,1
there were around 669 steps to go up but not really hard to finish .,1
"we also took a tour of the underground hydraulic system thru viator , and it gave us a look of the underground basements bunkers of the eiffel , the tour also gave us access to the upper floors and to the very top .",1
-lrb- which you can from almost everywhere in the city ! -rrb-,1
we however returned later in the evening and managed to gain access to the top level which had been reopened !,1
"i did n't expect to see a mannequin type display at the top , but was interested to know that gustov eiffel , built an apartment at the top and hosted gatherings for various vip 's .",1
"well , many years later there 's tight tight security .",1
people should visit it at least once in their lifes !,1
you can walk around that level and then go up to the tip top .,1
when i was in front of the tower i was speechless it was like to be in a movie when i was at the top i felt really good do n't miss it,1
it 's very curious how you think that the tower is n't so big but when you get closer you just got amazed with the size and all the architeture envolved in it .,1
well worth a tour guide to get history .,1
"it was crowded and the lines were long so we decided not to go up , but the view from ground level was magnificent anyway .",1
the view from top is beyond word to explain .,1
definitely should pre-book as lines are horrible .,1
"if you are lucky , it would be sun setting behind you .",1
nice to say we 've done it but it is overrated .,1
at awe ... must go and experience the tower at night too !,1
we took lots of photos for every angle and it is perfect and beautiful .,1
"visiting eiffel tower is pointless if you 're not gon na summit , view from the summit is breathtaking .",1
decided to walk down from level 2 to level 1 - omg it is a long way .,1
the view from the top is good though .,1
well worth visiting but prepurchase your ticket well in advance or risk not getting a ticket at all .,1
"but try and be there early -lrb- and not during peak season , if at all possible -rrb- .",1
nice quality -lrb- food -rrb- it a bit pricey -lrb- in the better restaurant from the two of three i think -rrb-,1
the cruise boats are tiny when you look down at them .,1
"you have also an indoor part , which i found it very 80 's .",1
recommend booking this tour through viator - sienne river cruise with trip to eiffel tower,1
"be prepared to wait on line , get pushed a bit and for heavens sake , watch your pockets from the gypsies that roam around but you have to come here and soak it in .",1
"you just ca n't visit paris without visiting the eiffel tower but be prepared for long , long queues for tickets , for lifts up and lifts down .",1
the eiffel tower is easy to get to from the metro or by bus .,1
still worth the wait even to get part of the way up,1
"by day , depending on the light , it is black and ugly and unremarkable .",1
the other elevator was working but the line was very long .,1
the magnificent view of the city from the top is not to be missed .,1
"both are monumental , magnificent structures , and paris icons .",1
"we had dinner upstairs , so we did not have to get on a long line to get in the elevator to go up .",1
it might get busy with the elevator sometimes but i do n't recommend taking kids when its busy because of the queue for the elevator .,1
i took screen shots of the tickets -lrb- the bar code us the bit they want -rrb- i did this 2 days before we got to the eiffel tower .,1
romantic and impressive .,1
lovely place !,1
the walk up is exhausting if you 're unfit but there is a nice resting place on the 1st floor .,1
otherwise i would have to say that it was a good visit and excellent value for money .,1
it 's such a unique and magnificent place .,1
on the negative side there are a lot of street sellers who do not like taking no for an answer .,1
i had a really great time there .,1
does what it says on tin .,1
second floor has a great view .,1
i 'd always thought it was black !!!,1
one can not possibly rate this landmark any less !,1
we also walked through a little market place .,1
the eiffel tower was number 1 on my list of things to see in paris .,1
everything must have been said and written about this beautiful place but it is all true .,1
but i got the ticket to the mid level -lrb- which is still very high -rrb- ... i did n't stand in the line and the line was loooooongggggg ... .,1
a must on the tourist guide to paris but really other than the amazing views this is not the best place to visit .,1
"can get very crowded , so go early or late !",1
i could ' t go up as i am to afraid of heights but even being near it was just spectacular .,1
the eiffel tower is just as amazing in person .,1
long queues though so book a time slot before you go .,1
"it is very well organised , very security conscious -lrb- good to know at the moment -rrb- and we thoroughly enjoyed it .",1
i recommend to do eiffla tour in the morning to avoide a long time in queue !,1
reserve before you go to insure you get the day/time you want .,1
"if you 've ever been to disney world , you have trained yourself to stand in line at the tower .",1
we arrived early to beat the queues and we passed through security very easily and the security staff were very helpful -lrb- we were travelling with a stroller -rrb- .,1
i went up the tower 2 days ago .,1
beautiful and as well as romantic !,1
the tour took us to the basement and even behind the hydraulic lift to show some of the original engineer innovations .,1
reached the top of the tower and the views there were out of this world .,1
sooooo beautiful at night .,1
do n't miss it as it is a beautiful sight to behold !,1
the architecture is a feat to behold and the meaning of the tower and why it 's there is also unique .,1
i was disappointed by how much of a let down the experience was .,1
not as crowded as expected on a monday evening and we 'll worth the wait .,1
"it also lights up nicely at night , every hour on the hour it has a glitter effect",1
"first you climb tons of stairs , definitely over 100 to get to the first observation deck , which is wide , lots of room and you get fantastic city views .",1
one must be aware that it takes two to three hours to get to the top through lifts as the queues are long and tickets heavy .,1
of course you 're going to go to the eiffel tower .,1
would n't have seen them if we took the elevator .,1
we 've been to the foot of the tower before - never bothered to go up till this time -- just went to the first dock - was amazing !,1
so crowded it was not at all enjoyable .,1
i have been here before so we decided to visit at night .,1
because we had a drizzle day there was barely any line which was great .,1
did you know about the restaurant ?,1
we went up to the second level and wow what views of paris .,1
i loved the lift ride to level 2 of the eiffel tower with our `` jump the queue pass '' & the view was rewarding .,1
there is a lot of work currently being done in the trocadero area so it is n't as nice to hang out here as it has been in the past .,1
excellent system of security if not a little sad given the circumstances .,1
this is the ultimate destination to visit for honeymoon and for us this was the first place we visited for our honeymoon in paris .,1
we have seen night view also of the same from boat .,1
"i ca n't say i was a fan of the 2 hour wait to get on the elevator and the 45 minute wait to get back down , but the view made up fo it .",1
"it 's overpriced of course , but this is a special moment !",1
defiantly take the lift .,1
"during the day we went to the restaurant , which had great food .",1
to see -lrb- and touch -rrb- the iconic structural wonder was an experience worth its weight in gol -lrb- iron :-rrb- .,1
but the view is prettier from the bottom .,1
"we did walk down which was n't so bad since it was going down , not up .",1
if you travel durning the peak summer days a reservation may be the answer to early board rather then the long lines .,1
the firework display was better than any i have ever seen - or heard of .,1
"myself and my partner did not wo n't to queue for hours as we wanted to make the most of our trip to paris so we made the booking with viator , the guide was so lovely and helpful .",1
oh well .,1
you should go in up to the 2nd and 3rd floor .,1
its a do or die if you hate heights .,1
maybe they should have a word with disneyland .,1
the view of the tower from the bateaux mouches is very good too .,1
i actually want to try walking the stairs to the top,1
standing underneath is a must .,1
its tall beautiful and made of thousands of tons of steel .,1
get there early to beat the crowds .,1
"fyi , security took our water bottles .",1
watch the sunset from tracodero towards the eiffel tower .,1
it 's wonderful !,1
thank fully they could n't !!,1
the queue are long and slow .,1
but it all the hard work pays when you catch the breath taking view from top of the eiffel tower .,1
it will make your experience much better !,1
completely shock when i arrived totally dream stay in europe enjoy the skyline feel free with my friends,1
"also , you must visit during the day and the evening , preferably get there around 9:30 pm , at 10:00 pm there is a music and twinkle light show that is super cool , you wo n't want to miss it !",1
"it was pricy to go to the top , but it was well worth the price .",1
"i personally wanted to eat at the restaurant , but the other people in my party did not want to .",1
"eiffel tower at night is just marvelous , especially when it is less crowded .",1
was surprised at how cheap all the attractions in paris are compared to other european cities .,1
highly recommended for all .,1
eiffel tower is at its best at sundawn .,1
we only went to the second floor of the tower as i 'm not overly good with heights but it was an experience that you should do in paris .,1
"it goes without saying , that you simply would not want to go to paris and not visit its most iconic edifice .",1
"only negative are the beggars trying to get you to sign things for various fake charities -lrb- i assume a pickpocket strategy -rrb- , and the bizarre cheap rip off goods being sold by everyone underneath .",1
the lift ride up is an experience in itself and the views from the top are stunning .,1
we made advance reservations so the line was short and quick .,1
we were nervous about making the 688 step climb in the dark but decided that we had to go for it .,1
"if you are visiting paris for the first time , the eiffel tower should not be missed .",1
the weather was not so good .,1
"we wanted to visit the summit , but unfortunately it was closed .",1
"we booked the paris must see tour , eiffel tower lunch & versailles castle tour with concergerie.com along with other tours prior to leaving australia .",1
"people go to the tower to share a bottle of wine and watch the lights , a great thing to do .",1
would definitely do this process again .,1
"bit disorganised here but not too bad , took about 15 minutes of waiting before getting into a lift and part of that time was spent looking for the ticket machine .",1
security staff as well helpful .,1
the eiffel tower provides an extraordinary view of sprawling paris .,1
"also went at night to take photos of the tower only , on the hour it lights up like fireworks , very spectacular show to watch .",1
unfortunately the top level was closed for work at the time .,1
i suppose it is a must see if coming to paris .,1
we went all the way to the summit .,1
great views across the city and it is quite spacious up there with a few small shops .,1
being there absolutely feels like top of the world .,1
in the middle there is a ski ring .,1
the tower is only a short walk from the metro stop and this attraction is a must see while in paris .,1
bravo !!!,1
there are gift shops and a bar on second floor .,1
i went with my husband and enjoyed a lot .,1
the only available spot was at 10 pm so book as early as possible .,1
its a bit of a walk to reach it but very worth it so it is a must to see .,1
✔ .,1
if you 're fit enough you can climb the first two platforms by stair and still get your ticket for the escalator up to the top platform .,1
"i must have taken over 30 photos , viewing the tower from every angle and still finding interesting and compelling compositions .",1
it really is a fun experience and not just a ` view ' of paris - though that of course is cool .,1
would recommend provoking tickets,1
"i do n't know what it is about this tower , but i love it !",1
i was given several dirty looks when i accidently joined a queue because a group had n't moved up .,1
i would recommend for everyone to visit the eiffel tower at least once .,1
you have to do this .,1
"then the tower lights went on : search lights to the horizon , and sparkling strobes from top to bottom .",1
after waiting for more than 2 hours in a serpentine queue we made it to the top level of the tower .,1
champagne bar and all !,1
the queues can be long but we were lucky the day we went and we were less than an hour in line .,1
"it 's a tacky touristy thing to do , but you just must do it once .",1
eiffel tower is most certainly one of the most romantic spots on earth !,1
probably different appreciation by francophiles .,1
"beautiful , wow , wow ,",1
it is painted a bland beige color .,1
also went to the top to catch the awesome city views !,1
"being out of school holiday times the queues were not too long and did move very efficiently and quickly , there was a continuous stream of people but the lifts were well organised .",1
it 's breathtaking any time of day or night .,1
the sun did not come down until 10 pm so we also ended up enjoying our view of eiffel tower at night with lights up when we came back from the cruise .,1
going up the eiffel tower is a must when visiting paris .,1
"if you have children with you , be warned there are very overpriced disney toys in the shop that have nothing to do with the eiffel tower itself so you may not want your child to see them .",1
"if you can , walk up as it will help you appreciate the incredible structure but as the lift has glass sides , it still allows you to appreciate the ascent .",1
"at first i was disappointed we could only get to the second level -lrb- top was sold out -rrb- , but in the end , it was perfect .",1
you get a picturesque view of paris and champs élysées et al you can view to your hearts content .,1
we skipped the line and walked to the tower with a tour guide with audio headset .,1
the streets were so filthy .,1
"we were disappointed about this news until we visited this time and found the tower surrounded by chain link fencing and the ubiquitous metal detector , with the champ du mars , one of our favorite picnic spots in the shadow of the tower , similarly fenced .",1
you will stand in line no matter what the ticket sales say .,1
i suggest you do this on a warm day since in april we were so cold that high up .,1
"but it was a bit of a letdown , not so much so the tower 's fault but rather the fact that the entire surrounding area is not quite what i would have envisioned .",1
it was a mistake to go inside .,1
skip the line is very nice and saved a lot of time great views and a must do experience .,1
i 've seen pictures but nothing compares to the views in person and what you experience at night .,1
"it was raining and during the week , so not as crowded as i was told .",1
a beautiful view of paris city,1
the tour included the scene river cruise as well,1
well worth a visit while in paris .,1
we visited on a sunday evening .,1
most of your time spent here will be waiting in line and get ready to be crammed like sardines in the elevator .,1
"i stood in the middle of the elevator , which moves quickly and stand back away from the edge and you will be okay .",1
the eiffel tower is magnificent at night .,1
otherwise there is also a cafe and a couple of gift shops .,1
"hell yeah , it was a life time experience to visit such a world known attraction .",1
the elevator line was 2 hours long !,1
unfortunately during the holidays the amount of people was stunning .,1
there are fewer crowds and there is free ice skating on the first level .,1
every floor is beautiful in its own way and not just the summit -lrb- top floor -rrb- .,1
"every trip , i make sure to visit just because it always looks a bit different ... lighting , time of day , and surrounding settings of the season .",1
"3 -rrb- successful companies find solutions , not conflict .",1
"many only go to the 2nd floor , and once there you ca n't upgrade to a `` summit '' ticket .",1
they did not -lrb- which i understand -rrb- but they were very rude about it .,1
the lights flash every hour and is awesome .,1
wrap up warm .,1
but at night the tower lights up and every hour twinkles for 5 minutes .,1
absolutely incredible experience and a must for anyone visiting paris !,1
you can not miss that !,1
unfortunately we did not plan ahead and by thus we did not book tickets in advance .,1
"let us be honest : taking a lift all the way up was a must do for the kids , but not worth the two hour queue",1
"as recommended by others , we got our tickets on-line about a month before visiting .",1
"we entered from the southern end where the park is , no lines .",1
"i never did see the eiffel tower lit up at night though , so an overnight layover gave me a wonderful opportunity to see this world famous landmark in a whole different light .",1
it was bitter sweet to go back because seeing my beloved eiffel tower surrounded by a fence and guards with dogs was very sad .,1
"we thought we could do this in paris once we got an idea of what our trip would be like , but you need more time -- possibly a few weeks out .",1
"we spent a total of 4 hours with getting in , the tour , wondering around , looking at the paris skyline trying to find landmarks , and then going to the summit for champagne and sunset .",1
be aware the lines to access the elevator to the top are very long but well worth the wait .,1
"but you do n't really need to pay to go up to the top , the best way to see it is walking around it and admiring the architecture .",1
value for money .,1
this is my favourite place in the whole world ... i 've been with my man and i 've also travelled on my own when he has been unable to attend ... .,1
the added information was excellent .,1
excellent ... .,1
then see it at night when it twinkles !!,1
security checks now to get under tower .,1
a one time visit is more than enough,1
it 's an absolute must for paris .,1
"one of the finest places visited , have to try on both day & night time .",1
there is now security detail in place to get in and that was not there in 2010 .,1
it was drizzling and very very windy !,1
the queue is quick and it takes 15-20 minutes if you go slow to reach the first level .,1
i had purchased timed entry tickets online ahead of time on the official site of the eiffel tower which saved us some time .,1
do n't miss it as it only lasts for maybe 10 minutes .,1
the guide pretended to be a air pilot taking us back in time to the 30 's .,1
"although it was still cloudy on spring , river was overloaded but it never stops us to enjoy the real paris .",1
but in front of me and they trying me make me not comfortable and feel want go out from there .,1
"after seeing pictures of the eiffel tower my entire life , i was still amazed by it when i saw it in person .",1
we saw some youth who had just walked all the way up from the ground they looked cooked .,1
even better than carcassonne though not as warm .,1
phenomenal views and champagne await you ...,1
"we arrived right on time for admittance , and had almost no line to wait for the elevator .",1
unfortunately the food q was large so we had to settle for some nougat and lollies from the gift shop as we were all starving .,1
"when i arrived at the base of the tower , there was an 2 hour line to catch the lift !!",1
we booked a tour with viator - there was no availability to book directly at the eiffel tower website .,1
go in june !,1
"it is not that the eiffel tower experience is a bad one , it is just that i think it could be so much more -lrb- and perhaps my great experience from a previous visit ruined this one for me -rrb- .",1
"in other words , i 'm a bit obese .",1
the ride on the elevator is worth the trip .,1
"from there , it was not easy to decipher exactly which line to go to but on our vouchers , i believe it said to go to a certain colored flag and that really helped .",1
you and the teen -lrb- s -rrb- will not be disappointed .,1
however irrespective getting the elevator to the top was a loooooooonnnnggggg wait !,1
the history of this landmark was by far one of our best tours !!!,1
amazing views but was surprised by the amount of petty crime .,1
eiffel tower is really an iconic monument .,1
make sure you purchase your tickets before you travel that way you can jump the queues .,1
"in short paris is over run by pickpocket gangs and overpriced brasseries 47 euros for breakfast in brasserie next to madeleine metro mugged on first day by roma gypsies at the bottom of eiffel tower pestered non stop by other con artists ie the dropped ring trick , street sellers trying to sell you various rubbish outside all major attractions .",1
and had glittering views of its lighting .,1
"we spent many evenings having wine at the small little park just to the north of the base , in our own little known hideaway .",1
"you should certainly buy your ticket online , if you want to climb .",1
do n't worry about the peddlers .,1
it was cool to see the tower in person after seeing it in pictures for all these years .,1
"we simply walked up to line , bought tickets and ascended .",1
"if you do n't , you should expect to queue for a minimum of 2-3 hours to get onto the tower and then you 'll still be queuing for lifts on top of that .",1
it 's especially beautiful and romantic when it 's lit up at night .,1
go early !,1
a lot of fun but very crowded and a bit disordered .,1
"at first it was just an unattractive tower of metal , but it had some effect on me as i walked around and below it .",1
its one of the most epic landmarks of paris .,1
highly recommend !,1
you can book the ticket in advance if you dont want to stand in the queue .,1
"i could have got the lift down , but as it was n't a particularly long way down , i decided to walk down the eiffel tower using the stairs after i had finished my meal at the restaurant .",1
"take time to appreciate the architecture when you are on the ground , walk around the perimeter outside the footprint to get different views .",1
smaller than anticipated .,1
i never feel like i 've actually been in paris without a visit to eiffel tower .,1
one of the best meals my wife and i had .,1
i was able to walk there for a short visit at some point each day .,1
outstanding view !,1
"while it 's beautiful as an engineering feat during the day , it 's a beyond beautiful and elegant structure at night !",1
i have always wanted to visit the eiffiel tower and it 's the main reason i went to paris .,1
even the ceilings are beautifully done .,1
"its hard to go to paris and not see the eiffel tower , it is a beautiful example of steel architecture .",1
there is a cute little ice skating rink on the first deck and other quicker/cheaper places to get a bite to eat .,1
the crowd was huge and there was a long line to get up .,1
"get there early to avoid lines , the view of 3th floor is very unique , you can see the whole paris .",1
we did n't go up as we wanted to view the actual tower rather than see the view from the tower but it looked fairly well priced $ 11 to take the stairs or $ 16 to take the lift up -lrb- i think -rrb- .,1
a visit to paris is never complete without a visit to the eiffel tower and i visit the lady everytime i visit paris .,1
seeing it at night was magical !,1
children under 10 are free in winter however the summit may be closed .,1
it was made from iron for the 1889 world fair .,1
but am telling you now that you will 99.9999 % for sure regret if you did n't .,1
must see,1
"buy a fast pass , and skip the line .",1
extra police and military providing security .,1
there is love in the air for sure .,1
they 're so persistent the french authorities need to round these illegal immigrants up deport them .,1
you can go up on the stairs or on the elevator .,1
"people selling touristy souvenirs , people putting on impromptu shows , just be careful they will ask for money in return .",1
we took the elevators to the top of the tower .,1
a box ticked .,1
has to be seen whilst in paris but there a load more impressive gorgious venues to view and visit .,1
the views are amazing and having a glass of champagne on first level !!,1
you 're in paris !!,1
we went straight to the lifts .,1
if you can try and book your ticket online before you go .,1
"i do n't understand people who wish to get on the top of the eiffel and loose their nerves at the queue , but it 's their way of enjoying paris .",1
my husband and i took the steps .,1
a definate must while in paris .,1
haha .,1
you can see everything from above .,1
visited the eiffel tower on new years day with my partner - the queues for the tickets were unbelievable -lrb- think we waited just over two hours in the fresh winter sun to get our tickets to the very top -rrb- .,1
my daughter -lrb- 13 -rrb- and i visited the eiffel tower at night last year and had a tremendous time .,1
if you can book ahead but you need to do so months in advance .,1
a stunning view by the evening .,1
i loved every moment .,1
oh and it can get very windy up there so dress appropriately .,1
i hope to return and see it at night .,1
tower is more beautiful from the outside than inside .,1
we got there for 8 -lrb- it opened at 9.30 -rrb- .,1
there is also a security check point to go through that gets very busy so go early if you can .,1
"we tentatively pre-booked our timed guided tour around the eiffel tower before our trip over the internet , and we were not disappointed .",1
i think it 's better to get off at trocadero for better views of the tower rather than right outside it .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see both during the day and at night .,1
once at the top there is a champagne bar for you to celebrate the moment !,1
last visited 15 years ago and you could walk right beneath it and feel ` part ' of it .,1
it 's also ok as you are enclosed while at the top so it 's not too scary .,1
first time visitors may want to spend the bucks to go up .,1
"as you go up , look outside and appreciate how beautiful the city of paris is .",1
"it is full of tourist , the lines are long , the tickets are n't cheap to climb the top but the view from the top is out of this world .",1
"you can still wait in line for tickets there , nominal price , but the lines are horrendous !",1
plus a trip to paris without a visit to the eiffel tower is not really a visit at all - there is a magnetic quality to it as it dominates the paris skyline .,1
very little wait time for entry or elevators .,1
i said yes to the man that i love,1
so many people are there to take photos and to take it all in .,1
there was about 10 seats in the cafe on the 1st floor .,1
long waits .,1
"visibility was good , and we got some really nice photos .",1
we reserved 2 weeks before our visit and get a ticket only for the 2nd level and only for night entrance .,1
17 euros included skip the line and elevator to the summit .,1
do n't miss the first level glass floor .,1
"there are some shops on the 2nd floor , they can be rather expensive .",1
"i would skip the dinner cruise next time because we were so busy eating -lrb- and the music was way too loud -rrb- , that we did n't really get the full effect of all the lights as we traveled the seine .",1
"there 's quite a nice view at the top , but remember , night is when to go .",1
worth the small queues and waits in sept .,1
"of course you need to go here but half an our is plenty to soak up the tower , then head on to more impressive things .",1
"it was our tenth wedding anniversary , the weather was perfect -lrb- blue sky , sunny and around 30 degrees -rrb- and although we had to queue for two hours it was well worth the wait and we chatted to people in the queue which helped pass some time .",1
"fyi , you can not walk through with wine , glass or metal cans but you can go around behind to the lawn to picnic and see the tower .",1
this is absolutely a must-see if you 're in paris as it 's one of the most iconic structures in the world .,1
"we 've seen it on television often but when you see it in person , it certainly takes your breath away .",1
"the views are wonderful , particularly on a sunny day like we had .",1
i would recommend going to the summit when in paris .,1
imposing .,1
"if you decide to take the stairs ~ be prepared , it 's a long way up !!",1
if you have just a short time i would suggest you go in the night when it 's all lit and dazzling .,1
avoid them .,1
i bought the ticket and went up the elevator .,1
holy cow !!,1
this was one of my many highlights of my paris stay .,1
you can see how the top of the tower sways by focusing on a point on the ground but it is quite safe .,1
beware of the amount of street vendors that can be very in your face .,1
the tower was in its sparkle time and was amazing at night .,1
the place get overly packed by the time fireworks start and it will be almost impossible to get a decent spot .,1
"instead , we went back down to the first level to see if we could eat in the restaurant since we had n't eaten all day , and even though we did n't have a reservation , they were able to seat us .",1
"we had two 17 euro tickets to go right to the top , but having seen how ill i had become , my wife thought it best to get a refund .",1
"actually , the view from the montparnasse tower offers a better view of the city .",1
travelers are not allowed to carry water bottle .,1
"so , before proceeding keep water bottles and other food in the hotel room itself .",1
there are two tiers and the fee charged for each tier is different .,1
this is great monument and you can go upto 3 levels .,1
just a couple of suggestions/observations .,1
you should surely not miss it .,1
"plan to take lots of pictures , once dark there is a great light show on the hour , also plan for panoramic pictures from the upper decks if your camera allows .",1
a lot of them are young women who wok in pairs .,1
it 's really an awe inspiring intimidatingly large engineering feat .,1
"the second level is the jules verne restaurant , a great view especially at night in the city lights .",1
first you have the access till second level n then from there to third level which is a must visit .,1
the crowd was very very pushy though .,1
wife and i booked tickets to the top at night on 1/3/16 several months prior .,1
the view from the top is simply breath taking .,1
best to buy souvenirs when you are back down as upstairs can be expensive .,1
it is so beautiful to see during the day and at night all lit up and sparkling is quite a sight !,1
"although it 's a major tourist attraction and usually very crowded , the eiffel tower is another must see in paris .",1
it was skip the line entrance -lrb- totally worth it -rrb- we got there at 5 pm and it was a perfect timing .,1
"the hourly light show was beautiful , the nighttime views from the tower were gorgeous .",1
as i live in paris i did not visit the eiffel tower .,1
so i decided to visit it at around 9:50 pm -lrb- though i did see it through the metro during the day -rrb- .,1
try to go up the tower at night as the night view is stunning .,1
we forgot that the metro closed at midnight -lrb- or before ? -rrb-,1
it is such an architectural masterpiece .,1
"metro station bir hakim is just few meters away , but while approaching eiffel tower , you will come across many crooks trying to squeeze money out of tourists .",1
both at day time and in the night a nice place to be .,1
"be prepared to queue if you want to go up the tower , its longer if you use the lift , but it looked a lot of stairs , we did not have the time to wait but enjoyed seeing it and sitting in the grounds .",1
very nice to watch this at night !,1
we loved the twinkling on the hour .,1
turning the corner and seeing it pierce the sky with all its majesty is truly amazing .,1
tips for eating out - restaurants near by are really expensive .,1
"when dark , before midnight - upon the hour , each hour , the tower flickers with flashing lights .",1
i do n't know if we got lucky ... but we went on a sunday afternoon at 3pm and there were no lines .,1
"we had a one day layover in paris and we , having little interest in art , decided to skip the louvre and all the art exebitions and headed straight to the eiffel tower via the rer train .",1
i love the eiffel tower from a distance or up close ; actually prefer it from a distance .,1
"much later in the evening , we viewed from the steps at rocadero - superb !!",1
got our tickets in advance and went to the top .,1
one word of warning .,1
and yea i did really feel excited that i 've made a chance of my life by seeing the tower through my eyes in real .,1
it 's one of the most land mark around the world it 's famous enough to visit it have a three level and a garden around it it 's amazing view for paris .,1
i am petrified of heights but was determined to give it a go .,1
the only thing was that it was so crowded .,1
me and my family went there and we were so excited to be at `` the '' eiffel tower .,1
the eiffel tower -lrb- french : la tour eiffel -rrb- is one of the famous symbols of paris .,1
and you need to be there to believe it .,1
on our way back to our hotel we were stoked to have hopped into a taxi which driver speaked english spanish and french so that was awesome to get tips to navigate around town and make the best out of our stay -lrb- :,1
the iconic eiffel tower .,1
book well in advance as the ticket lines are very long or do a tour group as they get preference .,1
really enjoyed this experience .,1
eiffel tower is a world famous landmark and the ultimate symbol of paris .,1
lives upto its reputation .,1
sunset was due at 8pm .,1
they also light it up on the hour with blue lights which is great to experience .,1
seeing it at night is the best !,1
"this is amazing to see , 1st floor 2nd floor and sommet .",1
do n't think i would return .,1
awesome seen from the river cruise at a distance .,1
we wanted to actually go inside the eiffel tower and see the sunset from the top .,1
"i saw the same woman , day after day , with the same sad story collecting from well meaning tourists .",1
"the details of how it is constructed , every rod and rivet , become super interesting up close .",1
"also on this floor is a small cafeteria selling snacks and sandwiches and the main formal restaurant , which charges around a 100 euros + per person for dinner .",1
after ten pm it has light show which looks like a thousand stars twinkling all over it ... good photo opportunity .,1
this is the best way to get up the tower without waiting because you have a scheduled lift time .,1
lucky me !,1
"i know that to many people -lrb- especially when she was built -rrb- this may be an unattractive tower -lrb- landmark -rrb- , but to me , for some reason , this is one of the most beautiful and iconic landmarks in the world .",1
also must take the ride to the top and the view of paris lit up during the evening is stunning .,1
"we did the combo eiffel tower , louvre and notre dame .",1
"very nice trip but we could have done with booking on line , the weather was perfect to many people queuing for tickets that can take up to 2 hours",1
great view from above and is excellent .,1
they no longer sell tickets from stage 1 to stage 2 .,1
we stayed at a hotel just down the street from this on a recent visit and tow alk outside and see this beauty every day ... and night from our window was inspiring ... although not a great are to stay in,1
we rode the elevator to the top .,1
"in the heart of paris , one of the most well known landmarks in the world , a definite must see when here .",1
"we were here on a very rainy and foggy , so visibility was extremely limited , but there is nothing like the feeling of being at one of the world 's most well-known tourist sights .",1
be sure to get your tickets ahead of time so that you can get in the short line .,1
any words would not do this iconic structure justice .,1
the view was amazing from the top .,1
"if you choose not to , you will be stuck in the line forever and it is really crowded by the entrance .",1
we waited too long to get tickets online to the summit so we had to book a tour to get summit tickets .,1
we queued for approximately 3 hours to get into the eiffel tower because of security checks etc -lrb- for which we were thankful - better safe than sorry -rrb- but the wonderful views were worth it .,1
"by the time we reached the top the temperature had dropped considerably and so it was a shame that we could n't stay up there much longer than we did , our fault for visiting in february !!",1
it 's so big and so wonderful .,1
we were staying at disneyland paris and caught the train into paris for the day to show our daughter -lrb- 7yrs -rrb- some of the key sights .,1
the eiffel tower is an experience you must have in france .,1
"always worth visit , even to marvel from the ground at its stature .",1
"it is no fun with you and 100,000 of your closest friends .",1
worth the price you pay to go up .,1
"yes , it 's only a metal structure , yet , there 's something about it that is so grand and beautiful .",1
stunning views !!!,1
we had made reservations and bought tickets before we left home - a couple of months in advance .,1
"i know it sounds gushy , but i got chills looking at it from below .",1
we had lunch at the restaurant on the 4th floor and basically took many pictures to record our visit after .,1
"kind of pricey to go to the top , i think it was 20e but you have to do it for the view and history .",1
ideally go up it during the week on a clear day .,1
it is a remarkable structure !,1
"it 's like a wonder of the world , this large imposing structure that you can walk amongst its frame .",1
the tower was a lot taller than i always thought it was .,1
must see this at night .,1
soaking in the scenes as i approached the eiffel tower for the first time .,1
"it was impressive , our first time .",1
there is an excellent official website for purchasing advance tickets before you get to paris .,1
"it 's an amazing experience , especially at night with the view of the city .",1
was a great place to see in paris as it 's the first thing that comes to mind when people say `` france '' .,1
the view is the same from up there but we just walked up because we had time before meeting for our next stopover .,1
we got there fairly early but still had to wait in line a while to get through security .,1
do your bookings much in advance for the top viewing at highest floor .,1
there are lines on both sides and one attendant suggested we go to the other side as it is typically less crowded .,1
the reservation allows you to by-pass the long security line for a much shorter one .,1
"this way , we were able to take daylight pictures , watch the sunset over the city , and then stay for night pictures as well .",1
this was one of those unforgettable moments in one 's life .,1
"be ready for a lot of people , especially if you go in summer .",1
there was also a playground for the kids nearby where they played for an hour .,1
"to some people it might be frightening , but we felt safe .",1
"in the most beautiful cities i have ever been , and i have seen many .",1
we waited an hour to get up to the stairs then we waited another 25 minutes to take the elevator to the summit .,1
visited here 9 times and each time is still magical !,1
"paris is a place to visit at least once in a lifetime , if i had a chance ill live over there .",1
the clear floor level was great though .,1
i did n't want to go back down !,1
impressive views of paris from the top .,1
there are great shops and a nice restaurant .,1
you can see it from many arrondissements throughout paris .,1
the beautiful lawns on which one could picnic in the past was barricaded to form a fan park .,1
some go from the eiffel tower and you get amazing views and it 's much more romantic and fun .,1
ps : beware of pick pocketer under around the these areas !!!,1
buy tickets in advance to avoid even longer lines .,1
i do not recommend buying the reserve tickets since you lose all your flexibility in trying to plan your visit around the weather .,1
the time required to wait is completely worth it after reaching the top !!,1
you should not miss that .,1
sky was clear .,1
how can one visit paris without seeing this magnificent structure ???,1
we were prepared for cold and wind .,1
a lot of street vendors around the tower but they do eventually stop hassling you .,1
you would n't want to miss going up the tour for anything if you 're in paris .,1
we visited during an unseasonably chilly last week of april 2016 .,1
with a reason the main attraction of paris .,1
memorable .,1
beautiful view of paris .,1
"do n't miss that , by any means , but i 'm not sure it 's worth it to climb the tower .",1
"took the elevator to the first viewing area which is a good distance up and it was stunning to see all around paris , the city of light !",1
a great day !,1
on our first evening we decided on a romantic walk to get our bearings .,1
we visited in april so it was a cool night .,1
"this queue took a little longer - a good 30 minutes , and it was very windy !",1
we came at night when paris is lit up .,1
"anyone who says the eiffel tower is overrated , is insane .",1
beautiful and if you 're in paris this is a must see .,1
"unfortunately due to bad weather conditions we werent able to go to the top , but also the 2nd floor whas wourth the visit .",1
but the eiffel tower is a sight not to be missed when visiting paris .,1
"for the price its excellent value , but i do recommend taking the stairs if your feeling it up to it .",1
"she left after a good 7 minutes , we carried on eating and then our hot main dish was brought over and left on the side goin cold whilst we ate our starter !!??",1
there are ways to buy your way to faster entry like on line or through viator trips .,1
"up close , it looks rusty and metallic .",1
"may seem like a touristy thing , but to me it 's absolutely magical !",1
"so spectacular , so beautiful , so amazingly built ... love the eiffel tower .",1
we took the lift to the top but climbed the stairs down which gave us the opportunity to see the impressive steel work up close and enjoy the view at our own pace .,1
make sure u come early in the morning to queue in order to go to sommet .,1
"there are n't too many places to eat around the area , except ice cream and junk food.try to visit at night as well .",1
"do n't do this if you 're scared of heights , because the stairs are exposed to the elements with only chicken wire enclosing them , so completely see through .",1
this would prove to be our undoing !,1
was quickly up and down .,1
you can climb or go all the way up .,1
lots of very pushy peddlers at the bottom that chase you if you look interested so avoid eye contact !,1
it is visible from many vantage points and no need to be crushed in an elevator .,1
you can not visit and miss out on this !,1
on the way we bought baguettes and drinks from a little shop we passed .,1
"you can wait 2 hours in line to go on the top , view is perfect - that 's not the question .",1
we were too late to go to top level but views from 2nd level were good enough,1
"no matter how many times you visit eiffel tower , you can get a new angle every time to sharpen your photography skills .",1
"we did not venture above the restaurant level , but the view was great from there .",1
there 's laser show at 8 p.m. every night .,1
travelled dec 2010 .,1
"when you grow up with the idea that eiffel tower is a unique place and a must seen and finally you had the chance to see , waw amazing experience and yes eiffel tower should be a dream that everyone should visit one day",1
but my favorite part and definitely scary is how you can stand on glass platforms that look down to the ground .,1
we went late afternoon to get up just before sunset and it was indeed the most amazing time to be there and see the sun set over paris and all the lights come on .,1
the highlight of our recent trip to paris was our day on the eiffel tower .,1
it did rain towards the end and by the time we got to the bottom it was pouring .,1
it never gets old .,1
one of a kind on plant earth .,1
we may be going down . '',1
such a wonderful experience .,1
"still , be prepared to be forced to endure herds of people .",1
there are informational placards on the walk up so you can learn a little more about this iconic structure .,1
"the lineups for the tower are long , as expected , and you can climb it on foot or wait for the lift to the first floor .",1
and men about 10 .,1
booked skip the line tickets in advance through ` get your guide ' .,1
"it 's massive , pretty tall .",1
"despite the 2 hours of long & boring queue , the views over paris are priceless .",1
i have not been in a line that was over 15 minutes when taking the stairs .,1
"the view from the 2 platforms is impressive , and i would recommend paying the few extra euro to get to the top , there was a long queue when we visited so did not do it .",1
we had to wait in line to get tickets then wait to get thru security then wait for the elevator .,1
"one the first viewing level , there are glass sections in the floor which you can walk on and look down if you are brave enough .",1
bleed for example a phone .,1
a great experience !,1
i been their last to last month while i was traveling back from marseille to india .,1
"i had my first pick-pocket experience here , so be extremely vigilant .",1
the tower gets painted every 10 years or so and it takes a large crew 5 months to do it .,1
we arrived late in the afternoon and were told the tower was 1 hours walk - so we walked and walked and 3 hours later we arrived but were not able to ride the tower as the last elevator was returned -lrb- that was about 11:30 pm -rrb- .,1
we really enjoyed going up the eiffel tower !,1
amazing architecture .,1
"it 's hard to think how impressive this structure is going to be before you are right in front of it , you know it 's big and it has been written about , photographed , used in movies and it is the symbol of one of the most vibrant and cultured cities in the world but until you are in its presence you wo n't truly share its perspective on the world and historical scene it has helped rule over .",1
"pack a snack , bottle of wine and a blanket or buy some yummy food from one of the stands .",1
the gift shop was very expensive and honestly did n't have anything worth buying in my opinion .,1
the restaurants are in the first & second level .,1
"we went on a public holiday , the line was n't long .",1
"we only went to the first level , but still enjoyed the view .",1
we then went down to the middle platform for more views .,1
it is truly an experience not to miss while in paris !!,1
heading to paris next week - would u need to order tickets online to enter or just que up + wait in line ?,1
can be a little bit crowded as it is so popular .,1
we got a beautiful clear and crisp february day and made our way to the top .,1
"she 's originally from argentina , but now lives in paris .",1
that reduces the queue and is a nice experience too .,1
"not only was this structure beautiful from multiple locations around the city , it was amazing going to the top .",1
"however , once you are on the elevator riding up , you 'll forget all about the wait .",1
try go to on a sunny day to get the maximum wow factor of the views .,1
the security measures were very reassuring and the tickets were n't as pricey as we 'd assumed they 'd be -lrb- about 17 euros each to go right to the top of the tower -rrb- .,1
"while the security fence surrounding the tower -lrb- put up after the terrorist attacks -rrb- is darn ugly , the tower itself remains beautiful and glorious .",1
we went in november and had a great experience .,1
i would advise trying to get tickets while you are still in your own country .,1
"although the line is way too long and the winter weather is bad for visiting the top floor , the close view of eiffel tower is still stunning .",1
"we waited ages in the rain to get into the eiffel tower , the staff were rude and you were all crammed in a lift .",1
we were n't going for an overpriced dining experience either .,1
"entrance is free , although you need to go through an extensive security check .",1
"it 's hardly a beautiful structure to look at , so we just came and took a few pictures then left .",1
it 's beautiful in that day and night .,1
"was expensive , about 400 per person , most likely because of the dinner !",1
"i was in paris for a week , but everyday was rainy .",1
though i had to stand in line to buy ticket but the process did n't take long .,1
fantastic macarons from shop on second floor .,1
perfect to do it at least once !,1
you will be submitted to a bag search and possibly a body scan wand .,1
it gets better in the evening - every hour the tour sparkles for a few minutes and it is quite a sight to behold .,1
champagne bar at top for those who want to spend money .,1
a must see for anyone visiting paris .,1
went to each level ... you can skip level one .,1
"so i surprised my wife with a trip to paris , and we done a few lovely things the louvre , notre dame , the love lock bridge , a walk along the river sienne where we ended up at the beauty of the eiffel tower , we chose to take a lift up to the top as the stairs just looked like it was too much effort but the view was something i will store in my memory until i die , looking at my beautiful wife whilst looking over paris has to be one of the best days of my life .",1
the top was closed but after getting to the 3rd floor that was plenty high for our 5 yr old .,1
watch out for the people selling stuff on the streets they trick you into buying their stuff .,1
it was n't until we exited the metro station and walked upon this magnificent sight that i realized just how massive it is .,1
-lrb- we suggest the security line opposite the carousel . -rrb-,1
the eiffel tower was amazing !,1
a definite must see .,1
extremely busy i peak times .,1
the park surrounding the tower is not one of my parisian favorites and would not recommend travelers dedicate any precious time to this trap .,1
"it 's a marvel to see even from the ground level , which is free , especially in the evening when it lights up .",1
"the earlier you get the , the less you 'll have to wait .",1
trust me if you are in paris this is a must to thing and its worth it .,1
we walked the 740 steps and had some champagne at the bar with a great view -lrb- 2 for $ 15 was n't bad -rrb-,1
"getting a chance to take family photos or selfies was minimal , everyone hogs their patch and is clicking away .",1
we then went back down to the first floor and had some lunch looking out over paris .,1
"if you go to paris , you must go to eiffel tower , but make sure you have early reservation to go up , because i did n't think it would be so busy and did n't buy ticket in advance .",1
the crowd seemed to be getting a little sketchy right outside the fences when we were leaving .,1
it takes time to get through security and then the lines to buy a ticket .,1
there are lots of nice photo opportunities and tourists galore .,1
"first they come closer to you , then asking `` do you speak english ? ''",1
"from the moment i saw this spectacular tower , it was a dream come true .",1
on the hour the tower is illuminated with sparkly lights for five minutes only .,1
our first view of the eiffel tower was about 7:30 am from the trocadero .,1
"if you want to fall in love again , just walk with your partner along the river seine with the eiffel tower in view !",1
we had skip the line tickets which i highly recommend as walking the stairs in that heat `` no thanks '' the lift can be a bit slow but it gets the job done .,1
so simply - it was terrific to be there .,1
"there are souvenir shops , a food buffet and story windows that tell the story of the construction of the eiffel tower on the second floor of the tower .",1
"the stairs are the best bit , and not very difficult -lrb- takes about 5 minutes -rrb- .",1
waste of cash and time - stay down below and take some snaps .,1
"this was the most exciting part of my trip to france ... it was more than just beautiful , but at night it took my breath away , , , , , ca n't wait to go back ...",1
or the alternative is to take the elevator to go up and climb down which is easier .,1
so if you want go on top make sure to book online .,1
"go to the summit if you can , it 's worth it !",1
it was amazing to watch the sunset .,1
we booked a tour through mon beau paris and had the best guide ever .,1
could not get to the summit due to weather but it was amazing .,1
go visit the monument but do n't bother going up .,1
we took the stairs to the second level as we 're fit and the line is shorter .,1
it 's worth the visit .,1
"amazing experience , goes without saying .",1
"the eiffel tower , symbol of the paris and france , romance , love , magical place , every time i come to this city for a walk here .",1
"the eiffel tower is a must in paris for tourists and there is certainly an exciting feeling as you approach the tower , however the scammers and souvenir hocking definitely encroaches on this experience .",1
words cant describe just go and experience this wonderful construction for yourself .,1
the main thing you want to see are the twinkling light show that is done every hour on the hour ... so pretty .,1
great location .,1
"there is a viewing platform undercover , which is great .",1
do not forget to purchase some souvenirs at the shop .,1
what can i say that has n't already been said about this place .,1
there is a history of the lifts video tucked away at the foot of the stairs down to the first level which is worth a watch .,1
"we took the cruise from -lrb- bateaux-mouches -rrb- , very nice and inexpensive 1.5 hours cruise .",1
"the day we went it was rainy , windy and cold .",1
its one of the most visited place on earth and rightly so .,1
"they have a lot of souveniers to buy right by the tower , plenty of food options and easy accessibility .",1
i absolutely love it !,1
"one of the places that must be seen in the life-time a beautiful example of architecture , nice place , realy nice",1
it is truly a sight to see - especially at night .,1
it is simply grand to see !,1
we were fortunate that the weather was clear and not too cool .,1
"great view , and a true classic .",1
this time we dined inside restaurant .,1
surprising that the crowds have not yet returned to paris .,1
love paris .,1
return at night when the tower puts on a light show .,1
many tourists look and keep on going but it was a thrill to study this masterpiece and its history .,1
of course we took a trip up and the view was gorgeous .,1
i wish we had booked a table for dinner at one of the restaurants which is accessible from a separate lift .,1
a must do if you are lucky enough to visit paris .,1
it is a must see and do at night .,1
you can go either by stairs or by elevator .,1
was n't disappointed .,1
i guess we went at a great time because i did n't find the lines to be particularly long .,1
"we were staying at the pullman tour eiffel , so we were only a few minutes ' walk away .",1
my wife and i visited paris last week .,1
regardless of any review you will get there anyway .,1
toured the eiffel tower on a trafalga coach tour .,1
"on the tour eiffel , i made him look out the windows of the elevator , saying , `` we seem to be going awfully fast .",1
"viewed by day or night this structure is an architectural marvel , the icon of paris .",1
it was very pleasant .,1
just beautiful - do n't miss it !,1
i would not go there with young children ... the crowds are just its just too much .,1
we did not have lunch reservations and were unable to get them .,1
we had to pay extra but went all the way to the top .,1
"unless you do not fancy a late start , then by all means , go early and queue up .",1
did n't find this out until i had lined up for 15 mins,1
like most paris icons now the experience of visiting the tower is more annoying as anything else .,1
very busy but worth queuing to get to the top .,1
"the heights at the top did n't bother our family but if you 're concerned , just go to the 2nd level .",1
the eiffel tower is a must do when in paris .,1
"cynisism aside , the tower is of course an astonishing piece of engineering and does provide outstanding views across the city .",1
"alternatively you can always opt to climb the tower , if you are physically up to it of course .",1
visit as the lights come on so you get to see her all lit up - that 's when she comes to life .,1
coming out the staff had closed 3 of the 4 lifts and there were hundreds of people trying to get down but every time the lift stopped it was full .,1
and glad that ive finally seen this last june .,1
"the main attraction in paris is turned into a fortress due to the terrorist menace : fence , guard cabins , police , checking the body pattern , no bottles allowed .",1
yes the lines are long but we bought our tickets from home on line from skip the line tours and had them delivered to our hotel .,1
we then climbed down to level 1 and just sat in the sun to absorb the atmosphere .,1
"people in a long cueue to get the ticket , i started to get in , and my patience was tests here .",1
go early to get close to the edge .,1
"lunch is good , not outstanding , serve on quirky dishes .",1
expect looong waiting lines on every floor .,1
this will save you time and queuing .,1
"visit this place twice , like we did : once during the day and again at night .",1
students here on a busy sunday afternoon and queued for almost 2 hours but there 's plenty to amuse you while you wait !,1
a must do if you are ever in paris .,1
otherwise anytime during the day is ok .,1
but on second top there is a lot of activities .,1
we booked tickets in advance up to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
it was very chaotic and not fun .,1
glad we booked it .,1
there is even a game like a treasure hunt !,1
the views from the top ... .,1
"the picnic lunch is around # 34 per person and for that you get a choice of starter , mains and dessert but it gets served in a picnic basket .",1
the lighting changes and the magic never fails .,1
"we then went up through a flight of stairs to the 2 nd floor where we took some awesome pictures , people who have bought summit access tickets could take a lift here to go to the top .",1
such an amazing iconic paris landmark .,1
a must visit for any traveler .,1
"the souvenir shop at the bottle is nice ; however , you can get some of the same items outside the monument for a little less money .",1
the monument is more impressive in person that in pictures or movies .,1
"having limited mobility meant my wife was not allowed to travel to the top , which in all honesty we were both quite glad off as you will not appreciate how high just the second floor of this tower is until you are riding up in the lift .",1
even liked walking up the stairs .,1
"would advise two visit , morning/night to see the light up .",1
good place to visit on nights .,1
i keep bringing my non-french friends visiting paris for the first time .,1
"if you are paris , it is definitely a must see .",1
we were sorry we missed seeing it at night to take a picture .,1
sounds a bit corny perhaps but really is spectacular .,1
what more can be said other than this being a truly amazing place to spend a romantic day and evening in paris !,1
what can you say about the eiffel tower in paris ?,1
plenty to see at the restaurant level .,1
"we had the pleasure of visiting the eiffel tower on a beautiful , warm october evening with no waiting in long lines .",1
surprisingly not overcrowded despite crowds at bottom .,1
"big queues , and a big disappointment !",1
i recommend it .,1
love the city .,1
there is a big line waiting but is so totally worth it !,1
defiantly go to the top .,1
i ca n't say enough on how beautiful this experiment was .,1
the old monument created by mr. eiffel remains a wonder and a delightful sight when it is lighted at night .,1
soooo beautiful specially with those sparkle light .,1
whilst in paris you must see the eiffel tower .,1
she 's everywhere you look .,1
we recommend seeing the eiffel tower during the day and night .,1
"i know , i know - if it 's your first time in paris , you basically have to see the eiffel tower .",1
"we had a great panorama view of paris , highly recommended to pre-order a lift ticket , we had to walk -lrb- 780 steps -rrb- , but it was a priceless view over paris",1
the views of the city from the second floor itself are really great .,1
we were still able to walk under the arches of the leg .,1
highly recommend this attraction !,1
"choose your time as is very crowded , the earlier the better .",1
the eiffel tower was one of my favorite things to see in paris .,1
"if you walk the stairs like we did just pay the $ 7 , we got sucked into stairs to level 2 and lift from there to the top for $ 12 , what we were n't told was at least 1hour wait for a lift from level 2 -lrb- after we already waited 45mins at the south pier for a ticket -rrb- so we admitted defeat and were just as happy with level 2 .",1
part of paris skyline and at night it 's lights up .,1
and while there mail a post card just for fun !,1
"we waited only about 20 mins for a ticket , fantastic , not that crowded once we were up there , with plenty of room to look around .",1
the views are absolutely outstanding .,1
after we finished lunch we stayed on the same floor for 30 minutes to get very nice photos of paris .,1
some of the things which you simply cant go wrong with .,1
i had no idea of the surprise the tower had every hour on the hour at night .,1
tickets can be bought at any of the tower pillars .,1
a must do visit .,1
if you are going there before the euro cup end and wish to see the semi finals or finals game you can go to the fans zone juz next to eiffel tower there 's a huge screen with eiffel tower as the backdrop .,1
we purchased are tickets in advance .,1
we landed in paris during one of the most gloomy days & the seine flooded its banks the next evening .,1
you can also stay as long as you like .,1
we were still able to get photos of us close to the tower .,1
as enchanting as ever .,1
in the next few days of our trip we saw what people were talking about .,1
"they first ask you if you speak english , then while you are distracted the other one is making the lift .",1
we forgot to book tickets online and the next available date was weeks after the end of our trip .,1
it is as awesome as you think it is .,1
just an incredible sight to behold .,1
we went at 10pm and managed to very easily get a ticket to the very top !!,1
ate at the restaurant on the second floor for my boygriend 's birthday in december 2015 .,1
the tower was lit up and it looked gorgeous .,1
"beautiful structure , it 's amazing at night when lit up just wish that it lasted longer .",1
it was a very windy day and it was freezing by the time we came down so wrap up warm is my first tip .,1
"can get a little windy so for travellers that belong to the tropical part of the world , do n't forget your windbreaker .",1
highly recommended to have dinner or drinks on the boats in the river below at night to watch the tower light up and sparkle .,1
i would recommend buying your tickets online if you plan to `` climb '' her .,1
at least go inside to the observation deck .,1
"the day we walked to the eiffel tower there were police everywhere , armed , with vans down the whole road , bomb squad !!",1
"you have to be patient , with kids it 's a bit tough , a lot of people visiting , a lot of queues , many times .",1
"to be fair , once at the top it is possible to walk around a bit more freely , and the view is stunning , but then its back into the melee for the return to earth .",1
it was cold any rainy so may not have been as crazy as other days but still worth the experience ;,1
it is a marvel and an enduring symbol of liberty .,1
the eiffel tower is after all the iconic parisian attraction .,1
we got great shots from dusk til dark .,1
"expect crowds , buy advance tickets , and know that the long-ish queues are part of the price of admission .",1
"our visit was on a clear but cool january day , but nothing could really reduce the excitement and amazement of visiting it .",1
"it is paris , but works better in the horizon .",1
"if you have the budget , climb to the top of the tower also .",1
staying around trocadero is the ideal location to see the tower and enjoy the area .,1
be careful of the slick games the gypsies will play to try to scam you of you money and belongings on the grass at the base of the eiffle tower !,1
if you only do one thing in paris make it the louve .,1
", and fantastic `` ant-people '' views from the second floor !",1
that really gives you a feel for the construction and is well worth doing .,1
"be sure to film the ride in the glass elevator , it was the most popular thing i brought home !",1
must see the eiffel tower sparkle nightly on each hour .,1
"surprisingly it was n't crowded as we expected , we went as part of a day trip from london through the channel tunnel and we had a very knowledgable guide who organised the bypass of the lines to by tickets .",1
unfortunately the tower was not lit up with the twinkle lights due to the period of mourning which we understood .,1
"to get there , take the yellow line to champ de mars - tour eiffel station .",1
the view up the tower -lrb- level 2 -rrb- is breathtaking .,1
a definite must visit in paris .,1
it can be tiresome to climb all the stairs .,1
very important if you value your time and do not want to waste time in a long line .,1
the best views of it are at night .,1
the restaurant with its panoramic views is worth the cost .,1
we saw the lines grow as the day went on .,1
went on a tour which included the eiffel tower as well as lunch we had a great time the food was good the views wonderful and we were n't rushed to leave loved it,1
went up in the height of summer via the stairs .,1
for those not a fan of lifts or heights it is honestly nowhere as scary as it appears .,1
lots of places to get the view .,1
go with a reputable tour .,1
the kids were awestruck !,1
gustave eiffel is probably rolling around in his grave for two reasons .,1
so please if you want to take a family picture you need to be far enough away from the tower to get a good pic .,1
we did not wait long to get our tickets and start our ascent to the top .,1
there are different tickets based on the level you wish to visit so be sure to pay attention that you are getting tickets to the top and not just the second level if that is what you want .,1
we also saw it during the day but the night view is awesome !,1
"impressive and beautiful , lots of people but it was very nice and organized .",1
we saw the daytime and the nighttime which is glorious with the sparkling / twinkling lights every hour .,1
"this is my third time to paris , and of course the third time to the eiffel tower .",1
taking in the view of paris from the observation decks is really amazing .,1
get there early to avoid queues if you want to climb the tower .,1
however the machinery proved to be more interesting to me than the view of paris !,1
waited for about an hour and a half and we were up the tower .,1
"when you stand in front of it , looking up , you will discover what i am talking about .",1
"the french symbol and hopefully , it has not been destroyed after the universal expo at the time .",1
can get very hectic and the queues are lengthy but boy are the views worth it when you get to the top .,1
the best prices on post cards and trinkets can be found at the surrounding plaza from the african and indian hawkers .,1
go in the evening near sunset for some great photos !,1
its very pretty yet the area is full of beggars and con artists so keep your wits about you .,1
lovely parks around it to sit and drink a bottle of wine and eat some amazing local produce .,1
it 's a truly outstanding construction .,1
ticket sales for all paris attractions are a scam between the oitlets and the attractions .,1
the view from the top is breathtaking !,1
i saw the eiffel tower 4 ways : first thru a vantage point from our sunset seine river cruise which was perfectly timed so we could see the tower lit up at night .,1
"great weather , could see for miles .",1
it is only 16 if you go in person .,1
"views were great , and at this time of year not too crowded .",1
u must see this once in your life at least .,1
what 's not to like .,1
"my son is three years old , however , the rude ticket office staff member insisted on charging for a child price , so we left the queue and went to another booth , the first staff member went out of his way and told the other ticket office staff member what had happened .",1
did n't climb the tower as it was too cloudy and would have been a waste of money as we would n't have been able to see much !,1
i feel like there are two things that can happen here ... you will either be amazed or you will think ... eh .,1
"we had limited time in paris , so booked around sunset to see the sights in daylight and in the dark .",1
bring a blanket because everyone is sitting and the ground was wet when we went .,1
such a magical experience for our last night in paris .,1
"if you want to go to the top , be careful which ticket/tour you purchase .",1
the lines for the elevators can be long and crowded .,1
and there are also lucky lucky men trying to sell souvenir 's .,1
we purchase our tickets for the summit online about 3 months in advance since we wanted a particular time .,1
and easy to get there on metro .,1
i love everything about the eiffel tower .,1
i understand that if you do not want to pay the absorbent prices offered by the tour companies you need to buy them on line from the tourist board 2 months beforehand .,1
nice green surroundings and if one goes to the very top the city can be clearly seen .,1
a bit disappointed after our visit this year - you can no longer walk underneath the tower as it has been blocked off with unsightly temporary fences !,1
"it was very windy and chilly accompanied by intermittent rain , but absolutely worth it .",1
this is just one of those things you have to do when you visit paris !,1
"me and my mommy visited the tower at night , which was perfect because we caught the great light show !",1
what a great way to take in its glory and enjoy each other 's company !,1
we were travelling in paris at the end of june & were amazed how short the lines were to get up the eiffel tower .,1
paris would n't be the same without it .,1
amazing ...,1
"we booked tickets online , this company took money from our credit card and said a confirmation email would follow within 24-48 hours , detailing instructions of our meeting point etc. .",1
you have to see this at least once in a lifetime !!,1
it is quieter and less crowded .,1
suggest checking into it .,1
"yes it 's amazing but there is nothing to it that you have n't seen on a photo of it or on tv , except the huge queues .",1
we saw this place for like 3 to 4 times during our short trip and clicked every possible angle .,1
we took a guided tour to the eiffel tower and i am very glad .,1
views are amazing as expected .,1
you will be glad you have done it .,1
walk across the bridge to th nice sight and enjoy a ice cream as you walk .,1
this is my third visit to the tower and it was as great as each other time .,1
"good view of all of paris and it was the perfect place to have a glass of champagne to celebrate , although quite pricey at $ 22 per glass .",1
"first timers really should plan for a visit up the tower to see a panoramic view of the city , but if it is too crowded know that the views from the ground -lrb- take lots of selfies -rrb- are priceless .",1
we did both the daytime and night-time tours ...,1
come on .,1
"a must in paris , but it would not hurt if another color was chosen when repainting .",1
"for those who are new to paris , go as early in the day as possible to avoid the crowds .",1
there is a separate line for reservatiions if you print out an advance-purchase voucher or have printed a restaurant reservation .,1
a group of us were fortunate to be in paris for bastille day 2016 .,1
something u have to see at least once in your lifetime !,1
surprised that it did n't take much time .,1
i 'm 6 ' 1 '' tall and 230 lbs .,1
we read up on the history of the tower before we went and it lived up to its history and hype .,1
"we walked to the eiffel tower everyday and explored the area and stumbled into a home cooked meals sign place so we decided to check it out ... it was the best decision we made coz the food was excellent , the owner and the waitress were very friendly and nice and gave us the full authentic parisian dining experience with ambiance !!",1
"the eiffel tower and trocadero are beautiful , a french pride :-rrb- but there are so many beggars , it is heart breaking ... is paris a capital of poverty or is it a niche for dodgy activities ?",1
better than we dreamed .,1
it was quite dark inside the restaurant and with the structure of the tower good photos were limited .,1
a once in a life time meal at le jules verne .,1
"loved the eiffel tower , all staff very friendly , took the lift up and came back down the steps .",1
well no reason this place is the most visited monument in the world .,1
we arrived in paris late on the 30th december 2015 and were staying just a short walk from the eiffel tower .,1
if you come to paris you have to visit the eiffel tower .,1
it is almost overwhelming the amount of them working the grounds .,1
there is heavy security getting into all attractions .,1
we went on a tour starting with a river cruise along the seine followed by a trip up the eiffel tower .,1
"went to paris for valentines night , eiffel tower was lit up to look sparkly .",1
"i mean , there ´ s nothing much to say about the eiffel tower , wait until it ´ s 10 p.m. -lrb- summer -rrb- and then enjoy the awesome light show .",1
"i thought `` ok so it 's a tall building , how great can it be '' -lrb- having visited the burj khalifa -rrb- and was blown away .",1
there was a very long queue though but the whole wait was worth it - the view is breathtakingly beautiful .,1
avoid the tacky street sellers and enjoy quieter gardens away from crowds .,1
the only done side would be the pushy hawkers selling horrible tacky souvenirs and the bothersome gypsies .,1
learn about the role the tower had during ww2 and soldiers departing for duty from there .,1
tip : visit at night the best to see the lights coming out from the tower,1
took a tour which was interesting enjoyed the history behind it used fat tire tours my 15 year old niece thoroughly enjoyed,1
i do highly recommend the fat tire tour that does allow you to bypass some of the lines .,1
there is a long line for lift also long line for stairs that you need to pay for walk !,1
make sure you go across the street once dark as they turn the light show on for a few minutes on the top of the hour .,1
great place to forget about the world for awhile despite that .,1
been before but felt we should do again .,1
on the top floor we can toast whit champagne and having an unforgettable moment !,1
no queues and straight up to the top for fabulous views over the city .,1
"cold , but a good time to come as queues were minimal .",1
"it only took 30 minutes from the time i got in line at the base to get to the summit , i imagine it takes a lot longer in the summer or spring .",1
it 's a typical tourist paris landmark .,1
it 's definitely worth for paying to go up to the eiffel tower cuz the view is amazing !!!!,1
we were only there for 5 days and i think we ended up visiting 3-4 occasions .,1
"the behind the scenes tour is good , but to be honest i was hoping for something more in depth than it was .",1
what can we say ?,1
huge !,1
i 'm sure many people love it but we thought the view from the pedestal was just perfect for us .,1
we did n't book tickets before we got them on the day and did n't cue at all .,1
what a magical experience .,1
"catch the video as well , and check out the restrooms .",1
travelled to paris in october with the family.lovely to see at night .,1
"i have been traveling here for years and each time i go , it feels like its my first time .",1
"heard a lot about the experience that eiffel tower brings to the visitors , but you have to visit to experience it .",1
walking around the tower on the ground is also interesting to just see the construction and the bases -lrb- huge bases -rrb- !!!,1
very pretty lit up at night !,1
we did n't feel like waiting over an hour in line to ride up to the very top so we took the stairs down -lrb- much faster than waiting in line for the elevator -rrb- .,1
it was an amazing view !!!,1
fortunately i was with a tour group whom had a priority entry .,1
the twinkling lights goes on every hour for 5 minutes .,1
you can not leave paris without a trip up the eiffel tower .,1
nice to see that paris is `` a white city '' with so many ekegant buildings .,1
but beware are the vendors harassing you to buy curios .,1
"impressive , this is magnificent .",1
"if you only go to two places in paris , make them the louvre and the tower .",1
the views of the city are amazing .,1
"the police were out in full force , but between chasing off unlicensed street vendors -lrb- guys walk around trying to sell you stuff -rrb- and questioning french groups of teens -lrb- pickpockets grab your stuff , then hand off and hand off so you 'll never catch who actually grabbed your phone -rrb- they ca n't really catch the guys in action .",1
go to the top of the tower is a must !,1
"but when we were taking the boat tour , it was also very stunning to see it from below .",1
this is an amazing edifice .,1
the third -lrb- highest level -rrb- is only open until 10 pm .,1
there are other places to go up to get a good view of the city -lrb- arc de triomphe & montparnasse tower -rrb- .,1
who says you need computers !!,1
the line moved pretty quickly once it opened and the only delays were the security check points that i really appreciate them having.make sure you immediately go to the highest observation deck as once that gets filled up you will have to wait in line even on the first level of the tower .,1
its an amazing experience and offers a great alternative for those who are visiting paris in winter .,1
do n't need to say any more - 3rd time i 've been and it 's still a work of art .,1
so glad i went to see it though .,1
the tour companies buy up a lot of the tickets and then bundle them with other attractions .,1
how to visit paris france without seeing the eiffel tower ?!!!,1
crowded but manageable .,1
we tried to book tickets 3 months in advance to skip the line to the top but they 'd sold out !,1
"well what can you say about the eiffel tower that has n't been said 100 times before , a simply magnificent structure , an icon , a must for anyone visiting paris obviously .",1
we went to the eiffel tower on saturday afternoon .,1
the only thing i dont like are the salesgiys everywhere with selfysticks and small towers .,1
we enjoyed the skip the line priority access but would have liked more info from the tour guide .,1
you can look out and see all of france from the main deck .,1
... and when in paris you need to visit the eiffel tower .,1
we booked online a few months before going up the eiffel tower for a sunset -lrb- 8pm -rrb- ascent to the top and we are so glad we did .,1
buy a ticket and take it to the top as lights come on in paris .,1
i booked this via the link on the official site through cultival .,1
"we got lots of great photos of us , the view , and the tower .",1
this year we booked vip tickets a few months before and we 're able to skip the queues .,1
we went half an hour before sunset .,1
we opted to walk up to the second floor where we could purchase tickets for the lift to the top .,1
oh well still a remarkable place .,1
"be prepared for large crowds , selfies , trinket sellers - a whole world that has the tower as the center of the universe !",1
what a wonderful and romantic monument .,1
if you go to paris you have to go .,1
light show on every hour from 7pm .,1
so gorgeous .,1
"walked up to the second level , quite frightening if you do n't like heights !",1
entry price was reasonable and didnt have to queue for long .,1
though this is n't the architecture genius as the vatican or even notre dame cathedral it is a magnificent piece of architecture iconic of paris .,1
"therefore , we were a bit surprised by how bad organized the place was .",1
what is a visit to paris without seeing this iconic attraction ?,1
an incredible feat of architecture and engineering !,1
"the end result was my sister and i falling back onto our eiffel tower tradition of sharing a hot sugar donut with nutella -lrb- strategically taken from the hotel breakfast buffet -rrb- , and sipping hot chocolate .",1
it feels like i 'm in a movie or show .,1
we still had a great time as the weather was cold but otherwise fabulous during our december visit .,1
visited on a cold and windy february afternoon and got to the tower before our admittance time -lrb- our fault -rrb- so had to wait around for our time slot .,1
"it was incredible to be walking in paris , on the lookout for the eiffel tower , peering between buildings and through trees , until it came into view : `` there it is ! ''",1
what a wonderful experience - i ca n't wait to come back .,1
such a tourist cliché but you must see it while there .,1
takes a while and give your legs a good burn .,1
ok cool to say i 've done this .,1
we went in june 2012 and only one elevator was working .,1
and it can get foggy so you will want to go more mid day time so you are not disappointed with the views .,1
we first saw the eiffel tower from the river seine at night and it was a spectacular sight .,1
"we have stayed until it got a lil darker to see it light up , very stunning .",1
worth very euro !,1
"i am glad i have seen it , but have no desire to return .",1
so go across the street for a better view .,1
queued for a while to buy tickets and then go through security but well worth the wait .,1
"also the views of the city from top is the reason to visit eiffel tower ... expect long lines at the ticket counter , at the elevator - both up and down ... better book tickets online ... the tower looks good with the led light show that happens for 5 minutes every hour ...",1
their staff was very friendly and well organized .,1
just has to be seen .,1
"no matter how many times i go to paris , i always have to stop by the tower at night .",1
watch for pick pockets especially the seemingly pregnant girls that will distract you .,1
the second deck was closed but got a few pics .,1
wonder of the world .,1
we got up early on a sunday morning and got there before it open to beat the rush to purchase ticket since we did not pre book .,1
we could not get tickets to the top but once we got there there were some to buy .,1
it was an amazing experience to go before the huge queue and it was worth every euro .,1
did n't know about the extensive additional security so leave at least 30-40 minutes to get through the queues and bag checks .,1
the lines for the lift are very long when purchasing tickets so i chose to walk all the way up .,1
but go see her .,1
"do a skip the line tour , helps cut down on the stress .",1
the price to go all the way in an elevator is $ 14 for under 23 's which we thought was a good price as there was no time limit as to how long you could go up for .,1
"there is a posh restaurant part the way up , you will need to book to get a table here .",1
this is one of those `` ca n't miss '' landmarks that should be on everyone 's bucket list .,1
"only warning is that there were ladies asking people who spoke english for names and addresses to benefit children who are deaf-there were so many of these women who were eager to the point of aggressive indicating that they were n't really collecting for charity , but rather a group scamming tourists .",1
"it was fabulous , outside of the crowds and the deplorable bathroom facilities .",1
the memory will last forever .,1
we went right to the top and the views are incredible .,1
so at night can be very windy .,1
wish i had had the courage to go to the top !!,1
then back down the lift to the second level .,1
trip to the tower were not allowed .,1
"from our table , it was clear to see why paris is called the city of lights .",1
the price to go to only the firts floor is 9 euro and to go to the top -lrb- summet -rrb- is 17 euros .,1
remember arrive as early as possible .,1
well you have to see the eiffel tower .,1
he shared historical information as well as anecdotes .,1
i know the lines are more crowded near dusk and for the evening .,1
recommend getting the express passes .,1
you can get to the second level which is plenty high to see everything -- it 's 690 steps .,1
"we did n't go up bc my kids did n't want to and also the bathrooms only the , aides room was open and so my seven year old had issues bc she needed her dad to go in with her .",1
apart from that a must see place,1
"cruise by on a boat at night , the view is completely different at night .",1
"watch yourself in the area , unfortunately there are pick pockets who will take advantage while you are amazed with the beauty of the tower .",1
we went there really late and almost when it was about to close .,1
like most iconic monuments in cities across the world it is very popular and can get busy at most times of the day so plan ahead .,1
make sure you purchase tickets to the appropriate level .,1
during the day we walked up to the second level to avoid the extreme lines of people waiting for the lift .,1
the view was lovely.my husband and children went up to the top but it was so windy that they only stayed about a minute before making their way back down .,1
fortunately i saw the eiffel tower in the night .,1
if the price to go to the very top was a bit cheaper i would have gone up there .,1
it 's a bit scary walking on the glass door .,1
my husband and i visited the tower several times through out our visit in paris .,1
12 people in all met and the agent took us straight to the priority access .,1
everyone thats visits paris should go !!,1
i expected it to be busy and hard to move around but even at the top it was n't at all crammed .,1
"we went right before sunset , where we got some great pictures during daylight , and then once it gets dark , the tower is lit up and sparkles !",1
most wanted place to go in paris .,1
all the way .,1
really cool visit !,1
unconditionally beautiful `` every moment of the year ! '',1
... iceskating in on the first floor .,1
"on a previous visit to paris , i had walked under this amazing structure several times , but resisted the impulse to join long lines to go up .",1
and not crowded .,1
the ticket to top costs $ 17 which is worth it .,1
"as a result , there were throngs of people , tourists and locals , leading to very long lines ; so much so , that we had to forego the evening ride to the top .",1
but this year i had the chance of going back and i was able to enjoy the perfect view of paris that the tower provides .,1
then the lifts were so jam packed to get to the top .,1
whilst visiting with my girlfriend we seen the winter sparkles and the tower did n't let us down .,1
next time : -lrb-,1
"go during the day for pictures or to go up the tower , but return at night to see the twinkling lights that start every hour on the hour .",1
we were there both day and night which gave you a very different prospective of the tower .,1
fantastic tour !!!,1
"you definitely should go to the top , really amazing views .",1
"looking up at this landmark i was amazed but after getting in the two lifts to the top , wow , what a view .",1
"the eiffel tower is great and the view is extraordinary , but pickpockets and scam artists are everywhere !",1
"this is one of the best landmarks you will ever see , especially when it lights up at night .",1
but sadly the q 's were too big in august to go up it ... another time !,1
"some 500 employees are responsible for its daily operations , working in its restaurants , manning its elevators , ensuring its security and directing the eager crowds flocking the tower 's platforms to enjoy panoramic views of the city of lights .",1
but what a problem it became .,1
"when we got there , there was a que , but it moved fairly quickly .",1
you can see the whole paris from there .,1
other than not wanting to walk up the stairs or wait in line for the elevator that was working we had a nice visit .,1
the thai wife and i visited the tower on a wet morning .,1
it was cold and very windy and there was a 20 minute queue to get into the elevators to the top .,1
"however we were a little bit disappointed that all the tags for the attractions from the past were removed , so sometimes you are not sure were to look for a specific one .",1
"there were long queues on the day we visited , so book your tickets online if possible , and hope for good weather , because the views are breathtaking .",1
ok ... views wow etc but i think it 's a bit hyped up .,1
it lived up to all of my expectations i loved it so much !,1
will go back again next time i 'm in paris .,1
i was on a tour bus and i did n't bother to get off near the eiffel tower but i got close enough to see it really close .,1
"so boy scouts be aware , do not come `` ever prepared '' .",1
i waited 2 hours in the row .,1
"the experience may frustrate you , but you 'll be glad you put forth the time and effort .",1
"lots of hawkers outside , but still a must-see experience .",1
did n't make it right to the top as there was a 35 minute wait so we went to the 2nd and the glass floor level .,1
i will say that my husband and i are 22 and saw very few people taking the steps that were not between 10 and 35 .,1
you get a very good view from one of the seine boat tours .,1
we had to queue at the eiffel tower for nearly 2.5 hours to get to the lift which took us up .,1
"omg and if you can also visit at night , it is utterly beautiful all lit up !",1
it would be a shame to go all the way to paris and not see the eiffel tower .,1
beware of gypsys that will surround you here .,1
"visiting the eiffel is a must , right ?!",1
we pre-booked a time and getting into the base was not a problem .,1
so here it goes -,1
we had tickets for 10.30 in the morning .,1
then through another security check and up the elevator to the middle platform .,1
yes your stomach can act up as you catch the 2nd lift to the top but worth the fantastic geographical view from the top ... .,1
we went there over easter break with 2 children ... security line outside the site was about 30 minutes long .,1
i was apprehensive that we would be waiting in a huge line .,1
"the higher one , jules verne is very tough to get in and obviously pricier .",1
"first of all , the good points .",1
"after sunset , we were there this month -lrb- april -rrb- , 9pm it lit up and for the first five minutes on the hour every hour she sparkles .",1
it 's an icon of course .,1
there is a restaurant there also which was quite busy .,1
you have to stand in line : -lrb-,1
very majestic and imposing structure .,1
it is impressive to see how big it really is in person .,1
1st floor itself is at a good height that it makes the tourist feel the people walking on streets are ants .,1
"i have been to paris on several previous occasions , but i never go a trip without a taking the time to go up to take in paris from above .",1
the first time -lrb- summer 2015 -rrb- we took the subway to get there and then approached it from the northwest where you walk down from the top of the hill and cross the river .,1
lots of tourists and lots of people selling souvenirs .,1
i went up the 1st level using stairs and did not buy the ticket to use the elevator .,1
we also went back for evening visit where it becomes more magical .,1
the view is excellent from trocadero which is also a metro stop .,1
the lines are looooong .,1
avoid busy times .,1
there was a 15 minute line to buy the tickets but just a 10 minute line to go to the top at 7:15 pm .,1
x,1
-lrb- we went mid november -rrb- i was disappointed thinking we would not enjoy the experience and have wasted the money to go .,1
well worth it to learn the history & know what you 're looking at from the top .,1
long cues .,1
packed lifts .,1
every half hour the lights in eiffel tower starts to flash it is so beautiful .,1
it took us about 3-4 hours total to make our way up there and get down with very long lines for tickets and then for the elevator ride but it was worth it .,1
a 20 minute stroll from the arc de truimph and we found ourselves getting an eyeful of the eiffel tower .,1
but for me : is not worth it .,1
it was then that we felt the charm of eiffel tower and looked at it in awe with its lights .,1
"i highly recommend going up to the very top -lrb- it 's a special ticket , make sure you buy the right one -rrb- .",1
"started the boat ride at notre dame , had great ride on the boat .",1
the tower is enclosed in a chain link fence and there are many trinket salesman who keep bothering you .,1
a shot looking up from below can really give you a new perspective on its grandeur .,1
the pick pocket is active at this attraction .,1
it was also enjoyable to view the tower from underneath and the nearby park .,1
we had booked the tickets using their online website and had them printed for the day of visit .,1
"ok so we made a whistle stop tour under the eiffel tower on our way to another tour in paris but it was worth a quick stop , although i do n't think i 'd necessarily have waited hours to venture up it .",1
the eiifel tower is an amazing place to visit !!,1
the crowds are n't too bad and at 9 p.m. the lights come on and the sparkle begins .,1
"we thought bread and cheese , perhaps wine !",1
you can walk or take the elevator to the first floor where there is a section of the floor that is glass that you can walk on and see the view beneath your feet .,1
best time to visit eiffel is at night.is a unique experience which need to see at least one time in a life.what a beauty work a man can do !,1
its breathtakingly beautiful at night and the views of paris are worth the trip up !,1
the queueing system is a little haphazard - the signposting is minimal .,1
security was very tight .,1
look the eiffel tower is literally the most recognized man made structure in the world .,1
went to the top of the eiffel tower on a warm july afternoon in 2016 .,1
well it 's one of the best attractions in the world so went and had a look .,1
it was very good experience .,1
be on guard .,1
you can entire paris from there .,1
retched port a potties .,1
what can anyone say about the eiffel tower .,1
"we in the us gave the statue of liberty , the grand canyon and several other places of such stature , but the french have their tower in easier access than most .",1
the queuing system at the base is unnecessarily unorganized .,1
"it can get cold and windy , even on a hot day .",1
we decided to go straight to the summit before it got too busy .,1
you have to do the stair climb as this has a short line to the ticket box .,1
the trinkets sellers are annoying !,1
we were inside the area where the tower is at about 9:10 and had our tickets by 9:15 .,1
it was a real adventure and among our daughters ' favorite paris memories .,1
going up is a must .,1
so glad i finally got to see it !,1
we had good rain covers with hoods so this did not bother us that much .,1
"with the long summer days of light until 10:30 pm , go see the eiffel tower with fat tire .",1
the view is amazing and unmatched in the city .,1
climb the steps and take the elevator to the top .,1
the staff said we were only entitled to a partial refund as we had done part of the tour .,1
go early or expect crazy line ups .,1
it is a little confusing when you initially get there because there seems to be lineups everywhere but there are entrances at each of the four `` feet '' of the tower -lrb- although all of them are not always open at one time -rrb- .,1
we also saw it twinkle at 10pm .,1
"need advance tickets , go near sunset , great for photo 's ~ take your time , do n't rush .",1
you have read all of the other reviews of the eiffel tower .,1
"we attempted to receive a partial reimbursement for paying for a visit to the top , but not being able to actually get to it , however they gave us the runaround and we dropped it .",1
we are not much for long lines and opted to skip that .,1
marvel at the engineering and the elevator system which was a struggle in 1897 when they wanted all french construction but finally had to ask otis to supply the inclined elevators between ground and second floor .,1
careful of you belongings .,1
"being one of the tallest structures in the city , it is visible from pretty much everywhere , but the best places to photograph it are from the trocadero , from bir hakeim metro and the montparnasse tower .",1
"we were back in paris shortly afterward the bombings in october , so there was barely a wait .",1
well that 's what we did on our family trip and it was just simply amazing .,1
it takes my breath away every time !,1
underneath the tower there is quite some police but always be aware .,1
amazing deserts and greater views .,1
"be sure to go by day , you can see everything better and photos are the best .",1
right from the plane to the tower - now that was a culture shock .,1
"also , if you are doing the river cruise at night or the bus tour , you do not need to choose a separate tour for this .",1
i have been there before and it was just as beautiful .,1
"hilarious now , but when we went , the tower was closed as the electrical union was striking and the elevator was `` not working '' .",1
still an enjoyable tour giving us insight to france 's history !,1
it 's worth while taking your time at each level and enjoying views offered at each stage .,1
they even have restrooms at the summit .,1
would definitely recommend purchasing tickets in advance like we did !,1
"the beautiful structure , the thrill of the stairs , the excitement of the lift .",1
worked well .,1
embarrassingly we had to wait aside for someone to deal with the issue .,1
"the people , the food , the atmosphere was fantastic",1
"if you want to go up the tower , definitely buy your tickets online .",1
you get to skip the line and go right up .,1
it looks much nicer when it is illuminated .,1
"for some reason , i always imagined the eiffel tower would just be tall but not huge .",1
"to be stood next to it , does n't disappoint .",1
"the tour guide was a young british guy and he was so knowledgeable , funny and keen to make sure we had a great experience .",1
we made it to the very top and loved every minute of the tour .,1
during our week long stay in paris we walked by twice both during daylight and night and went up to the top .,1
"the biggest turn off was hearing that 3 days prior to our visit , the eiffel tower was shut down for a couple of days .",1
"i went on two different days , one when it was sunny and one when it was raining .",1
it has got three floors and one has access to all of them but there are tickets for each level .,1
we were lucky enough to go ice skating on the first floor ... only 5 euro,1
its hard to get reserved times .,1
"amazing , worth the travel",1
beware of pickpocket !,1
there is a dock station just in front of the tower .,1
we ended up purchasing a tour package of the eiffel tour which turned out to be very interesting and it was n't much more expensive than regular tickets .,1
if you come to paris you have to go up the eiffel tower .,1
saved at least an hour queuing !,1
we 've visited paris for a first time in june .,1
the whole garden and area around it is beautiful .,1
"but if you show up when it 's crowded , which could be anytime during good weather , and sometimes during bad , you can wait in line for hours .",1
overall the queue took about two hours and was a bit disorganised but the experience is so good it is well worth the effort .,1
quite cold so wrap up warm -lrb- october visit -rrb- .,1
that was very disappointing .,1
"the view from the top is incredible , however you must get there early as to try and miss the extremely long queues .",1
at the time of booking we could only get to the 4th level .,1
the drive upto the tower and the magnificent views from it are wonderful,1
"did n't ` skip the line ' , but it was n't terrible .",1
we ate at the jules verne - second time for us .,1
"and do not miss the night illuminations , happening every hour after dark for 5 minutes , best viewed from the trocadero .",1
as a result there were few queues at ground level .,1
i emphasize printed because some people in line had to go get real tickets when they only could display their tickets on their phone .,1
you can not miss the eiffel tower if you are in paris .,1
way cheaper this way and some good exercise to burn off the baguettes and wine .,1
purchase tickets way in advanced for a time slot to ride up on the elevators .,1
when we visited the queue to take the lifts was extremely long but the queue for the stairs was empty .,1
we made it to the upper-middle platform -lrb- as we did n't pay to go all the way to the top -rrb- .,1
"it 's a must see , it was beautiful and the views were stunning .",1
the holy grail of travel is to find the hidden treasures while in paris .,1
the queue for the lifts was long but the stairs queue was only 15 mins .,1
it keeps going every hour till midnight for 5mins,1
"i suggest you to visit paris not in may-july , because the queue to go up is loooooooooong enough to make you rethink twice or even more while queueing whether you want to continue the struggle or not .",1
and even better at night !,1
toilets are queued on the eiffel tower and are quite small .,1
but be ready for extreme crowds and be careful od pick pockets .,1
definitely not to be missed .,1
that moment was one of my favorites and memorable of all my travels .,1
"i just love paris and the eiffel tower is amazing , i love it more at night time when it is lit up , it is more elegant .",1
"long lines if one wishes to tide to the top , but the park area and viewing is good from ground level .",1
we stayed near the eiffel tower and went to visit both during the day and night .,1
what a great evening !,1
"while not considered once of the cities national monuments , it 's still a must .",1
buy a glass of champagne for sure .,1
we went to the summit 5 years ago and this time brought our teenage kids .,1
i felt this was a bit off given that at the bottom it did n't tell you this was the case .,1
views were amazing and we were blessed with a clear day .,1
all the security and guns maybe me feel like i was at an event waiting to happen .,1
the eiffel tower is exactly what it says on the tin .,1
we went to see the eiffel tower at night -lrb- 9pm -rrb- and made sure we were there for the 5 minute per hour spectacle of the tower illuminated with twinkling lights - gorgeous and free,1
interesting architecture .,1
i went back a few hours later when it was dark .,1
absolutely stunning view from the top !,1
"the eiffel tower is fantastic , even though it is now more difficult to access due to security concerns .",1
it 's one of favourite landmarks in paris .,1
beware of the gypsy games .,1
wrap up warm as it gets pretty chilly !,1
we did n't end up climbing the tower but it is definitely a must see .,1
the meal was average at best with fine dining prices .,1
it was freezing cold but it was perfect !,1
"light show fantastic , lifts a bit wobbly from second level , hang on",1
it a sight to marvel .,1
"the say paris is a very romantic city , well they did not lie , i spent a wonderful time in paris , i said i would never travel to paris unless the right person was with me to enjoy the moment and to share the wonderful atmosphere that paris has to offer you ,",1
can access the lift on the way back down .,1
it 's an amazing experience !,1
"well , its a lie !",1
a definite must .,1
if you are in paris you have to see the eiffel tower .,1
"we had just come off a tour of italy , when someone had just been before the tour suggested we take the stairs up to the first floor , then take the elevator to avoid standing in the huge lines .",1
food on cafe really expensive $ 14 for hot dog and coffee .,1
we went on top it was memorable .,1
it was supposed to be brought down after the 1900 's world fair and has a rich history beyond the obvious scenic aspect .,1
coffee fab and reasonable .,1
"this was the eiffel tower , the heart of paris ; but i expected more .",1
armed soldiers patrol all the streets .,1
"we purchased our tickets online ahead of time , for an 8 pm entry .",1
"but be careful with your belongings , there are a lot of pickpockets and scammers on its surroundings .",1
"we went to the summit , but once is probably enough .",1
fun time and a must see !!!,1
"if you get a chance , read the history of the naming of the metro station .",1
i am not fit so i could have sworn it almost killed me but the view was worth it .,1
"bring some wine , perhaps some cheese , and make a picnic of it .",1
we had a 12 noon appointment and the crowd was very minimal .,1
why was i disappointed ?,1
you should really go inside the eiffel tower and climb the stairs in some parts even if you have a ticket for the elevators .,1
"lines are long to visit the top , but it is just as fun to sit on the lawn for a while and gaze at it .",1
lines moved reasonably .,1
the steps to 2nd floor nearly killed us but worth it .,1
there was also people sitting on the floor eating while tours were taking place and it was not attractive .,1
"while the top level tickets sold out when we were still in queue , they opened up again as we went up to the second level .",1
it was awesome visit .,1
"obviously this is a must for paris , surprisingly inexpensive and an unforgettable experience , great views of paris",1
"we did not that when the light faded a bit , about 7-8pm the queues for tickets were gone , maybe that 's a better bet in peak season .",1
instead we walked by the very many stands with fast food and other treats and had a coffee and ice cream .,1
the parisians wanted to remove this masterpiece as they thought it was ugly .,1
"lines were long , however , but once through the security perimeters there is complete freedom to wander .",1
it was n't packed yet with tourists .,1
"la tour eiffel is one of the most recognisable landmarks in the world , and for good reason .",1
go all the way to the top and see paris from a birds eye view .,1
this is the third time i went eiffel but this time it made me fell great than the first and second time cause my friend told me about the story of eiffel ... so ... let start,1
"there are cafes and shops on both levels , with toilets and great souvenirs , although slightly expensive .",1
we then proceeded to the top for incredible views toasted by a glass of champagne !,1
going to the tip top really helps satisfy that dream .,1
you the have to go down to the first floor to get the tickets but none tells you and there on signs to tell you .,1
the stairs are not that difficult and do n't take that long .,1
"with a reserved ticket you will have a specific entrance time and you will not be able to exchange it later , so the reservation means you plan your day around it .",1
"the tower is not a quick stop , though it seems like it should be .",1
the view at night when the lights go on and shimmer every hour like a firework display was the most special indeed .,1
"first glimpse was from the arc de triomphe ... it was night and you could see it off in the distance - i thought that was moving , but then my brother says ` want to go ? '",1
"we travelled by the underground to the tower , easy and cheap to get there from the latin quarter .",1
"the tower is french in its character that is unusual , detailed , perfectly proportioned , man-made with its idiosyncrasy .",1
must if you are visiting paris .,1
"recommend getting a skip-the-line tour or tickets in advance , because you will have to wait in line either way -lrb- just much shorter if you are part of a tour -rrb- .",1
unbelievable considering the stress they put customers through even though they had admitted it was their mistake .,1
really beautiful !,1
do n't bother getting tickets to the top in advance because you never know what the weather will be like .,1
but what worked for us was buying in advance on line at the official site .,1
my friend and i visited right before the euro 2016 games so there was a lot of stuff going on for that around the tower .,1
trocadero garden unkept with rubbish and homeless people and no water fountains were working when we were there in may .,1
there are alot of illegal street vendors selling cheap eiffel tower trinkets which can be intimidating to tourists .,1
the sights were unbelievable a must see and must do if you go to paris .,1
"beautiful tower , the ride up is very neat , at a slant , the views are breath taking but signs of pick pockets and people pestering you to buy junk is unnerving .",1
"waited in line less than 10 minutes and then got our tickets , went through security and started the 670 step trek .",1
we were at the base of it .,1
and just walking a little to surround avenue neighborhoods you can find some amazing cafes and bistros to take a coffee or hot chocolate or a glass of wine or eat .,1
"as the major icon of paris , france the effiel tower is a sight to behold in the daytime and especially when the tower is bathed in light .",1
"the lights on eiffel tower blinks every hour at night , best to see it across the road than on top of the tower .",1
"every strike 12 after sun goes down , there 's hundreds of lights blinking along its length , creating blink-blink effect .",1
what a grand night !,1
especially when they light up the tower and the sparkling begins .,1
obviously the eiffel tower is an absolute must when visiting paris for many people so as a typical tourist me and my partner took 2 trips to the tower .,1
wow wow wow !,1
one of those must see sites .,1
"be warned , there are lots of people who target tourists with their trinkets and bottles of wine to drink in the park .",1
we spent a short time to walk around and enjoy this great site .,1
"no sooner had we got to the parkland around it , than about 10 people swarmed around us trying to sell glowing eiffel towers or roses .",1
from start to finish -lrb- we took nearly three hours ! -rrb-,1
we made one visit in the day and one visit at night .,1
"the top stage was closed during our visit , but this is unmissable .",1
it 's absolutely worth going up right to the top !,1
"the eiffel tower all lit up at night is one of the most beautiful sights in the world , if you 're scared of heights like i am dont even consider going up it because it is extremely high even on the second level .",1
i love how eiffel tower would shine every hour especially when it is at night .,1
i enjoyed my time there .,1
i think it is a dream of everyone to see the eiffel tower atleast once in their lives so it was a must see .,1
"we went with the childrens , it 's just amazing each time !",1
so beautiful !,1
and the best part of it is when you watch it sparkling at night !,1
i quite enjoy looking at it from the ground .,1
"the upside of the wait was that it was dusk when we got to the top and the views were exquisite , as were the views from the bottom looking up when we descended .",1
"unfortunately , we were not able to go up to the second level for a great view of the city .",1
beautiful at night with lights on .,1
i ca n't imagine visiting france without seeing the eiffel tower .,1
a must visit obviously when in paris .,1
"if you 're tired , you can pause many times .",1
if you go to paris do not miss out on going to the top it is magical .,1
"usually get off the passy station , walk to trocadero and enjoy the scenery from there and then walk down the trocadero gardens to the tower and champ de mars",1
"if you can take the stairs , do so .",1
"before you join a queue check which one is shortest as sometimes the closest ones are far longer that the others ,",1
paris and the eiffel tower ?,1
although we had seen photos all our lives we were unprepared for the actual size of the tower -lrb- especially the base -rrb- .,1
"oh my gosh , its amazing and so so beautiful .",1
then there are the others that ask if your english and try and get you to sign a petition .,1
"if you can manage it , it was the perfect time of day to do it , it was magical at twilight .",1
"that way you can see paris in the day and at night , and night is better !",1
take good care of your valuables and enjoy the view .,1
for the stairs was the queue longer .,1
i recommend buying your tickets in advance so you can skip the lines !,1
went both during the day and at night .,1
"great views , longish waits , got ta do it !",1
"we had reservations at the restaurant on the first floor , so we did n't end up going up separately .",1
we went all the way to the top -lrb- why not ? -rrb-,1
"great place to spend the day in and around , i advice to go up the stairs , is healty more cheap and you get the same if you go by elevator !",1
i enjoyed this sight very much,1
i was there in sept. 2015 for my honeymoon trip .,1
"i pretty relaxed up there despite the crowds which continuously arrived , the one negative which really annoyed me was the overload of ` selfie sticks ' lurking over my shoulder at every turn , really really hated it .",1
this nearly made me freak out .,1
the most visited attraction in the world -- and with good reason .,1
tip - beware of the africans selling you cheap eiffel tower miniatures around .,1
but you must have dinner at the top in the restaurant .,1
unfortunately there were huge queues so we did not climb it but it was very lovely to sit and look at,1
and i have to say the area around the tower was not clean .,1
but you can do this and it 's the cheapest way .,1
make sure you book your reservation at least 3 months in advance .,1
but i do recommend going up and enjoying the wonderful views and history !,1
views wonderful and the fun of the crowds made the experience more enjoyable .,1
life ca n't be much better then this .,1
"the size of this enormous structure will take your breath away , as will the views from the various floors .",1
i text him to say where i was and he did not text back so i started walking down the stairs but he started walking up .,1
our wait to get down was two hours so by the time we got down there were no places still serving dinner so we had to eat snack in our room instead,1
just go with the flow and the experience is incredible .,1
visited eiffel tower on 07/22/2015 .,1
you have to be assertive so you do n't get left behind .,1
"the summit is cool , but the best views are from the second level .",1
i do think though that once you have been up there is no point in doing it again should you revisit .,1
"with 2 small kids , the early start was n't a problem .",1
and believe me i spend 3 days sitting there only .,1
"the tower itself is , of course worth a long long look as it is of course an historic masterpiece .",1
"by the time we were leaving , about an hour or more later , the lines/crowds had grown significantly .",1
the eiffel tower is a one of a kind experience that must be seen .,1
at night this is so gorgeous and catching sight of it in different places around paris is so awe inspiring .,1
we were one block from the eiffel tower so we walked to be there at night .,1
beautiful views from the second floor .,1
the place is usually mobbed .,1
there was a lot of vendors selling souvenirs outside the grounds .,1
we initially visited in 2011 and again in 2016 .,1
they were awestruck .,1
great views from the top and some good memories captured on camera .,1
"obviously , you have to visit this .",1
plan your visit that you get to see both .,1
"we visited the eiffel tower during the morning , the first thing we visited after arriving in paris .",1
"due to rain prediction for the day , we didnt find any queue even on sunday evening .",1
impossible !,1
"took the open tour bus round it , then got off and stood underneath the beast.magnificent and one to remember !",1
overrated .,1
i took a tour of the eiffel tower at night .,1
you will be mesmerized the first time and every time you see it .,1
the structure itself was massive ... but best photo ops for this beauty is from across the streets up by the the trocadero .,1
"lines were not long at all.we got there right at 9am to avoid the rush , i think we were up in less than 35 min .",1
"the structure is amazing , the views are incredible & you can go up & just hang out with a picnic lunch !",1
save your money and go on your own .,1
it is evrything you ever imagined to be .,1
i prefer climbing to the top instead of taking the elevator .,1
would have loved the glass of champagne up there - too cheap to pay 13 euros for it .,1
great views of paris from second level with a couple of gift shops if you need a momento .,1
climbing the stairs gives an up close look at the structural details,1
a fab experience but the queues were way too long .,1
the staff is very slow with just a couple of ticket counters working .,1
i booked a `` tour '' with viator with a preferred admission which save us a lot of time in the lines and basically walk straight to the elevator to take us to the second floor .,1
she chased them and the girl threw the purse but it was empty .,1
visited twice .,1
"you do have the option to go up to the 1st level , then again to the 2nd level by stairs , but you have to take their lift up to get all the way up top .",1
this is myself and my husbands 4th visit to this beautiful city .,1
"extra bag check in force now and lots of security checks , so be careful what you carry for a picnic .",1
"pretty soon , i was taking tons of pictures !",1
"we were lucky , we got a clear day so stunning views of the city !",1
security was heightened whilst we was there but did n't really spoil anything .,1
went there with my wife for a day and night trip .,1
very surprised at the long serpentine que to be admitted to the grounds .,1
obviously a must if you 're visiting paris .,1
"we did n't actually ascend , so my review is based solely on going to the site -lrb- you have to see the eiffel tower if you are in paris ! -rrb-",1
go with a fisheye to get best shots !,1
pre booked tickets for 3pm .,1
when you get there and leave be careful to not get trapped in the tourist areas .,1
the view from the top was amazing !,1
finally we go up to 2nd floor at eiffel tower .,1
it is advisable to visit there either in the early morning or on weekdays to avoid rush ; we waited long to go to the top,1
"highly recommend seeing it at night and day for the north west and south east , give very different perspectives of it",1
if you are in paris you must go to the tower .,1
"once you get through the inefficient process of buying tickets and lining up for the elevators , the pleasure begins .",1
did not walk up or take the elevator to the top because of the long lines .,1
"i had been before , but it is always a stunning view .",1
i always love to start my trip by seeing the eiffel tower at night and come back to see it in the morning .,1
i have also been to the top which is really neat !,1
we went in the evening as i think it is a must !,1
city bus tours can get you here or by public transportation must see day and night ... night even from a distance is beautiful !,1
my daughter just loved the sheer size of it and the fact that it looked so ` awesome ' -lrb- in her words ! -rrb-,1
"first of all , walk up to it from a few blocks away .",1
amazing view from the top .,1
i would 100 % recommend the online reservation .,1
guide adam was great and offered friendly and informative about the tower and tourist attractions in paris .,1
paid the extra 6 euro and waited 25 minutes to go to the top .,1
amazing view from the top of the tower .,1
"whether for the first time or not the first , it is always great fun and affords a great view to boot .",1
it is beautiful ... .,1
this is to be done !,1
"the architect is amazing and it 's so big , you have to experience it in person .",1
"great view from the top , or even half way up .",1
was n't the best time to go up but the queues were almost non existent .,1
: -rrb- we liked the relaxed atmosphere .,1
it 's like magic !,1
bought tickets for the lift and summit on line so did n't have to wait in line .,1
we went up the tower in the evening and seeing the city at night was beautiful .,1
we were lucky to be able to get last minute tickets to go all the way to the top .,1
"but what i like the most , is to climb it near the sunset , when you can enjoy the `` city of lights '' lighting-up !!!",1
went to the top and the views were spectacular -lrb- many photos taken -rrb- and you can see where gustave eiffel had his office !,1
"a unique place where you can spend a lot of time just enjoyning the environment , the tower and everything around .",1
the queues can be substantial .,1
do not miss it on a clear day it is just superb and you can also use the restaurants .,1
hated the guys touting trash souvenirs and being really pushy on the walk from the station .,1
the only complaint i have is the fact that you have to deal with all the hawkers selling junk-and they are quite persistent !,1
buy a city pass and get a reservation to skip the long lines .,1
the iconic tower is absolutely incredible at night as the tower glistens !!!!,1
learn from my mistakes folks !,1
the summit offers fantastic views of the entire city .,1
"putting the cost to one side , you simply ca n't visit paris and not meet the well know landmark ...",1
the fast pass tickets are really helpful .,1
it really magnificent building in france and place to fall in love all over again .,1
"it was awsome , seeing it on tv does n't do it justice , just massive and the food in the restaurant was fantastic , what a day and what an amazing city .",1
"but for about $ 45 per person , you can buy a ` skip the line ' ticket , which puts you on level two in about 15 minutes , with an additional 30 minutes or so to get on the center elevator to the top .",1
"i 'm not sure what 's normal , but the lines to go up in the elevator were about 2 hours long on saturday morning .",1
visiting the eiffel tower bears the same weight and interest as does the statue of liberty in new york,1
one of lovely great place in the world .,1
it 's really big - bigger than i anticipated .,1
get there early or prepare to wait for hours .,1
"great views of paris and a definite recommendation , take the ticket all the way to the top for amazing views of paris both day and night .",1
we stayed near the eiffel tower so i had a chance to view it each day .,1
amazing must visit if you are in paris up top has some amazing views and i would visit again if am ever in paris sami,1
everybody should visit this at least once in their life .,1
one of great icons of the world .,1
it is a great place to go and experience the beauty in real .,1
my 16 year old loved the eiffel tower .,1
"however , once i was around the area , i changed my opinion .",1
what can be said about the eiffel tower that has not already been said ?,1
still i would not miss this .,1
just a better blackpool tower .,1
there we witnessed a man drop to 1 knee and propose to his girl friend - true french romance !,1
i think it is mandatory to see the eiffel tower when in paris .,1
not particularly busy and got a seat with a view easily .,1
"another surprise and a welcome one , is that they seem to have cleared away the majority of the street sellers who use to be at the base of the tower , makes it a much more pleasant experience not being hounded to buy things constantly .",1
we have had a short break in paris and the eiffel tower was on the top of the to-do list of course .,1
but the security is poor .,1
get here early to avoid the queues and go all the way to the top for fantastic views .,1
had a quick visit to paris with my son & we decided to visit the wonderful eiffel tower .,1
my son was being very patient .,1
"if you do n't want o wait in line , you can find a company that provide a private tour and skip the line .",1
not for the faint hearted as it is several hundred steps up and then down again and it is a spiral staircase going up the inside of the tower .,1
"in our case , the advanced tickets on line were sold out on the dates we wanted to go so we joined a local tour that provided entrance tickets including summit floor access along with a tour guide .",1
well ... .,1
i have visited many other cities across the world and none were so un-cared for .,1
also view it from a river cruise on the seine and from arc de triomphe for unique views and photo opportunities .,1
we went down to see the light show at dark ... it was beautiful .,1
however it is not as organized and secure as you would expect .,1
consider only going to the second level and save yourself some money and time .,1
"it is crowded , it is best to buy a ticket online before you get there & it is best to buy a skip the line pass to get you up sooner .",1
the structure itself is amazing in person - it looks so beautiful at night all light up especially when it starts twinkling .,1
book tickets before you go like we did so you beat the queues .,1
"we hopped on a bus and alighted at ecole militaire just for fun , which meant we were right at the base of the gardens leaving up to the tour eiffel .",1
on our first trip to paris we had to make the eiffel tower one of our first stops .,1
"if you are interested in the view , the second level is fine enough to see all of paris city .",1
even water bottles are not allowed inside .,1
i was taken as a birthday surprise and it was so beautiful .,1
the city is well lit up so you do not miss any great views or attractions .,1
the beauty was so much that i was moved to tears .,1
we were very pleasantly surprised with the included meal .,1
go back during the day and climb the stairs for a wonderful view of the structure itself .,1
the cafes below the tower were all gone and armed police and army patrol regularly .,1
17 euros ticket to the top is great value .,1
completely different to my trip 10 years ago .,1
iconic building is an art and précis !,1
"big emotion , we had fun .",1
that itself is worth it so make sure you time your visit so that you will be standing in front of it at the top of the hour at night .,1
"a must to do in paris , lines very long so go with a group or pay for priority timed access .",1
"the view is incredible , the structure itself is amazing and being able to do and see so much from it is great !",1
the eiffel tower is amazing and ca n't be missed when visiting paris .,1
"coming from toronto -lrb- cn tower -rrb- , i was n't sure i 'd be impressed with the eiffel tower .",1
visited paris over christmas and the apartment had a view of the eiffel tower which magically sparkles on the hour so was glorious to watch .,1
"if you go in the winter time , dont go on a foggy day because if you go to the top which costs 17 euros per person , you wont be able to see anything at all and will waste your money .",1
"be sure to make time to see the eiffel tower , whether its just to stroll the area under and around it or to purchase tickets to go up a flight or two .",1
our group of 15 met our guide at a little souvenir shop near the tower .,1
"eiffel tower is very good , we get engrossed in the beauty and experience of tower and their are many petty thieves running in this area , they will target your bag and wallet , they are too fast , we lost our laptop bag having all passport of our group to a thieve and were very disappointed by the security arrangements , police was not available and when we reached police station they were least interested in searching for our bag and person who had picked it up in spite of having his photo .",1
"but i prefer the night view , on the hour , when the `` sparkle '' lights illuminate .",1
it 's worth the journey - read about it before you visit to appreciate the times of its construction .,1
it 's a must visit in paris !,1
i 'd also recommend downloading the eiffel tower app so you can enjoy the history and highlights of what your are looking at as your visit each side of the tower .,1
"he made his name with various bridges for the french railway network , most famous the garabit viaduct .",1
still awesome to see .,1
"it was cold up there in february , so wrap up warm , as it 's completely exposed .",1
so exciting to see in person after viewing it in media over a lifetime .,1
the views at both levels are absolutely astounding .,1
parisian architecture in every direction .,1
"one warning would be to watch out for the con artists on the route to the tower , playing a game with cups and a ball , they are clearly a large number of males and females working together to get money from tourist .",1
waiting in a que to get up for more than 2 hours .,1
"the eiffel tower is a beautiful sight , especially at 8pm when it is lit up for the night .",1
the guided tour avoids the hassles of standing in long ques sometimes two hours .,1
"security was high , but i was pleased about this .",1
made our way down by elevator to the first level -lrb- you can walk if you like -rrb- before heading back to the base of the tower .,1
"in my opinion , it 's best viewed from all angles , but not necessary to stand in line , pay money , and go up .",1
made it to the top of the tower with moments to spare before it shut for the evening .,1
we bought our tickets online about a month before our arrival .,1
it is not necessary be a athlete to accomplish the task .,1
then change lifts to go to the top .,1
"however , my daughters wanted to see the view from the top so we crammed into the elevator and joined the crowd .",1
only disappointment was the poor state of the surrounding gardens .,1
the lines are long and the monetary expense is not worth it .,1
we did a small tour which was well worth the money -lrb- $ 50 us -rrb- .,1
how can anyone visit paris without stopping here ?,1
"if you like views , there are better spots in paris , where you can go - to save money , time and your nerves .",1
"please book the tickets online , it saves heaps of time .",1
do n't make the mistake of queueing in the ` reserved tickets ' line -lrb- which is signposted in green -rrb- unless you have tickets .,1
a must see and do in paris .,1
then the queue to the lift another 45 minutes .,1
"the eiffel tower is just as you would imagine , captivating and quite breathtaking from below and offering amazing views from the top .",1
went to the eiffel tower at dusk and at midday on two separate occasions .,1
slightly surprising it was very crowded despite cold weather .,1
you can see most of the paris city from there .,1
what a great landmark .,1
better to take your photo from trocodero .,1
"once you get up there , though , the views of paris are absolutely breathtaking .",1
the views from top anre images i shall carry and cherish in my head for the rest of my life !,1
stand beneath the eiffel tower and contemplate how audacious an undertaking this was beginning in 1887 as europe was just recovering from the long depression that lasted for most of the 1870s .,1
i could not find any tickets online - they were all taken for weeks ahead .,1
i was surprised not to find any queues at all around 6 p.m. on monday .,1
book tickets online with fixed date and time - and be lucky not to spend time in the line .,1
"i saw the eiffel tower from so many different and angles and distances and views , and it was mesmerising each time .",1
the views as the sun went down were just amazing .,1
"if you go there , it is 2h before going up and there are queues up there waiting for you .",1
"during day , you can go upto 3 level of eiffel tower via lift n of course its chargeable .",1
i walked up to the second stage which takes about 20 minutes if you take it easy .,1
my advice is to wait till the sun set to see the tower during the night when its lighted .,1
huge line for the one lift and all the stairs to go down were closed !,1
"well , only to be around it its very nice .",1
"it was beautiful yes , but it honestly could have been any major city if it were n't for the old structures .",1
beware of scam artists -lrb- not the portrait artists -rrb- and pick pockets though .,1
this really is one of the wonders of paris with the great palace .,1
la tour eiffel is the centrepiece of any visit to paris .,1
"been there , done that .",1
"we made it to the second deck , had some celebratory drinks , visited the gift shop and made the climb down .",1
some of our number had never been to france before so this was a rather special event and what more iconic a location could have been chosen .,1
worth the price not having to wait in line .,1
"security is excellent , but takes a little time .",1
do climb up the stairs to really get hold of the construction and to fully understand what a mecanical miracle this is .,1
the eiffel tower offers an amazing view of paris .,1
my most favourite attraction in paris,1
truly magical !,1
there was no line at the midway point and we went directly to the upper elevator without delay .,1
i would recommend going on a weekday -lrb- we were there on a saturday and a monday ; saturday was nuts -rrb- because the lines for walking up were nonexistent in the morning .,1
"but if you do , you save between 40 and 75 minutes waiting time .",1
"-lrb- at this point , you will have already experienced this if you 've been in paris for more than a few hours -rrb- but it 's an incredible experience .",1
it was a very long wait -lrb- 1.5 hours -rrb- to get to the ticket counter .,1
went on a clear morning and the view was amazing the only thing that surprises me it was the only place we visited that charged children everywhere else allows children in free but still worth the money,1
"however , it was windy and chilly that day and i forgot to take my heavier coat so that was the only downside to me .",1
the walk down the,1
kids will love it .,1
here for a few days with our adult children and just had to go up the tower .,1
great photo ops and views - landscape and architecturally of the tower itself .,1
"unfortunately , it 's winter time and they did n't open the submit of the tower so we went only until the second level .",1
"loved seeing this famous tower , especially at night , so beautiful with the lights .",1
the queues for the stairs were much longer .,1
"it 's a lovely lovely sight , bringing lovely lovely memories .",1
"my boyfriend and i were in paris , in may 2015 , and the weather was perfect .",1
stick around at the top until sunset if you can !,1
the view from the summit of the eiffel tower at night is simply beautiful and breathtaking .,1
the lift brought us right up to the top observation deck .,1
", beautifull view and perfect place , with a crowed of thousands of people , habad arranged a hanuka candles light was very very excited",1
"do n't take lots of bags or cases , they might not let you through and there really is n't enough room .",1
it was a great sight day & night !,1
"we were then taken , again past all queue !",1
this a great place to be .,1
it is a global landmark and a a must visit while in paris .,1
level 2 gives amazing views .,1
enjoyed every minute of the eiffel tower visit .,1
"the tower is lit up nightly at dusk , on the top of the hour , with a magnificent light show .",1
a trip to paris and not going up the eiffel tower is almost sacrilege .,1
tickets online are sold out months in advance .,1
at daytime we were able to enjoy the spectacular views of paris and at nightime we were able to enjoy the light show .,1
"we were unable to get tickets to go up the eiffel tower , but enjoyed visiting this iconic landmark .",1
there is nothing like it and you can not appreciate the engineering until you enter it .,1
but it 's deserve to waiting .,1
"solely must experience whenever you visit paris , you just ca n't miss the eiffel towers , it 's worth every minute queuing to get to the top and enjoy the priceless views of paris , i love it , the only drawback is the area around the eiffel tower is unfriendly , watch your wallets and bags , cameras etc. unfortunately its notorious for crime .",1
"overall , it is makes for a beautiful stop during your visit to paris .",1
we also got to speak with other people in line and that passed the time away .,1
"we 've all seen a million pictures of this , but pictures do not do it justice .",1
lots of people selling cheap eiffel tower souvenirs made in china .,1
an architectural marvel that can be seen from miles around .,1
the top of the tower gives an amazing view .,1
"lot 's of people selling you smaller statues which look exactly like the tall thing , if you 're in the market for such an object you should seriously consider buying one .",1
it 's cheaper to take the stairs -lrb- 5 $ -rrb- and the is seldom a very long line .,1
make sure you visit the eiffel both day & night .,1
"ok it 's easy to say , the tower is unique in the world and because of this an excellent status .",1
we walked over here from some art museums .,1
walk up and walk back down its much quicker if you have n't booked and are short of time .,1
wonderful once in a lifetime place to visit .,1
unfortunately today it rained and my family did not get to enjoy what i have seen .,1
"very reasonable and an awesome experience lines moved quickly and the view was to die for , enjoyable experiance",1
they take credit cards but make sure you have a card with a chip .,1
"i was disappointed in that when i purchased the paris pass i thought this was included , but it was not .",1
i never made it to the top .,1
looking forward to my next visit .,1
enjoyed some amazing top time and then back down for some second floor time and down to the bottom within 2 hours to make our dinner reservation .,1
"be aware of the pick-pockets , touts and hundreds of guys waiting to ripoff your hard-earned money in whatever way they can ... carry your fluids and food , not great options close to it , and whatever is there is n't good value for the money .",1
it was very very beautiful to see the eiffel all lit up beautifully .,1
"if you do n't wish to spend a considerable amount of time queuing to go up the tower , i would suggest that you arrive early round 50mins before opening .",1
a lot of people arrive there everyday but is really organized and in some minutes you must be on the top of the tower .,1
"to best way to approach it is by trocadero , across the river .",1
toilets have security guards on .,1
"i probably would n't bother going again if i was to be back in paris again , it 's kind of one of those things once you have done it once you do n't really need to go again .",1
also the restrooms for the base area are found on a lower level with stairs -lrb- there must be a handicapped restroom but i do n't know how to access it -rrb- .,1
"not fun to stand in the very long lines with kids , so do yourself a favor .",1
the city view at night from the top was beautiful !,1
they would not sell us third level tickets from the ground because the top was too crowded .,1
then comes the transparent elevator which carries probably 40-50 tourist at a time to the 1st floor -lrb- note : a general entry ticket has entry to 1st floor only -rrb- .,1
we queued for 40 minutes initially to get our tickets but once that wait was over it was all a go from there .,1
"i felt i wanted to look at it , not from it .",1
we bought two tickets to go to 2nd floor .,1
"for anybody that has a problem with crowds i would say , do n't even try the eiffel tower but we enjoyed the experience but would not bother again .",1
worth the wait and the security people were there to protect us so we did not mind .,1
"with bertrand , we got to the top of the eiffel tower without waiting .",1
view from the top is to die for whether it be day or night .,1
the view is fantastic and lift prices are very reasonable .,1
i am so glad we went .,1
i visited the place with some friends it was very good trip but full of hawkers around .,1
kept all the vendors outside so you can walk around and really enjoy it inside the fence without worrying about the vendors bothering you every two seconds .,1
i came here when i was younger and loved it so decided to return whilst in paris on a business trip .,1
took a guided tour which was lovely and visited the first floor too .,1
"i travelled with my sister who was a little bit scared about the height , but it was ok at the top as it 's more enclosed , so you feel safer .",1
"i dont know why i loved it so much , but i did .",1
such a cliche i know but i just love visiting the eiffel tower when in paris !,1
the most beautiful thing we have ever seen .,1
"i have always thought that it might be overrated , but standing there at trocadero and walking to it changes that thought .",1
i ordered two and had to pay with a 50 $ note .,1
i ca n't believe this is a first world country .,1
"a must see if you visit paris , but the biggest tip would be to book online to avoid the queues .",1
looking at the sheer engineering of this giant and the fact it was constructed in just over 2 years is mind boggling .,1
score .,1
you need to be careful for longer queue .,1
there are a lot of street peddlers and one would not take no for an answer .,1
we left our tickets back at the hotel and there was no time to go back and get them .,1
only negatives are the crowds & the `` hawkers '' selling trinkets .,1
took my family to see the tower in all its glory .,1
do pre-book your tickets as it saves a lot of time from waiting in long winding queues .,1
i did n't continue to the top because even at 7:30 pm the line ups were still horrendous .,1
i was glad we were walking down .,1
"we are supposed to receive a refund on the tickets , still waiting to see if it shows up on my credit card statement .",1
it is a must-see in paris .,1
after reading reviews on tripadvisor we got here for 9am and there was already quite a queue .,1
"one because it 's more than 200,000 people at one spot and two because all access to transport within a 1 km radius from eiffel tower is closed .",1
france 's main attraction .,1
ticket line can be very long !,1
"enchanting thing to do if visiting paris , restaurant is on the first floor which still gives you a beautiful view .",1
there 's a very expensive restaurant at the top that you have to book at least months in advance .,1
"this grand structure still dominates paris 127 years after its creation , but you must do more than look at it from afar .",1
when you 're used to seeing pretty lit up pictures of la tour eiffel .,1
do n't forget to see it all lit up at night .,1
we bought a ticket on the 2nd level to get to the top .,1
"great view of paris , but you may want to try the montparnasse tower for a view with the tower in .",1
"while the structure itself is impressive , the view is incredible .",1
and wish we did n't have such a long line in the stairwalk from the south tower .,1
i highly recommend the bus tour which has headsets explaining the areas .,1
last minute trip to paris would n't have been complete without a trip to the eiffel tower !,1
go at sunset and enjoy !,1
took a tour with city wonder tours .,1
shame it was cloudy and foggy on the day !,1
"we visited the tower last year and it had its problems then , but this year it is worse by a large margin .",1
it will cost 17 euros to go to the top of the tower and about 11 euros to go to the second floor .,1
we went on a sunny sunday .,1
"it was exciting , with great views of the city , perhaps a bit crowded .",1
it is really high and scary but once you are up it is beautiful .,1
we were advised to be there to see it efore the hour as it lights up for about 2 mins only every hour - sparkling/trickling lights up and down this wonderful french landmark .,1
big bus was a good option for the city tour .,1
just gorgeous views .,1
my wife did n't realise she did n't have a head for heights until we went up here .,1
i only went up to the second floor but the view there was good enough .,1
not good if you want to go up the tower as queues are horrendous for the one and only lift,1
only queued for a short while and the tickets were reasonably priced .,1
the views were amazing & at night was spectacular with the tower lit up .,1
"eiffel tower , as they call it , is a mere iron structure to me .",1
it 's all good here only thing is when people approach you to buy things just say `` merci nou . '',1
there were too many pushy street vendors .,1
"we booked in advance for the elevator , good choice in the end :-rrb- but they take you straigtht to the top first where a glass of champain costs like $ 13 for 10cl .",1
"had we not booked in 58 tour eiffel restaurant , i think just seeing the tower from afar would have been enough for me .",1
our food was ok -- really you come for the experience and the view -- the luxury and really expensive restaurant is the jules verne -- but expect to pay 150-200 euro per person -- now that was excellent - but pricey .,1
just ignore them as they are also on the lookout for security and will leave when they become aware of approaching security .,1
take the elevator up and walk down the stairs to appreciate the engineering of the structure .,1
it was lit up for the evening was just stunning .,1
"14.50 euro to go to the top , free ice skating on the first floor , not too much of a que -lrb- wednesday -rrb- amazing light show , and in a great area .",1
once in an hour the twinking lights starts and stays for few mins which looks just out of the world ... a must see monument ...,1
it is an amazing piece of architecture and you really benefit from understanding the background .,1
we had pre booked online so just had to turn up to the tower at the applied time .,1
only the one ` leg ' was open on the afternoon of our visit .,1
"do n't matter if is raining , snowing or a sunny day ... eiffel tower is like a dream come true and you will have an experience that you never had before .",1
for some reason i expected it to be reddish in colour and not the bland pale colour now .,1
"although we were n't able to enter to the tower , the view in the night from outside is marvelous and in the day you can go to trocadero and get some nice pictures",1
ideally one should do both .,1
"the views just get better and better the higher you climb , from the first viewing deck with its bars to the 3rd viewing deck all the way at the top !",1
but queues are long .,1
"after 1.5 hours , the booth opened and we bought our tickets .",1
could n't see anything at the summit .,1
we got in line at 830 in the morning ... the ticket office opened at 9:30 .,1
we 'll always be back again !,1
"to many -lrb- tourists -rrb- , this is a must-see .",1
"the next day we went back and enjoyed the tower in the sunshine , and the lights at night / !!!",1
"other than that , it 's a beautiful sight .",1
the kids really enjoyed .,1
it was good to learn of the history and controversy about the building of the tower .,1
make sure you buy tickets online before you arrive to avoid queues !,1
reserve ahead of time to skip 2-hour wait .,1
and it 's particularly beautiful when lit .,1
"in fact , it is almost always visible when walking around the city .",1
"what a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere , overlooking this magnificent city !!",1
we were warned many time about pick pockets .,1
"walk , do not take the lift if you want the full experience .",1
it would be best to purchase the fast track pass to avoid the lines .,1
"my son decided that we would climb the steps , all 760 of them , it was a great experience and thoroughly enjoyable , laughing all the way , we took our time and rested a good few times .",1
as we all know that this tower is one of the most famous tower on earth .,1
you can ride up to the very top but the wait is 3.30 hours so make sure you have time .,1
great place for photo 's any time .,1
it 's a must see !!,1
liked the breath taking views from the very top .,1
my biggest surprise was that it 's brown .,1
be vigilant as its a haven for pickpockets though we had no trouble at all .,1
fois gras terrine and bulgar salad etc. the ascend up from the restaurant lets you climb just up to the second floor .,1
i could n't believe we would have to wait 30 minutes or more .,1
"worth spending a few minutes looking at , and probably worth going up , but we did n't bother .",1
"whatever you do if you can afford to get a queue-jump ticket , do .",1
"if you go to paris , and you do not go to the top of the eiffel tower , your parisian experience will be incomplete .",1
we wanted to go the summit and i could not find tickets anywhere because they were sold out .,1
"also , the line took about 45 minutes .",1
the grounds around it are thoughtfully planned out .,1
"there are several tours to choose from , but it worth the line skip and tour guide was quite animated and informative .",1
paris view from top in night is amazing .,1
you will also be searched before entering the restroom area .,1
"it was nice , and the view was pretty .",1
we happened to time this visit just perfectly as we saw the city change from dusk to night .,1
was here in end of march at almost 10 pm and was treated to an amazing light show by the tower .,1
no description is enough to descrive the romance and beauty and atmosphere you can experience !!,1
we had a wonderful visit to the eiffel tower .,1
paid $ 17 for the summit ride which was great .,1
this really is a sight to behold .,1
if you ca n't afford lunch in the eiffel tower you can eat at one of the many a local bakeries or delis nearby .,1
highly recommend to visit each and every time in paris !,1
"a must go , and definitely , if the weather is not that bad , it ´ s worth the wait to the very top of the eiffel .",1
"we had tickets with a time slot to avoid long queues , disappointingly it was so foggy that day that we could n't get good views from the top .",1
this would 've left us in line for hours .,1
that was brilliant .,1
definitely a must see and do for anyone going to paris .,1
"also , you have to go through long lines before you can go up .",1
might be different during day light hours or when the weather is warmer .,1
amazing place thought the ticket i bought was nin refundable and missed the appointment coz of delayed flight still manage to get the view day and night.if you book it on line its cheaper but make sure you give a day after tou arrived in case of flight delays they wont consider of refunding tickets not even let you in once you missed the appointment .,1
maybe .,1
eiffel tower is simply impressive with it 's structure .,1
is sad but required .,1
i would always pack a picnic and sit in the park at sundown to see the lights turn on .,1
it is magical and the quintessential paris experience - on a budget !,1
this experience was included in our tour .,1
12 - 24 year olds are charged at a lower rate .,1
reserve at the restaurant few days before,1
seeing it for the first time is awe-inspiring .,1
i went right up to the summit level but it was too foggy to see all of paris but i had to go up .,1
beautiful fountains and perfectly kept landscaping surrounding the tower .,1
"scine my childhood visiting the eiffel tower has been one of my dreams , today after getting off the brussels tarsin and using the paris subway and changing once firection i could achieve one of my eldest dreams and i could finally seed that , it was there , the eiffel tower , and im so happy .",1
however there are a lot of dodgy looking people hanging around so i recommend watching your stuff especially as you 're taking photos .,1
best experience ever .,1
took the stairs down to the first floor but not keen on heights so would not do that again and take the lift !,1
"great value for money , go to the summet if you dare .",1
you have to pay a little to use the second lift but it 's well worth it .,1
went to the eiffel tower just to walk around .,1
my tip for traveller is you need reserve time for this so try to see in day time and see in nighttime both time this engineering structure give you great pleasure,1
no need to say more about what is already the most famous and iconic monument in the world .,1
back then you could just go up and walk right under the eiffel tower .,1
we prebooked tickets directly through the eiffel tower website for lift access to the second floor for 11 euros each which i thought was pretty reasonable .,1
"wow doesnt even describe it , it embodies everything that is beautiful is paris .",1
"but it is a beautiful piece of architecture and well worth a visit , unfortunately we did n't get to the top as it was 30 degrees and a hour long wait for tickets so i 'd suggest booking in advance !",1
"there was a line to buy the tickets , then a line to get onto the elevator for the first level , another line for the second level , then the same to come back down ... bottom line is , expect a couple of hours of just standing in line !",1
"so beautiful love this place good for family , couple and friends .",1
it 's also not that expensive to go inside .,1
where you can get to witness its famous light show .,1
much quicker to just walk up to level 2 and then there was a 45 minute wait for the elevator to the top .,1
you ca n't really miss it no matter where you are in the city .,1
i have only seen the eiffel tower and not actually climbed it .,1
me & friend only paid the cheapest one which is $ 7.00 where we have to walk our way up the stairs -lrb- the cheapest and less queue -rrb- .,1
i was glad to be on the ground again & tick this off my bucket list !,1
i was amazed .,1
i would see again next time dinner,1
we were able to walk up to the front of the line during our specific tour time .,1
is .,1
"being french , i highly recommend climbing the stairs instead of taking the elevator , it 's cheaper and actually faster because you have no line !",1
"the ticket sales people were so lovely , the prices are reasonable , and the people who took you through security were friendly and helpful .",1
visited during the day and got skip the queue which was a bonus but absolutely stunning at night when it lights up on the hour every hour .,1
just a quick security check and we were at the ticket office .,1
we went at dusk and stayed for the lights to come on-truly magical !,1
visit during the day by all means get there early security is tight if you have any liquids with you drink theese first as you wo n't be allowed in with them do n't forget to return to see it at night it is wonderful .,1
this is such a shame .,1
yes !,1
if you are in good health condition and want to do something memorable i prefer to opt for going second level of eiffel by stairs as i did .,1
"we queued up for hours to reach the summit , but worth to visit specially at nite time , we wont forget the amazing view .",1
"as usual we went like other visitors to visit the iconic places , the tower itself is set up in a very nice location by the river .",1
the weather that day was in the 70 's but it 's chilly and windy when you 're up that high .,1
much much shorter !,1
eiffel tower gives you real feel that you are in paris .,1
"and really , can you say that you have visited paris without going up in the eiffel tower ?",1
mostly though it 's an overrated viewing platform .,1
the greens in front of the eiffel tower was nice .,1
"while walking through a neighborhood you ca n't really see the tower , and then suddenly it 's just there with a lovely park below it .",1
how could you not visit eiffel tower while you are in paris ... what 's breathtaking view from middle level of eiffel tower .,1
"it may seem a little cookie-cutter if you 're not into mainstream stuff , but it 's definitely worth seeing .",1
the view is spectacular in allowing a 360 view of the city .,1
it is definitely masterpiece of architectural site .,1
"my husband and i agree that the tower is beautiful , majestic and photogenic from a distance .",1
"plenty of restaurants with views of this , great to sit down and have a glass of wine !",1
they should be barred from the surrounds of the tower as they spoil the overall experience,1
"had lunch at restaurant on 1st level - take elevator , but you will be waiting in line - watch your valuables - pick pockets and gypsy children will annoy you - politely ignore them - you have to see the eiffel tower if in paris",1
"we went during the day -lrb- without going up -rrb- and walked around the grounds , to the park etc. .",1
what else is there to say ?,1
"one can also use rer c and get off at champ - de - mars , which is the closest to tour eiffel entrance , keep in mind this is a 10 - 15 min walk , thus you should get to this spot atleast 20 mins before your tour timing .",1
"love the experience of this iconic tower lively , here is ehatvi notices , i live france , i do n't appreciated , there was the staff members wiht nastt actitud trying to ruine my experience on this monument , i spend my savings to visit you beutyful country , but instead i get you actitud becouse i do n't speak french , all the time i ask in ingles they replay in french and i honestly do n't understand but clearly you guys did if you do t luke to deal with tourists change you job , hope some manager send secret shoppers to understand how frustrating it is , next time i will practice some french",1
"once at the top there are actually a couple different levels to see , plus of course , gift shops and eateries .",1
we also watched it sparkle - it glitters every hour .,1
"we stopped briefly on the 1st stage to take in the views/glass floor and for a bottle of water , which was suprisingly cheap .",1
every visit to paris i try to take a walk or run around the eiffel and the gardens .,1
rain disappointed me a bit .,1
"it 's a must of course , if you have time try and stay up the tower until darkness , the views day and night are stunning .",1
best time to go is out of season cost to go up 11 euros per adult .,1
so if you the type of person who plans ahead - do so .,1
"but , highly recommend to get a brilliant view of paris !",1
although the rink is small it is fun .,1
great view of paris from the tower .,1
the structure is not only one of the most symbolic landmarks but is perhaps the most popular architectural achievement in the world .,1
the eiffel tower is one of the most famous places of paris .,1
i would definately reccommend the effile tower to anyone who visits paris !,1
be sure to get tickets that include a trip to the -lrb- top -rrb- summit .,1
"i saw the tower twinkle up close at night , spectacular .",1
you have to get another lift to summit which does take longer .,1
"however , we stood in line and eventually got in .",1
by the time we got to the ticket booth they had closed the very top platform because it was too full .,1
one downside the about eiffel tower is that public restrooms in the park below there are not maintained at all and very dirty .,1
it 's a pity .,1
"view was ok , but not a must .",1
specially evening when lights are on .,1
"it 's always nice to see it from different places in the city , by day or by night .",1
we had `` pre-booked '' our visit before leaving and unfortunately it was raining the day we went .,1
we only added paris to our trip due to eiffel and it was the best decision .,1
you can not go to paris and not visit this attraction .,1
a must see & do while in paris .,1
we went at night and the view from the second level was incredible .,1
"if you arrive after the opening be prepared for a long , long wait to go up .",1
otherwise get there at 8:30 am to get in line .,1
been up the eiffel tower a number of times before since first coming to paris as a school child,1
"but we were on the top on a rainy day , it is probably much better on a clear , sunny day .",1
this was my fifth or sixth trip to the eiffel tower and it never get 's old .,1
worth a visit if you are in paris .,1
"yes , it 's a cliche .",1
the best photo ops are at the top of trocadero !,1
fortunately we had pre booked dinner to avoid the queues and we were ushered up to the towers dining platform within a few minutes of our arrival .,1
must visit !!!!,1
saw fantastic views over the city but be prepared for some very rude people who are totally unaware of people around them .,1
the eiffel tower is gorgeous at night .,1
"looks nicer in the reality , but the view form the top might not be worth all the queuing .",1
"whipped around the tower 360 -lrb- three times over two days -rrb- took great photos , avoided the lines , the hoards , the poachers , the cops chasing the poachers ... basically the madness .",1
must watch if you are in paris .,1
"there are shops , cafés and toilets on 2nd floor so do n't be worried about being caught short , so to speak .",1
the eiffel tower is worth a visit at least once .,1
it 's a paris `` must '' .,1
the eiffel tower was lit up and the view was amazing .,1
i 've been to paris multiple times and i 've been up at the tower at least 3 times and every time there is always something that surprises or delights me .,1
a must do !!!!!,1
"if you can , maybe join a tour like city wonders - because they have separate entrances and can get in faster .",1
you realize how tiny you are while standing beneath the eiffel tower ... needs no further introduction .,1
"be patient , you will have to line up to take the elevator to the top level .",1
this by far was our favourite part of europe .,1
cost was reasonable -lrb- about 8 euro or so -rrb- .,1
everyone knows that the eiffel tower is a must-see !,1
this applies to all three levels .,1
"if like us you decide you have to go up the tower , just allow time .",1
we enjoyed the two deck guided tour and had a snack at the snack bar on the second level .,1
everyone should go to paris at least once in their life .,1
"visiting the eiffel tower as a couple , we opted to take the lift all the way to the top .",1
the eiffel tower is an amazing feat .,1
the light show come out on the hour every hour at night and should not be missed .,1
probably the most beautiful place in paris .,1
you 're crazy not to go !,1
perhaps that 's because we went via trocadero plaza .,1
the eiffel tower has three floors in total .,1
a visit to the eiffel is compulsory both at day and night if in paris .,1
paris is a magical city full of amazing things to experience and i think one of the most exhilarating experience is the eiffel tower .,1
definitely not going to miss it .,1
"instead , we wandered around the river and the site and as sunset neared , we spread our blanket on the grass just in front of the tower ... .",1
"even though it 's the same view , it 's a totally different experience !",1
wonderful views from the 2nd story of the tower .,1
closed because of a union strike ... fortunately you can enjoy the eiffeltoren from a very far distance -lrb- lol -rrb- ... if you go to the galerie lafayette you can to the upper balcony to have a great view on this monument .,1
30yr on and a visit to the top of the eiffel tower never ceases to amaze .,1
a true highlight of our trip .,1
who was a french civil engineer and architect .,1
we used skip the line tickets to go to the second level then purchase tickets for the summit .,1
"if you plan to go to the top of the tower , please make sure you go early in the morning so that you do n't have to spend hours just to queue especially if you travel with kids .",1
best to make the visit first thing in the morning before the crowds arrive .,1
this is one impressive building .,1
there is a lot of security to get through here - i lost count of how many times my bag was searched here .,1
our tour guide was very informative .,1
it 's just one of the most iconic monuments of the world .,1
the que to go up the tower are quite long especially in peak times but it would be worth the wait to go up it .,1
"# 1 place to visit on your list , right ?",1
i suggest you cross the bridge -lrb- pont d'lena -rrb- and take a photo from jardins du trocadero for an awesome shot .,1
i ended up reserving for the wrong dates online and bought a new set of tickets that day because mine we not valid .,1
but lots pics etc can be taking from down below .,1
what would a visit to paris be without pictures of this symbol of france .,1
"and , forget what you hear - go to the summit .",1
how wrong could we be !,1
if you want to ride up the tower please book early .,1
giving ourselves plenty of time or so we thought .,1
why are you even thinking of not visiting ?,1
i suggest to visit after the sunset .,1
"the first time i went to the eiffel tower was in 2003 , long before there was an option to book in advance .",1
we only saw it early in the morning and do n't get me wrong we loved the view and the pictures we took but wished we had come back at some point on our vacation to see it again at night .,1
the view of paris is wonderful .,1
"we were intending to go first thing in the morning about 9am as the guide book recommend , but after the time it took to walk there from pont neuf along the river bank , it was nearly midday .",1
and then see second level on the way down .,1
the only tickets we could get were for a night time ascent .,1
poor planning left us with little time to go to the upper levels .,1
stroll near the siene .,1
but you have to go to the top if you can .,1
on the second trip we took a day trip from london to paris which was brilliant .,1
i had bought tickets online but was not able to queue until my stated time had already passed because the queue was still dealing with people 2 time slots in front of me !,1
"when you are in the grounds you then choose another queue ... the stair option looked a bit shorter , we still waited well over an hour in the 29degree heat !",1
"some friends persuaded me to join them , however , and it was a wonderful experience .",1
"nonetheless , the french policewoman patted me down thoroughly .",1
c'est bon !,1
it was worth it to say that i 've been to the top .,1
i love seeing it and walking around at the bottom but going up is a queuing nightmare .,1
we came to paris at evening time and within 2 hours the eiffel tower was lighted .,1
they were charging $ 30 a bottle for a $ 4 bottle of wine .,1
the views are awesome .,1
"did n't know until a friend said to us to visit on the hour as the tower lights up then , glad to have been told this as it was magnificent to see ,",1
sadly this did not work out .,1
everyone visiting paris would anyway visit the eiffel .,1
we were traveling with a 7 and 5 year old .,1
you can take steps to 1st and 2nd floor or take elevator alternatively .,1
"we purchased our tickets rather last minute -lrb- not intentionally -rrb- through get your guide as package deal -lrb- for the tower , a boat tour -lrb- les beatuex along the seine , the louvre - all skip the line - as well as .",1
the effiel tower it 's self is gorgeous but not as tall as i thought it would be .,1
we visited in april and when trying to reserve on line found that they were already booked six weeks in advance for advance sales .,1
the level of food sophistication and price will determine which of the two places you might dine at .,1
"the eiffel tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world , a title it held for 41 years .",1
it should take something warmer to wear .,1
we descended to the first level via stairs .,1
"evening probably presents the most spectacular views , but crowds are really bad .",1
would advise pre-booking jump the queue tickets though as the queues can get very long,1
"however , the tower combined with the park and the sunshine made it a pleasant experience as we had a lovely picnic there .",1
"the people was looked like ants , very tiny .",1
you can also choose to pay and go up to different levels of the tower .,1
"at night , the beauty of the lights , was touching .",1
the 1st level has a restaurant and gift shops located on it .,1
you should see it both in day light and at night .,1
we were told that they are some of the best .,1
"my 2nd visit , first was a few decades ago and whaddya know it has n't changed ... well except for the color !",1
i would n't bother visiting just for the restaurant - there are better for less .,1
the lines are long and slow for those who wait to buy their tickets at the time of your visit .,1
"amazing view , architecture , vibe ... felt so good going up and enjoying a day at the tower , some options up there for food etc. .",1
very windy but spectacular views of the city .,1
"i suggest enjoying the view of it while you 're on your way to do something else , but above all , do n't stand in line and pay to get to the top of it .",1
"go to the local super marche or the boulangerie , buy all that you need for a picnic near the eiffel tower .",1
i am sure you can guess which one was better in terms of not having as much people .,1
"you absolutely , positively have to have a pre-purchased ticket to take the elevator up the tower .",1
we went on a day trip to paris from london and went straight to the tower from the train station .,1
you really ca n't go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
amazing of course !,1
"be sure to arrive early , especially if you want to go all the way to the top as it fills up fast .",1
we took the multi day pass for the local travel .,1
we even went up to the 2nd floor to experience to be inside the eiffel tower .,1
"while staying in paris we visited the eiffel tower twice , ones at day time and ones at night-unforgettable memories .",1
never went up eiffel tower as our money had been taken .,1
book in advance to skip the big q .,1
i want to return and do it all again .,1
one of a kind .,1
we booked fast tickets so we did not have to waste hours in the daily queue .,1
arrive just before nightfall to get pictures during the day and night .,1
i loved climbing the stairs to the top because you can take pictures all along and it is cheaper and not so tiring .,1
"my 11 year old and i did n't pre book tickets , we just turned up , lined up for about 5 minutes and walked up to the first level via the stairs .",1
iconic and worth it .,1
the ticket system needs greater efficiency .,1
we finally made it to the top ... and it was worth it .,1
well it is done .,1
its advisable to book tickets online otherwise one has to spend a lot of time waiting in the tickets queue .,1
standing underneath the structure gives a good enough feeling for its design without going up in it .,1
it turned out that the south pier is for stairs only and the queue was moving much quicker so we went and joined that .,1
you ca n't visit paris and not see the eiffel tower !,1
the view was clear and security was not difficult either .,1
"we walked to the second floor , much cheaper than the lift and the queues were so much shorter !",1
plan on big crowds .,1
got the 5:30 pm time slot and showed up 15 minutes before our time slot with our printed e tickets .,1
"over all it was a great experience except for the line up for tickets , bearing in mind it was 37 degrees there was no shade and the water must spray was in completed the wrong position to provide any relief .",1
"if you are fit enough , you can experience climbing up the stairs to the top .",1
i heartily recommend !,1
it is just a repetition of the same stuff .,1
"every time i go to paris , i have to see it .",1
once you reach the top you can see breath taking wonderful views of paris .,1
the gift shops had very nice things in them and the lunch we had was very good .,1
we arrived at the tower on a monday morning around 11.00 am .,1
take the time to enjoy the amazing vantage points along the entire perimeter if time permits .,1
however be careful in the surrounding areas close to the tower especially near the park .,1
the city is so beautiful and very interesting to view from above .,1
really very special and must visit spot in paris you simply ca n't visit paris and go there loved the whole area what a beautiful time we had,1
"good view of the city , especially in sunset .",1
nice visit .,1
kids loved the city views at night .,1
its ` unique structure has been placed in pictures for more than a century .,1
breathtaking view nonetheless .,1
the lights of this city make it so romantic .,1
"while all of this took place at the end of january and it was so very cold , what an unforgettable experience it was !",1
the men selling trinkets on the street were harmless .,1
the beauty about going there at night is being able to experience the special lighting effects that occurs on the hour .,1
in the cold wind .,1
but still beautiful,1
i did not visit the eiffel tower until my 2014 trip .,1
we booked our ticket to go up the eiffel tower and are very glad we did you have to go through security checks as you do every where in paris now but with a 2 hour queue as well that would have been intolerable .,1
went to the top and had great views of paris .,1
"it 's iconic , mesmerizing and profound .",1
710 steps .,1
the lift up to it however is not for claustrophobic people !,1
at night for a different perspective on paris !,1
i was in paris for a few days and walking around trying to find a store to buy some cigarettes .,1
get tickets that go to `` sommet '' in order to get all the way to the top .,1
i doubt i would ever go back on this structure .,1
the people that work there are not friendly .,1
if you wanted to use the elevator you would have had to queue for a while .,1
"pickpockets and people selling you stuff here rather annoying and gets a bit much , goverment need to stop this",1
we had plenty of time to eat .,1
"we would definitely climb the tower again , but we 'd definitely go up to the second level this time .",1
skip the lines by buying tickets beforehand .,1
it is definitely worth a visit to the top .,1
"a major distraction to this beautiful monument and a disgrace to paris and french , who i have always praised from my perspective as a tourist as being one of the cleanest , most well organized and all around great country to visit .",1
arriving at tour crowd looked long to get in but first queue was only a security check .,1
i 'm not sure if purchasing a `` tour '' would have made it better ?,1
you do pay to go under the structure as well as a fee to go in it .,1
to add to this if the 3rd floor is crowded the entry to the top level is stopped for congestion .,1
"rue de grenelle , not far off , has a lot of restaurants that are n't tourist traps .",1
we approached the tower from the trocadero .,1
would highly recommend everyone to see it while in paris !,1
we had a great time visiting the eiffel tower .,1
at night this landmark sparkles as the lights twinkle .,1
we only saw this from the outside .,1
the eiffel tower has to be the icon of paris .,1
"first you have to go through security and they dont leave you pass with any bottle , after that line up to buy your tickets , i ca n't urge enough to make a reservation , so you do n't wait and hour to buy them , buy the one to the top floor and the pictures will make it worth it , there 's also going to be a line to go to the top floor but you ca n't avoid that one .",1
the distance from gare du nord to the tower is about 11 km .,1
"purchase tickets in advance , if possible .",1
it was a lot of fun .,1
"the first thing you 'll notice about the tower is that it is huge , much bigger in real life than i ever imagined .",1
one of the most iconic structures of france !,1
"several people told me not to go , they however , had never been .",1
the place is very good and going upto top of it was really an amazing expriance.the sorrounding i.e. sean river is very good,1
the view was perfect .,1
we did not book the tickets to the top in advance but luckily the queue was not very long .,1
we also visited it for the first time at 10pm when the lights began to sparkle .,1
the day we went there were no lines and we got up very quickly .,1
the sights from the top is unbelievable .,1
"as far as price is concerned , value for money is good ... the restaurants on the tower can be somewhat pricey but its not a must .",1
you can not visit paris without going up the tower !,1
staff very friendly and there are signs everywhere saying beware pickpockets .,1
"amazing views from the top , ridiculously priced drinks though -lrb- because they can -rrb- so be prepared !",1
the view is magical .,1
we arrived early and queued for approx 30mins before opening .,1
enjoy first level restaurant regardless of other reviews still good views and good food .,1
the eiffel tower is just as beautiful during the day as it is at night .,1
"althoug , prices are steep , i would personally reccomend buying the paris pass museum pass .",1
sharing a glass of champagne on the top deck with my fiancee on her 30th birthday as the sun set is a memory we will never forget .,1
"it 's a terrific way to see all of paris below you ... and , if you go there , a ride to the top is an obvious !",1
it took 5 minutes walk from champ de mars station .,1
"when in paris , you must see the eiffel tower !",1
"we were on a tour that skipped the long lines , a good idea if your time is limited .",1
the children were terrified .,1
then the views take in the amazing architecture that abounds around paris .,1
it was beautiful getting to watch the `` light shows '' every hour or so from the lawn .,1
ended up walking up to the first floor for our lunch booking and then taking the lift up to the 2nd floor .,1
"it 's absolutely , breathtakingly beautiful day and night .",1
access to the tower was closed .,1
it 's so beautiful and incredibe .,1
they got us in right away after printing our tickets .,1
anything i say about this magnificent structure is inadequate .,1
"in the night , it is a wonderful pleasure to see the tower is full lights , very eye-pleasing .",1
watching eiffel tower glowing during night is really incredible .,1
it was n't our first visit but every time we come to paris we come to see eiffel tower .,1
it was exceptionally hot on the first day -lrb- global warming may be -rrb- ... but later two days it rained so the temperature came down with cool breeze whole day .,1
we dined at the % * restaurant for my husband 's birthday .,1
just a beautiful tower and i feel very honored to have now witnessed its beauty in person .,1
the crowds of tourists are confining .,1
amazing panoramic views of the city.toasted this magnificent city with a glass of champagne .,1
"in the evenings , the tower flickers on the hour every hour for about the first 10 minutes - a sight to behold .",1
"what a place , what a view .",1
or better still pre purchase your tickets .,1
"and the night-twinkling lights are gorgeous , and fun !",1
"the view from on top , which is of course what you want to see is impressive , but sadly the impression we took away was of the length of time to get the top and crush of people to get past .",1
"the twinkling light show was okay but not for me , people seem to like it .",1
excellent light show at night with lots of interesting activities going on at the trocadero !,1
we paid 17euro per person to get tickets to take the elevator to the summit .,1
all i needed was to see it and take a picture .,1
we took a bus tour of paris and `` hopped off '' at the eiffel tower .,1
so shop early .,1
went all the way to the top .,1
"the elevators are jam packed , so do n't expect great views on the way up unless you snag a window location .",1
we missed it with a 9:30 tour .,1
try to go on a clear day so you can see all of paris .,1
yes you have to que but the sights around you are amazing .,1
"having said that , there is no need to further describe this amazing structure , and only say : when you are in paris , go and see the tower and look at this engineering marvel from all sides and from down and up .",1
"when people come to paris , they must see this majestic icon of the city ...",1
we took the elevator up to the 2nd level and enjoyed the excellent view of paris and its many sights and monuments .,1
"by going on an evening when it had been raining , the lines were practically non-existent , even after the rain had passed .",1
passing on a tip that we got from a lovely brazilian tourist : make your way to trocadero metro station at night to catch the eiffel tower sparkle .,1
i found the tower was much nicer to look at whilst laying on the grass in the evenings than it was to climb .,1
baby buggies have to be folded but i am unsure this is for the x ray scanner or the lift .,1
it is not one of the best rated attractions without a reason : -rrb-,1
we were walking around in the city near the eiffel tower not knowing it was around the corner .,1
"there 's hot food pop up 's but there are loads of birds flying around and there is a lot of rubbish left on the floor , could do with more bins .",1
i was pleasantly surprised on this trip that the surrounding area seems to have been cleaned up .,1
"however , the eiffel tower is so iconic that if you 're in paris , you have to do it .",1
it 's great to see the views from the first and second floors and there is bars at the floors serving alcohol and soft drinks and little swings to sit on an tables to sit at which is great and has a very lively atmosphere to it .,1
a brilliant experience to go to the very top and see the views .,1
"at night the vendors get a bit more aggressive and they also try to give you roses and want you to buy glasses of wine , etc. .",1
it is very crowded and very touristy but worth it .,1
there were lots of places that you can go to get the perfect photo .,1
we went up by elevator but came part way down by stairs .,1
views were amazing from all angles .,1
bravo !,1
it 's one of the sites that screams paris to me .,1
we took the elevator up to the first level of the tower during the day - the elevator to the top was temporarily closed .,1
it 's fun .,1
"we took a tour together with the cruise on seine it was well worth it , very informative and you cut the long line to the 2nd floor .",1
if you go to paris and do not visit it you waist your time !,1
make sure you see it at night lit up and sparkling on the hour .,1
best of both views .,1
an attraction not to miss .,1
"we used the lift to the second floor , the view from there was really nice .",1
"during our visit , we experienced partly cloudy conditions , so overall not too bad .",1
"its the iconic eiffel tower ... if you are in paris , you just have to visit it ... the lines for the elevator to the top can be miles long , biut get there early before the tour busses arrive ... the view from the top ... ces ' t magnifique !",1
never get tired of visiting this tower !,1
"we did , on a cold december day .",1
definetly it 's the heart of the city and a must see .,1
then capture the moments of the sunset and stay one hour more to see the city lights .,1
"i did n't expect to love the landmark as much as i did , but it was stunning and well worth seeing it and riding to the top .",1
enjoyed it 's sight by day from different points in paris including the arc de triumph and the pantheon .,1
i had the most amazing time with my husband & 5 year old daughter in paris .,1
"we did n't have time to wait in line for tickets the first time we went to paris , so on our second trip we got tickets before we left home .",1
went to the top of tower during the day for a virtual view of the city .,1
they did not think the trip would have been complete without going up .,1
"get there early so you wo n't wait too long , still if you are there by 10 am on a week day you wo n't wait more then 45 minutes .",1
i was able to get great shots handheld into the evening .,1
beware that lifts are jam-packed !,1
if you have the means i highly recommend .,1
"overrun with tourists and shady characters trying to scam you , yet so incredible to see in real life .",1
"a visit to the lovers capital they said , the reality is , an hour q to get into the tower , then a further 2.5 hrs to q for a ticket to get up it ,",1
the view is the best from the 2nd level because you are close to the sights .,1
fyi : it 's hard to take a pic without other people in the shot !,1
used the elevator to get to the top .,1
world famous eiffel tower is worth to see once .,1
tourist are rude .,1
dont think we would go back .,1
the lines to wait for the elevators to the top are long but at least the very top platform is sheltered and the views fantastic so worth the extra money .,1
when it is dark the tower lights up and at the top of every hour sparkles for 5 minutes .,1
waiter alex was absolutely lovely really friendly and helpful .,1
you can see paris from above .,1
you can get a drink etc on the second level .,1
the views were beyond spectacular !,1
we rode the elevator down for free but you could take the stairs down if you choose to .,1
be sure to come back when it 's dark to view the tower all lit up and flashing on the hour .,1
"we opted to go up another monument and see the tower in our views and i am glad we did as the queues were huge and security looked very busy also , so would n't recommend if you are in a rush !",1
"however , while we were on the way to the tower , we received an email from the eiffel tower ticket office telling us that the tower was closed for the day because of events that had occurred the night before.the night before , france had played portugal in the final soccer game and there were riots after the game .",1
"then we went down to the second floor , and the new 1st floor , which was great as well .",1
"my last trip to the eiffel tower was a a child and i remember it being clean , as it was traveling there now as an adult with 2 children and my mum .",1
a beautiful adventure !,1
standing new effeil is like dream come true .,1
"if you go next year , arrive early to scope out a place .",1
our guide was witty and knowledgeable .,1
ca n't be missed attraction .,1
but the walk to and beneath is free and well worth it .,1
spectacular view from the summit .,1
at this point there was a lot of panic as no one knew what the security issue was .,1
"if we had gone to the top that day , we would have seen nothing because it was fogged in with no view of anything .",1
we can also buy souvenirs at 2nd floor .,1
we visited 58 tour eiffel and enjoyed a lovely meal .,1
"we walked up all the stairs , and stayed until sun set !",1
it is a bit touristy -- supposedly the most visited place in the world .,1
specially the 3 wheelers and souvenir ones .,1
if you have time have a bite at the restaurant .,1
the views from both floors are good but it is worth going to the top .,1
"before coming in ' eiffel was n't on top of my list of things to experience in paris but when i caught a glimpse of its mesmerizing beauty of lights , i immediately drove to it .",1
"i did n't have the time for it , because i did not buy my ticket in advance .",1
i would recommend going at night .,1
it was an amazing experience .,1
simply marvelous !,1
a must visit place if you are visiting paris - the city of love .,1
we were there after the brussel bombings and they lit it up in the colors of the belgium flag .,1
they wo n't sell you a ticket for the top .,1
it is obligatory to go .,1
"the eiffel tower is truly a magnificent piece of architecture , we have always dreamed of going to france and seeing some of the worlds greatest culturally fascinating places and this was definitely one of those bucket list things .",1
although do n't attempt it if you 're even slightly unsure of heights .,1
we bought tickets to the top at the window on the second level for 6 euros each .,1
"the queue for the top level elevator was so long we decided to forgo it , but the kids rated the visit as one of their favourite experiences in paris nonetheless .",1
"a must visit in paris , beyond any doubt .",1
we enjoyed it and thought it was worth the time .,1
"there is noting special , this monument as a symbol of paris is extremely over rated for sure .",1
once at the bottom we went to champ de mars to take photos .,1
the gardens surrounding are very well kept .,1
great view of city not to be missed .,1
"there is a restaurant on the first floor , with the full first floor having a transparent floor , and a champagne bar on the top floor , open until 10 pm .",1
the lift up was tense ... i did n't realise the ticket actually meant summit !,1
buy your ticket online and visit with no wait .,1
june of late september should be less crowded .,1
there are signs everywhere say in beware pick pockets so i held my bag tight .,1
but really - it is a tall building built by man to say how great man is - i think i would have preferred climbing a mountain .,1
"however , when you actually went under it , it was just amazing and i will go again",1
you just have to see it .,1
i 've climbed the tower to the 2nd level on 4 separate occasions now - and it is still amazing .,1
"once you 're in the 2nd floor , go and buy tickets for the 3rd floor - it 's totally worth it .",1
"cold and windy , but still amazing , no line to wait in we we visited , maybe because it was freezing !",1
i had been there during the day too .,1
this is everyone 's dream and it finally came true .,1
we ended up finding a tour through fat tire tours that provided a seine river cruise and an evening ticket to the tower .,1
"hot food , well presented and tasty .",1
hugely enjoyable and worth every penny .,1
this place is perfect !,1
everyone should wish to look at the tower also in the evening as the lights come on .,1
its worth at least once a visit in ones lifetime .,1
there are a few restaurants at the top but the main attraction is the view from the top !,1
i enjoy being there at night when the tower sparkles at the top of the hour .,1
a beautiful sight both on day and night .,1
but we would never have missed the experience .,1
this is a must visit when in paris .,1
we signed up for a skip-the-line through viator and it was well worth the small extra expense .,1
"impossible to miss as it dominates the paris skyline , the eiffel tower offers wonderful views of paris in all directions .",1
we had excellent weather and so were the views .,1
visited the eiffel tower without pre-booking any tickets .,1
"do your self a favour ... buy a `` skip the line '' ticket and go on your own as the tour tickets are pricey and you really do n't need someone telling you what you can read yourself , online , before visiting .",1
since our hotel was only a block away from the eiffel tower we took many pictures of this amazing monument .,1
"good during the day but crowded , amazing at night but still crowded .",1
"a spectacular landmark , the queues are rather horrendous but well worth getting a ` jump the queue ' ticket .",1
i did n't think that i would be too impressed but the closer i got the better it got .,1
i went around 11pm and it was great !,1
there are many kiosks all around selling the same items but cheaper .,1
"have always wanted to go up the eiffel tower and finally did this trip , a bit of a let down , as you are herded about like cattle , but the view was impressive at the top , one of the highlights was the glass floor on the lower deck .",1
the view from the top of the tower is just surreal .,1
very crowded and touristic but its a very beautifull building,1
"after reading some mixed reviews we almost did n't go up the eiffel tower , thankfully we did end up going !",1
"to avoid the queues we booked at the tower eiffel 58 restaurant for an evening meal , gives you tower access , no queue , and an excellent meal .",1
however the curing was worth the wait .,1
we got there around 5:30 so it was still daylight and you could see for miles around .,1
"red , white and blue .",1
only drawback is the mob of scam artist and pushy vendors that lurk at the base .,1
an iconic sight during the day was made spectacular at night .,1
"if you are there , you just feel the romance ... the beauty of the tower by night ... just great .",1
the very top is only accessible with the lift .,1
romantic much ?,1
we did a tour of the tower up to the top floor during the day .,1
also if you choose a outside bar in paris to sit and have drinks expect near 20 euros for 2 drinks .,1
do n't know how the evening lines are .,1
from there we went to 3rd floor on other lift .,1
the city of lights !!!,1
the views from the top were stunning but it was way too busy and crowded .,1
"this did take the thrill and romanticism away , but i was at least feeling secure .",1
i reached the top where i and my sister enjoyed a glass of the bubbly .,1
"it gives you an exe lent view of the tower , a great photo pop , an has a museum .",1
the eiffel tower is stunning .,1
we recently visited eiffel for the 3rd time and this week was surprised to see such long queues for security checks even before getting to another queue for ticket office,1
this was well worth doing as it meant that we did n't have to queue for long and were able to enjoy the view from all levels of the tower .,1
we chose the 8pm slot so that we could see the city at night .,1
i 'm glad we went to check it off our list .,1
loved every moment .,1
it was cold for our 8:00 pm reservation -lrb- tickets purchased on-line and in advance -rrb- but what an amazing experience .,1
your trip to paris is never complete without a visit to the eiffel tower !,1
"make sure you book these tickets in advance , it saves the headache and longer line to enter .",1
"in one day we did eiffel tower , notra dame , the louvre and a water tour on the seine .",1
if you 've not seen the eiffel tower yet get it done .,1
and the lines to go up the tower were so long we did n't even consider going to the top .,1
perfect for lovers .,1
paris is everything you could imagine and more .,1
stand under the tower and look up and up and up .,1
i recommend booking a skip the line tour around sunset !,1
absolutely worth a visit at day or night time .,1
"but even then , it truly is breathtaking .",1
"i love to go right to the top and walk around , especially on a clear day because you can see for miles around and have fun spotting/guessing the buildings that you can see .",1
i recommend getting there early when it 's not too busy and you do n't have to wait too long to queue up for a ticket .,1
my personal favorite was the top of the arc de triomphe .,1
it was so beautiful .,1
the next day we booked and went up to the top of the tower .,1
watch out for pan handling lots in area asking for charity .,1
the eiffel tower is a must-see when in paris .,1
our guide was wonderful .,1
lots of people !,1
"by day , it is a nice place to visit .",1
do n't forget to stay around until 10 pm in the summer when the lights flash on the tower,1
and we visited the top of the eiffel tower .,1
i would not recommend actually going up to the top though .,1
"we only had 48 hours in paris , so did n't spend much time on tickets/waiting in line .",1
"we woke up early and made our way towards the tower -lrb- by metro , which was the easiest thing to do , in spite of the slight language barrier -rrb- , and arrived at the grounds around 9:00 am .",1
excelkent landmark at anytime during your visit to paris .,1
"the view of course is great , from both level 2 and the top .",1
view from the top was superb .,1
"really good price at only $ 12 for 2 people , and we walked up so great exercise too !",1
"do it , you will enjoy the views .",1
you 'll go first to the top and then ascend .,1
there 's really not much to say about this that has n't already been said .,1
a not to be missed experience !,1
a trip to eiffel tower means more pictures/photos/views .,1
stay a while and make it back down to see the tower 's twinkling light show .,1
please ask the gods to be with you and let the sun shine in ; -rrb-,1
you have to see the eiffel tower if you 're in paris .,1
"well worth a visit , day or night , but stunning at night .",1
long queue for taking tickets ... view from the top is really amazing ... treat to watch at night ... highly recomended,1
we easily walked to the eiffel tower around the time of fireworks and not worrying about need to catch metro after the fireworks show .,1
once you 've enjoyed the tower relax at trocadero or the aquarium .,1
this has to be by far the best place i have ever visited .,1
but i did n't go up to the tower .,1
my friends and i ate sandwiches in front of the eiffel tower and had a true parisian experience .,1
it 's a shame that so much security is required but it is the day we live in .,1
the view and exercise were tremendous !,1
i end up puting in the bin beer and water .,1
a climb on a tall structure and see paris from a height ?,1
i 'm a bit mixed with the eiffel tower .,1
a loverly way to spend the evening with wow views .,1
skies cleared up towards the evening and as it 's open until 22h00 and it does n't get dark until late -lrb- visited late may -rrb- we decided to go back -lrb- by metro to bir hakeim -rrb- .,1
because of antiquity and the huge metal construction is attractive .,1
"of course we had seen endless photos of the eiffel tower in movies and such , but nothing compares to seeing it in person .",1
great paris view and what a tower !!,1
"we sat in the garden across eiffel , when it started sparkling around 9.30 p.m. amazing and most romantic view to capture with your partner around .",1
there is nothing i can say about this famous monument that has not already been said .,1
had a tour with viator - the guide was punctual .,1
"finally , the elevator ride up was actually pretty fun since it goes up at an angle and the top was scary high but the view itself was not absolutely incredible .",1
layout of paris was magical .,1
"the lovely lawns around are wonderful any summer 's day and for the kids , there 's the carousel .",1
its still a wait but much shorter .,1
your basically spending most of ur time there queing tbh as there 's a constant stream of people moving it 's so busy at the top .,1
typically a tourist place beware of bags n stuff while catching up the light show on the tower,1
"yes , it 's better now that you can reserve a ticket ahead , but it will still be an exercise in patience to get to the top .",1
it was short ques and to see paris with all the beautiful lights in the night where amazing .,1
this place is a must visit when in paris .,1
it makes it have more significance in some way .,1
the view of the tower itself is amazing and calls for numerous clicks and the view of the city from the top is amazing as well .,1
"obviously , it goes without saying that you will visit the eiffel tower on your visit to paris .",1
scored extra points with my girlfriend !,1
when i was in paris it was too cold and the northern wind was a pain .,1
"its my 2nd time at eiffel , first time was summer july 2015 but very chilly up the 2nd level at night .",1
so we went through an ameican website get your guide .,1
must try a cup of coffee and enjoy the view .,1
we walked around all four sides and got very nice photos of paris at sunset .,1
full of people but everything is well organized .,1
i went to see this attraction in the afternoon but made it a point to go see it in the dark too and i must say it looked even more amazing .,1
breath-taking .,1
"the food was really good and i have no real complaints , just found this service very bizarre .",1
"it 's breath taking , especially at night when it twinkles .",1
"long lines to get up the tower , as was expected , but it 's just worth it to go there and be in awe at the sight and scale of the tower .",1
my daughter went ice skating which was an extra bonus during our visit .,1
the work that has gone into this gorgeous structure is absolutely incredible .,1
"if you wish to see the paris from above , then this is the place .",1
beautiful lady of paris !,1
the views were amazing and it was great to see the structure in person .,1
"all in all , it was a wonderful experience-one not to miss !!",1
i 've been here a few times over the years but my most memorable to date is my sis and i taking my mom on her 70th birthday .,1
"we spent over an hour , hour and a half in the tower itself , so do leave plenty of time to visit , including queuing .",1
"i was speechless , when i saw that in front of me .",1
so annoying but overall i have wonderful holiday in paris,1
"i enjoyed the architecture and several other views of it at different time of the day , and at different places .",1
i felt really nostalgic as i had read a lot about it and had never imagined that i would see it myself .,1
if you do prebook and go at night the entrance to use is not that obvious but is at the river seine end of the tower opposite the information desk - a small hut with a green banner at the top .,1
but needed queue to get out from the tower .,1
"this is just so spectacular , highly recommend to visit the tower at nigh it lights up beautifully .",1
loved it at night sparkles and lights up amazing not to be missed .,1
when at the top he was buzzing .,1
"although there are stairs to the third and highest level , these are usually closed to the public and it is generally only accessible by lift .",1
"and because it was the evening tour , the tower lit up while we were on it .",1
you can buy those tower miniatyres half price from souvinier shops,1
i recommend going at the end of the visiting hours at night as the cues are very very short when compared the morning hours,1
tip : sign up for and use the `` skip the line '' tours .,1
"interesting facts to know about when , how and why it was built .",1
"the new glass floor section is fun to walk over , just be brave .",1
"the crowds prove how popular the eiffel tower , but purchasing tickets in advance make it easy to avoid the lines .",1
"all i will say is this : it is paris , it is the eiffel tower , and you must see it if you go .",1
long queues and crowded lifts .,1
we thoroughly enjoyed or day and would definitely recommend it !,1
"however , there is so much to see and do in paris , that i would consider just a visit below for the photos - and keep going .",1
we could n't get booked to go up the tower morning or night on any of the 5 days we were there .,1
"when we were buying tickets it said the top was closed so we were discouraged but when we got up there , it was open .",1
somehow you will feel peaceful .,1
the history is interesting and the view is spectacular .,1
i guess if you time your visit when there are far less people or book some kind of tour that skips the line it would be great but when it is crowded its not worth the wait .,1
during the summer be prepared for very long lines in the sun and heat .,1
i 'm so glad that i did n't get discouraged by the lines and the cost of the ticket .,1
"if climbing is your thing , have at it .",1
since q was long so i decided to skip going to top of tower and it was expansive to .,1
scary !,1
better enjoyed from the outside .,1
"do n't go during the summer , you will wait forever !",1
it was my first time to paris and wanted to do all the touristy things .,1
i probably would n't recommend buying the tickets to jump the queue as those queues were longer than the normal ones !,1
"too many people also pickpockets this is a very dangerous place , lots of thieves .",1
it 's so much more bigger than u can imaginine !,1
he ...,1
long queue to reach the ticket booth but well worth it .,1
"when we first got a glimpse of the tower from a distance , it took our breath away !",1
the second was thru the roof deck of the bus tour that we took of the city sights .,1
the views are incredible and it is fascinating to be right inside the structure .,1
this has to be done .,1
since my last visit to paris a chain-link fence has been erected around the based of the tower with security screening ports through which visitors are cleared .,1
"if you have the good fortune to spend several days in paris , be sure to explore or notice the eiffel tower multiple times during the day and evening .",1
the first thing that i wanted to visit in my life .,1
views are terrific .,1
we were on the evening .,1
the hourly light shows at night are really worth your time as well .,1
it is worth the visit just to say you 've seen it so do n't let my review put you off,1
i was so surprised by how much i loved this !,1
it was everything i expected !,1
"for lovers , for friends , for the young , and young at heart , this magnificent structure provides unique transportation to its upper floors as well as magnificent views of the city in all directions .",1
we were blessed with a clear day .,1
but the site of the tower and the romance that it inspires trumps the negatives .,1
stay clear of thugs at the garden nearby .,1
the tower is just fabulous !!!,1
but things have changed .,1
"if you booked for 1pm and we did and turn up at noon you will be turned away till your time slot , as happenned to us .",1
you 'll love the twinkle .,1
get there as early as possible for the best views in the morning and go back some time during your trip if possible to see it lit up at night on the hour .,1
every visit has a different experience .,1
"be careful and do n't make eyecontct with all the people selling stuff near the tower , it was super annoying to be constatnly bugged to buy crap .",1
"if you are planning a trip , be sure to purchase your tickets on their website prior to going , otherwise , you 'll either be out of luck , or waiting in a very long queue .",1
i got a wonderful photo of the moon over the city .,1
very nice photographs were clicked .,1
be aware that there is a bag size limit going through security and that there is no bag storage .,1
this will '' top off '' all trips to paris .,1
unsurpassed 360 degree views from the top of the whole of paris .,1
the infrastructure of the tower itself was impressive .,1
you must go during the day and the night .,1
nice city but at every tourist attraction pickpockets and scams even when the police is on site .,1
we saw from a distance at night .,1
the tour guide spoke very clear english and knew loads on the history of the tower and the bunker .,1
the best time to visit the eiffel tower would be at night .,1
"the parks around the tower help frame the views , especially if you cross the river .",1
"pre-booking the tickets for entry was the best idea , the queues to get in were longggggg -lrb- as you would imagine on such an icon place -rrb- .",1
"like most of tourist places , eiffel tower is always crowded & full of pickpockets .",1
the park nearby is not fully grassed so come prepared with mat or you 'll be sitting on dirt .,1
"the day we visited , every where we looked was someone with a clipboard trying to take our attention or a huge number of shiny gold rings picked from pavement and offered to us , all of these were scams but once we got into the tower and away from all this we felt much safer .",1
"so , if you 've seen it ; do n't rush back ... .",1
but during winter there is a lot less people around and the view from the top is as amazing !,1
a visit to paris must include the eiffel tower !,1
our guide ben was extremely knowledgeable and interesting and we skipped the long lines of people waiting to enter the tower and head to the top !,1
it is the paris you always dreamed of !,1
no way !,1
it was super cold at the time though so we didnt stay too long .,1
"we moved slowly for what seemed ages , then i began to feel dizzy .",1
me and my girlfriend booked a tour to go up the effiel tower aswell as going to the top .,1
we had such a nice visit up the eiffel tower .,1
a must see when travelling to paris .,1
"i 'd recommend arriving early if you have n't pre booked ticket , going on a clear day will maximise you 're views too .",1
by the time we walked around and got in the weather has become pretty crappy so we just stood at the bottom and took some photos -lrb- the park area was blocked off to show the euros game later on -rrb- regardless was still an amazing attraction and would love to go back at a different time .,1
an amazing structure and we went up because it is there and so were we .,1
note : this place is definitely not suitable for people that hates the long queues .,1
"there has been quite a change from our last visit , for several reasons .",1
their is no one to ask something .,1
there you have a open place where your eyes can have the privilege of seeing the best view of eiffel tower .,1
i did have my 5 year old on my back for the walk down .,1
we visited both day and night ... and you should do the same .,1
"it is not as hard as you may think , and most tourists do n't do it , so it is not overly crowded either .",1
travelled the siene and just seeing the tower from there was lovely .,1
wrong !,1
the other set of lights started at 10.00 p.m and stayed for 5 minutes .,1
it comes on at every hour by only lasts 10 minutrs,1
great to sit and relax on the greens .,1
"we had a bad experience in the area , as our video camera was stolen ... put a damper on the whole experience : -lrb-",1
this is of course a must see if you are visiting paris .,1
"the view is amazing , and the feeling of being at the top of the tour eiffel ... .",1
unfortunately could n't really go up to the eiffel tower as the queue had a 3hr waiting time .,1
"all in all , a great visit .",1
"the lines are long , but it 's worth it .",1
"once at mid-level , if you want to go all the way to the top , simply pay a top up ticket fee and head up .",1
there are three levels you can visit .,1
has to be done but not my favourite place in paris .,1
"btw , we can climb up by stair in daytime .",1
"unfortunately we traveled when it was raining , so we were n't allowed to go to the top .",1
must see at least once in your life !,1
not all tickets include access right to the top but i highly recommend this and would have been disappointed if i had n't been all the way up .,1
fantastic,1
we also had dinner here on the 2nd floor and the staff here were excellent .,1
we did n't actually go up the tower but it looked like a glorified blackpool tower to me and my family .,1
this place is a wonder .,1
it 's simply an amazing experience .,1
book ahead at the restaurant to kick your self again with the view taking in all of paris with love,1
"it is incredible to see , at any time of day , but it is most magnificent at night .",1
wonderful experience and especially views from the top .,1
"seeing this structure with your own eyes simply leaves you breathless , so is it any wonder tourists flock to this site in their thousands on a daily basis .",1
and once there you can appreciate the inspiring majesty of it 's design .,1
just watch ...,1
fun to join the crowd .,1
it was like hanging out in a terrace bar but you could have anything from lunch to a glass of beer to a simple coffee .,1
"city wonders limited put on this tour of the eiffel tower that was very informative and explained the who , what and where of the eiffel tower very well .",1
make sure you pre-book tickets .,1
"it is freezing and very windy at the top so , bring a coat with a hood and gloves in the winter/autumn .",1
3 hours roughly waiting time in the summer .,1
"buy tickets from the official eiffel tower website if you can , it sell out fast ... start checking daily at least three months prior to travel to skip the long lines .",1
magical evening a top effiel tower in le jules verne restaurant .,1
of course you can not go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
when we came down at 2-3pm it was empty of queues so that 's best time to go .,1
tacky but no visit to paris would be complete without looking at eiffel 's masterpiece .,1
5 times i 've been here over the past 30 years and i go back to stand under this tower or climb the stair every time .,1
"if you 're visiting paris , this is the must do attraction .",1
try to book in advance as you can go into the priority line but this will have some delays as they have the x ray scanner and bag searches regardless what line you are in .,1
its a must do !,1
"beautiful city view of paris , we could spot most monuments of paris .",1
the tower is one of those landmarks you have to see while your in paris .,1
there 's a cafe on the first tier -lrb- i am pretty sure -rrb- and in winter there is an ice rink .,1
it can be purchased at the counter .,1
we decided to take the lift up and walk down just to experience it and were glad we did .,1
lines were long and tiring .,1
but we have no choice cause getting a reserved lift ticket by yourself seems to be impossible .,1
"an amazing view from the 2nd floor , it was worth the wait .",1
"a bit tedious to go up during peak season , but to each his own .",1
very impressive to see such an iconic building in real life !,1
we took steps downstairs which allowed us some great views which would have been missed if we take the lift .,1
spectacular views but queue for a very long time firstly to pass through security which - the alarm wand was buzzing and people just sent through not searched and a cursory look in a handbag .,1
we had a sandwich lunch in the tower sitting outside which was nice .,1
"you are in the city center of partis next to this huge tower -lrb- 324 metres -rrb- , lit and imposive .",1
you can purchase tickets to either walk or ride .,1
must visit !,1
this place is crawling with people and merchandise stalls .,1
arrived peak time against all advice !,1
"i have also seen people say not to go up at night/in the dark , however we booked the 12pm lunch picnic with access to the 1st floor , and an 8pm summit and second floor ticket , and i felt like seeing the tower and the city lit up at night was a unique experience .",1
from the 2nd floor you can take the elevator to the summit for $ 6 to see even more amazing views .,1
visited here on the evening and had to queue but not for long really .,1
or you can choose to hire ferrari from champs elysees to eiffel .,1
the eiffel is everything and more !!,1
the que for the down elevator to get down took about 45 minutes which we were not expecting .,1
"small , but absolutely delightful !",1
we would recommend late night to avoid the crowds but capture the magic,1
"and of course the view of siene river , and most of the paris and thats worth every penny .",1
no cheap souvenirs inside fence .,1
lots of other attractions nearby - a boatride in the seine or,1
it was $ 29 for adults and $ 25 for kids .,1
set aside 2-3 hours for it .,1
i 've been to paris several times and i go see it every visit !,1
seeing the eiffel tower for the first time is quite amazing .,1
nice place to visit with your family and friends .,1
"this place is packed during the day , and honestly , always .",1
we spent the extra money to go all the way to the top .,1
which made our experience totally special and unique .,1
to visit .,1
did n't have our tickets but after getting off our ho ho bus at the troccodero and walking down to the tower we went straight to the ticket desk and bought our tickets .,1
it 's that and more .,1
we arrived at 10am with no pre paid tickets and was through security and ticket sales within half an hour .,1
every hour the lights glitter more brightly .,1
"you have to see the tower at night and at 9pm the light show and every hour until midnight i think , it 's spectacular .",1
ticket for the top floor is separate from the entrance ticket .,1
we had dinner reservations `` around the block '' and walked over at twilight and then again after dark .,1
"whether day or night eiffel tower is gorgeous , the light show start from 8pm and every one hours subsequently .",1
"for a student under 24 , it 's only 5 euros to use the stairs , which is definitely worth it !",1
when we arrived the queue were short queue and we were like the first group up to the summit so could take lots of pics without been crowded by others .,1
my husband is disappointed .,1
i highly recommend taking a tour to learn more and skip the 2-3 hour line to get up .,1
did n't need to go to the too top .,1
it was just sad to see how things have changed .,1
the 3 course menu was amazing .,1
security is strong .,1
long wait -lrb- 1hour plus -rrb- but worth it when you get to the top .,1
its the place to be on a night people selling champagne for 5 euro everyone sat laughing and joking amazing atmosphere under an amazing attraction,1
the eiffel tower is truly one of the sights you have to see in paris .,1
usually come in the winter and think i 'd stick to winter months but still a magical tower to see ☀,1
"they get chased by the police , which is amusing to watch .",1
we took my sister 's advice and booked a timed entry at eiffel tower for 9:30 pm .,1
"after queuing for security , tickets , more security , elevators we arrived on the 2nd floor .",1
if you want to take the stairs make sure you ask before you get in the line up to make sure you 're lining up in the right cue .,1
"if we 're here next year , i think we 'll stay by the riverfront .",1
took probably all of 5 minutes to get down .,1
the particular beautiful thing was the illumination .,1
"the most romantic place in the world , the entire area of beautiful gardens , architecture and the restaurant is truly amazing .",1
really enjoyed seeing the eiffel tower in person .,1
its awe inspiring and breathtaking .,1
a snack and champagne on the 2nd level was enjoyable then we decided to walk to the ground as the queue for the lift was long .,1
a lifelong dream realized .,1
it is the symbol of paris and perhaps france itself .,1
"book before you go , is the number 1 tip , we que 'd for about 1.5 hours and then there was a further que to go to the second level so even though we had paid for it we could not que again so did n't go up , we enjoyed the visit and the staff were really friendly and knowledgeable , the lift man was great and suggested that we stopped at level 1 to walk on the glass floor etc which we did not know about .",1
if you have limited time walk around the bottom but avoid going up .,1
"i went by foot steps up to second floor , which would be about 250 to 275 feet in about 18 minutes flat .",1
highly recommended at the beginning of any trip to paris .,1
"we were planning to do the same , but could not find tickets online for a time of our choosing .",1
its my second time in paris and visiting this tower.its charge 17 euro to visit until top of thd tower .,1
"we have been lucky to stay near this place so we have made a few visits , taking photos at various angles .",1
"i was there during the day , however , being there at night is probably just as wonderful .",1
probably best place to visit in paris .,1
"sadly , we were n't able to climb the top of the tower .",1
once we made it to the bottom the tower was lit up by flashing lights that go off for a couple of minutes each hour .,1
buying our tickets well ahead of time made things easy ; also they let us up 40 minutes before the time stamped on our tickets because it was a fairly light evening visitor-wise .,1
breathtaking !!!,1
"the elevators get very crowded though - expect no personal space , they cram as many people on there as possible .",1
so book now and enjoy the best view in paris .,1
it was great to see it in the day and night .,1
it did n't take more than 5 minutes to walk down .,1
went to the summit - highly recommend .,1
the eiffle tower is easy to get to with and in walking distance of quite a few cafe and there are snack huts and crape stalls actually under the eiffel tower along with souvenir shops .,1
"five visits to tour eiffel , and every time we visit this landmark and french wonder of the world , we add more memorable experiences.book a tour so you can bypass long lines .",1
impressive monument a truly master peace of engennering,1
worth every minute of wait - worth every euro of cost .,1
february - queues not too bad .,1
the twinkling lights start every hour -lrb- once it gets dark -rrb- for 5 minutes .,1
it 's not as big as you think it is in the pictures/photos but it 's still worth going to see .,1
being school holidays the queues were long no matter what time of the day we looked at going .,1
i 'm not normally scared of heights or being on tall buildings - but that lift freaked me out !,1
haha -rrb- and we went inside to get the lift .,1
what 's the point ?,1
we just did n't get tired of taking pictures .,1
you can take a tour to different levels of the tower .,1
"you can borrow skate shoes from the booth , and you 're all set to skate !",1
security was provided by armed french soldiers walking around with machine guns .,1
it would be really good if they were moved on as i was n't interested in finding out what the consequences would be if i actually took a flower and the men became quite agitated when the flower was refused .,1
my family loved it although friends we when with stopped at first level as scared of the height .,1
"the children and i loved the visit to the eiffel , although the wait in the queue was long the experience and photo opportunities were worthwhile .",1
windy and cold at night when you 're up at the summit but worth the wait and worth braving the cold !,1
it was worth all the money and travel time just to be at the top of eiffel .,1
the tour groups have the upper hand here as they have groups scheduled all day long but charge 3 times the regular cost,1
the sign of great french history .,1
you can see whole paris,1
it 's worth every penny .,1
once upon a time it was the tallest building in the world until eclipsed by the chrysler building in new york and many others since .,1
"walk up to the first and second floors , and then take a lift to the top .",1
absolutely the most beautiful view of paris .,1
i love how itś flashing every hour in the dakr : - -rrb-,1
"backstage tour of eiffel tower mechanics , and industrial and military uses was fantastic .",1
"the following day we walked past , the sun was shining and the queues were incredibly long - so i would definitely recommend booking tickets in advance .",1
very picturesque .,1
took the tour and the guide very patient extremely knowledgeable .,1
i would recommend seeing it day and night - dusk is beautiful and the twinkling lights on the tower beginning at 9 pm are a must-see .,1
either method allows you to skip the line .,1
my wife and i visited in early august .,1
they like to randomly close this ticket booth without any announcement .,1
getting off the train at the river and walking around the corner towards our hotel we were hit by the sight of the eiffel tower only 2 blocks away .,1
"my wife and i did , however .",1
also jumped the queue with lunch ticket .,1
icon for love and great man made wonder of the world .,1
"please take the obvious as read , my issue is crowd management and the sheer amount of hawkers selling selfie sticks and pure tat .",1
"so we booked eiffel tower guided tour with siene river cruise through viator , a bit expensive but there was no other option .",1
although be prepared for long queues if you want to take the elevator .,1
"the view there is beautiful , romantic and in some spots quiet , and you can find around it some spots for an on the go snacks , mainly crepe with different stuffing like nutella and cheese.and at night its a glowing tower .",1
the grounds surrounding the tower are perfect for having a picnic .,1
visited the tower along with my friends .,1
"the tower has three levels for visitors , with restaurants on the first and second .",1
"lines were too long though , so we never had the chance to actually climb the tower .",1
if you do n't mind the queues it is worth going to the top but as a nice alternative we chose to re-visit at dusk .,1
there 's about 700 steps to floor two so be prepared !,1
if you want views go up the arc de triomphe .,1
"huge long lines to wait to get to the top , sorry to say we did not wait .",1
paris so nice in the evening with the symbol - eiffel tower .,1
"spectacular views , and a must visit .",1
"love the thrill of seeing and climbing the tower , but queue for lift to 3rd level ridiculous ... i gave up waiting .",1
the presentation was so awesome we took pics of the food before we ate it,1
still the source of romance !,1
tickets are required to get inside eiffel tower and look close of that tower .,1
the eiffel tower has to be the highlight of our mini break .,1
it was every bit as beautiful and magically as i 've been told my entire life .,1
"say `` non merci , '' if you do not want a souvenir .",1
arrived about 10am on a weekday that happened to be raining so the line was short .,1
it is truly magnificent .,1
everyone must see these in their lifetime .,1
"if you prefer climbing up by stairs , definitely carry a bottle of water , might not easily find water inside eiffel and definitely not cheap .",1
well worth visiting,1
we did n't have so long queue .,1
long overdue review .,1
i had a really special occasion there looking the eiffel tower .,1
there is some magic abt this place!evennin the super cold paris winter i just love it !,1
january is a very cold month for visiting paris however it was perfect for a tour of the tower ; the line to get in was very short and once you get on the top floor you could admire the city without being pushed from other visitors,1
"it was cold , and the lines were shorter .",1
must take the elevator to at least the 3rd floor or as high as they will allow u to go .,1
"after googling the time of sunset , we made our reservation .",1
this was a great way to learn more about what i wanted to do and see next .,1
very large .,1
"this was my second trip to paris i have noticed this time that the surrounding area of the tower has become so plain , last time i came they had flowers and the garden was much better this time it was looking neglected.we took the usual photo but this time we did n't go up as the queue was horrendous .",1
must visit,1
unfortunately we left it to late to purchase tickets to go up by lift .,1
"at 11 pm our boat was infront of the tower , hence we saw the eiffel tower sparkled like a christmas tree .",1
it is my 3rd time in the eiffel tower and this time decided to go with the backstage tour to avoid the queues .,1
"on an insight vacation tour we went up to the viewing level in the eiffel tower.well worth doing this as the views are amazing.we went very early am & did n't have to queue , but the queues were quite long when we came down & were a couple of hours wait.go early",1
why would n't go see the eiffel tower ?,1
i visited eiffel tower in august end.its truelly an amazing experience.i love the architecture.i suggest get the ticket on the top and prefer the time in which u have the veiw at day time and night time as well.dont miss the light show in the night.top view of the city is really good,1
my husband and i paid the 7 euros to climb the 800 stairs which was great -lrb- and the queue is a lot smaller than the lift ! -rrb-,1
we were on the first elevator up to the second level and pretty much had the whole level to ourselves .,1
the area is beautiful !,1
totally awesome !!,1
a must see at night also when the tower sparkles every other hour .,1
"amazing views , you have to que a while .",1
"we were there maybe 1 1/2 hours , waited for the sunset so we were able to see the city during the day and night .",1
we went through security and entered the tower area where we then purchased two tickets to the summit .,1
i love paris xxxx,1
it was my dream destination when i was a student .,1
it was an amazing building which you can see from many places in paris .,1
must see and the little market in front of it was cool,1
visited here as part of a full day tour from london .,1
"i 'm scared of heights & was very nervous but the view from the top is amazing although the champagne bar is a bit of a none event , still it calmed the nerves !!!",1
especially by night .,1
we went to the eiffel tower but did n't actually go up .,1
"last year when we visited paris we did one of the tours of the eiffel tower which was nice too because you go below ground and learn about how things work and how they run the restaurant , pretty interesting .",1
experience this engineering masterpiece and climb 320 metres above the city of love to see the panoramic views .,1
we had prebooked tickets for a very hot july day .,1
went up both times .,1
"if you can , grab some pastries and have a picnic on the grass in front of the eiffel tower .",1
i would rather the attraction close than risk anyone 's safety .,1
to see the eiffel tower in person is fantastic .,1
"we booked a separate tour of the tower so were able to go underneath and to separate bits , great tour it showed you all the behind the scene 's sections that you usually do n't get to visit , how the hydraulics work with the lifts , we went above the restaurant and we also got to skip the queue with the lift yay !",1
paris city tour would be incomplete without it !,1
"must go to the eiffel tower and although people said you do n't have to go to the top , i 'm so happy we did .",1
good value for the money .,1
just magnificent !,1
:p we booked a group tour which was quite interesting as we had a very informative guide ` alex ' .,1
felt like a dream come true .,1
"daytime visit , walking the 669 stairs to the second level , checking out the structure and how this was built in 1887 and still so elegant and structurally sound , reading about how amazing mr. eiffel was , the other things he built , funny that we do n't speak of him more !",1
the eiffel tower was on our bucket list to mark off as this was our 4th visit to paris .,1
"the view was great , but i was glad to leave .",1
"we purchased a -lrb- overpriced , but hey , it 's the eiffel tower -rrb- macaroon and loved it .",1
"whether you are a first time visitor or a repeat traveler , the eiffel tower is an absolute staple for your visit .",1
buying the tickets online ahead of time was the easiest way to do it !!,1
it was a very cold windy day but we enjoyed the view of paris from up there .,1
the only down side are the pushy peddlers that seem to have taken over the walkway under the tower .,1
walked several miles to the tower .,1
is the most known french symbol all over the world !!,1
"the tower gets very busy as the day goes on , so earlier in the morning is best if you would like to go up the tower and avoid cues .",1
a lot of people illegally selling rubbish statues .,1
everything about it is wonderful .,1
visited couple of years back .,1
"they over-achieved , and we appreciated everything .",1
"go early , and of course , no other words need describe the incredible experience of being there .",1
there are 2 different elevators to take you to the top and it is so awesome to see the city of paris from this view .,1
i 'm afraid of heights and made it up there to check out the amazing views of paris !,1
it was down for maintenance when i was there so i did n't go up but it was still great !,1
it is so huge from close-up .,1
worth it to wait for the on the hour blinking to happen .,1
one time unique magnificent experience .,1
you can go to the third level can see the whole paris .,1
"we went at night and views were spectacular , i 'm so very happy i fell for this so called `` tourist trap '' !!",1
we went in the evening .,1
"after we got in finally , we found out that our ticket is no good for some of the lifts , so we ended up climbing a gazillion steps - but in the end the view was worth it .",1
"the ever glistening , ever beautiful heart of paris , is the eiffel tower .",1
to se the eiffel tower illuminated is one of the sights you wont forget .,1
"there is a small snack shop which serves creeps and sandwiches , and it is open until midnight .",1
so we decided to hit this at 1045pm hoping our theory would work .,1
"on the whole , it was a wonderful visit to eiffel tower .",1
it 's a fantastic experience - a great way to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary ;--rrb- .,1
lovely lights which constantly change on the eiffel tower in the evening and a place you must also visit during the day .,1
we did a tour for sunset cruise and then night time eiffel tower tour .,1
i will go again .,1
beautiful place ... it 's excellent to admire all the beauty from trocadero .,1
"many excellent vantage points around paris , especially against the river seine .",1
"time is precious during vacation , so do n't waist yours in line , if you can afford to pay a little more .",1
"if you try and book on the official website to much in advance it tends to say fully booked but when i re-checked a few days before i went they released a lot more tickets so you need to keep checking as its a lot cheaper than through agents , they are very strict on ticket timings though as mine was for 3pm and i arrived early at 2pm and was told i would have to wait till 3pm .",1
the view of the city is extraordinary and we did have a fairly clear day for it .,1
the lift takes you all the way to the top .,1
make sure you visit the restaurant and movie theatre on the second stage level as this is missed by those that get the lift to the top .,1
must go back soon,1
we enjoyed both .,1
seeing the eiffel tower for the first time in person is an amazing experience .,1
we expected a long queue but could be worse .,1
by no means do i think parks is a romantic city because the place smells like urine or garbage most times and the true parisians are rude .,1
"but i must say looking at paris from the top gives you a new perspective on how dense the city is , and is well worth the hassels of going up .",1
we sprung for the extra 6 euros and are glad we did .,1
food was good and the view excellent,1
we visited in the afternoon and again in the evening to seethe light show .,1
it 's high enough .,1
"but , it 's a must see at least once .",1
this was one of my favorite attractions -lrb- of course the proposal helped ! -rrb-,1
we went all the way up to the top .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see .,1
cafe on the first floor is good and i could not believe how cheap 2 coffees and a doughnut were -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- .,1
but you can buy a combine ticket for about 12 euros which is worth it .,1
we had dinner here at night to get both experience .,1
this is the 2nd time i took the steps up and down the eiffel tower and i think you get a better opportunity to enjoy the views and appreciate the height .,1
"once we go to the top though , the views speak for itself and was worth the wait .",1
do not forget to go out on glass floor on 1th floor !,1
"as the first time visitor in paris , we could not wait to visit eiffel tower and it was our first stop .",1
what is there to say other than the standard `` a marvel of engineering amazement ! '',1
"went to it , but not up , due to the huge wait lines and prices .",1
the lights / light show begins at 9:00 for five minutes and then runs hourly .,1
i booked on line with fat tire tours and it was an excellent choice .,1
this alone made the trip .,1
we took a small guided tour and our guide was excellent -- booked through viator .,1
queues are long and people are packed to the lifts like sardines .,1
we bought skip the line tickets and were so glad we did ; queues were very long !,1
"so , buy a skip the line tour and be greatly relieved you saw everything you hoped to see from level two .",1
but if you want a really beautiful distant view go to the terrace of the trocadero .,1
then at the top of the hour the whole thing starts to twinkle - so pretty !,1
the views from the summit are incredible .,1
you now have to go through security to just walk under the eiffel tower .,1
there was a very strong wind and for this reason the top floor was closed to visitors .,1
it is a historical landmark .,1
"so , with a little bit of research , we figured out how to take the train from the airport into the city .",1
plan your trip such that you are at the 2nd level of the tower one hour in advance of the sunset to see the view before the sunset .,1
it 's wonderful .,1
you really see that the city planners of paris have done a better job than city planners -lrb- or lack there off -rrb- in most other european cities ; -rrb-,1
seeing it at night is a must !,1
"it is obviously crowded , but definitely worth a wait !",1
and take the elevator .,1
"also , although it displayed that under 24s got a discount , i was refused for some reason ?",1
my respect to gustave eiffel .,1
easily accessible by public transport.people should visit twice .,1
from the top of this stunning piece of architecture you have all of paris beneath you and what a stunning view it is .,1
"we made it to the second level , took tons of pictures , and since you 're high enough , you 're able to get great panorama pics and still recognize and identify the city 's monuments and architecture .",1
"we did the tour to the top of the eiffel tower , which itself seemed completely surreal .",1
"well worth the small queue , but please do n't take your suitcases up with you .",1
"a must see in paris of the many sights , yes it is so busy so prebook your tickets but worth waiting in the queue .",1
of course you have to pop by the eiffel tower for a look and a photo .,1
still an amazing evening !,1
"planned to go all the way up for $ 17 , but you can buy it in two pieces - $ 11 to the second deck and another $ 6 to the top .",1
when first entering paris you can see the eiffel tower in the distance .,1
"all in all , an experience not to be missed as the view is wonderful ... i 'd actually forgotten just what a big city paris is as it 's 17 years since i was last there .",1
i just wish they had washed the windows of the elevator .,1
it was magical !,1
the view is still incredible at level 2 .,1
plan a late night picnic on the grass .,1
2nd time to paris and 2nd time up the eiffel tower .,1
we will definitely return to paris but will never again use viator tour company .,1
"i did n't find a need to go up the tower , i think it is nicer simply to see .",1
my friend was afraid to go to the top but took a xanax and was fine,1
the night visit was much busier and it took almost 30 mins to get through the security and lift queues and get to level 2 .,1
dress appropriately .,1
there is an elevator that takes you to the top of the tower .,1
all of paris lit up below you .,1
i did it and did n't die .,1
the view during the night is stunning .,1
we did n't visit the inside of eiffel tower but visited it from outside and as well as getting excellent view during the river cruise .,1
our 2nd visit .,1
"however , it still gets a 5 star rating because we received an email within a day providing directions on how to get a refund for our tickets .",1
they tried to point to some tiny print on their sign saying this .,1
"we also looked into buying advanced tickets where you show up at a specific time , and of course , thought about arriving at 8:30 am a little before the eiffel tower opens .",1
"the europe cup was set to start two days after our visit , and large crowds of fans were taking the opportunity to see the sights of paris , there is also increased security in place and a perimeter security barrier has been erected .",1
go up it and see paris in a different light .,1
would have been much more pleasant without the addition of massive amounts of alcohol and drunks .,1
we had a great touch with this company .,1
wonderful experience because we arranged for a guide service so we did n't have lines to wait in .,1
"took the lift up , be aware there may b a que even if you have pre booked tickets if lifts are not working .",1
there is a computerized machine pretty easy to figure out .,1
"also , instead of buying souvenirs from the shop at the first floor of the tower , buy them from the local shops near the tower -lrb- use the saved money for some lovely crêpes -rrb- ❤",1
"beware at the eiffel tower of pickpockets and the many other scams around such as being asked to translate a letter and then being robbed , or being presented with a ring that has been dropped and when you take it then being asked for payment amongst others ... there was a spherical ride under the tower and wall to wall people ... but still a must visit in paris !!!",1
"the trademark of paris , you can ´ t miss it .",1
a popular attraction in paris so expect queues and bag searches .,1
it is like a circus !,1
i 'm not big on crowds and of course it was crazy crowded .,1
"ticket was for 5pm , which we were hoping would allow for a sunset view .",1
"a triumph of engineering and architecture , the eiffel tower is firmly rooted by four massive piers into the earth that transition to four soaring eclipses that join at a point seeming to touch the heavens .",1
the view from the top is nice but i found the view from the big wheel near champs elysees to be better .,1
well organised and thorough .,1
its the definition of tourist attraction complete with gobs of people selling little effiel towers .,1
"lots of open space for walking dogs , doing exercises , running and having a picnic lunch .",1
the wiev from the 3rd floor was amazing and worth the money but the crowds - i would definitely not go there on a high season weekend .,1
"having been up the eiffel tower years ago , did not want to wait in line to do it again , but this time went there at night when it was all lit up and `` sparkling . ''",1
we did n't go up as the queue was really big .,1
we decided to go straight to the top .,1
decided to book the tour to above the waiting time .,1
"as we entered the city on a rainy morning , its stately grandeur across the city was breathtaking even contrasted with the grey skies .",1
eiffel tower is an icon so my advice is to climb up on it on foot .,1
we have been to the et many times so this time we thought we just wanted some good pictures and selfies of the et .,1
"i visited the effiel tower twice in my time in paris , the first time in the day it was raining but did n't hamper the experience .",1
my biggest tip though would be to go with a group if you can so you can get tix in advance and get in faster because the lines are looooong .,1
"bitter cold , ok if you like to wait in line , $ 17 for 2 adults and one child .",1
at night time you can see the eiffel night light show at 10:00 p.m.,1
although queues were long the moved as fast as they could !,1
well worth the full tour free ice skating not expensive to eat on the tower security very good no good if your scared of heights historical,1
we loved visiting this historical monument !,1
"we were there on 27th january at 11 am , and it was a perfect timing !",1
maybe better if you have any anxiety to do the evening and see the city lit by lights .,1
we did n't go up but viewed it from the ground .,1
and i loved it .,1
just to look and to go up and see the city .,1
"if you do this , you can see the both sides of paris : -rrb-",1
i booked our online ticket few months ago .,1
long lines so definitely go online and buy reserved tickets well in advance if you can .,1
pay to visit the summit for 17 euros the view from the top is spectacular and the light show at the top of every hour for five minutes is something to see .,1
it 's not that exciting and trying to get space on the elevator down is a disaster .,1
"we arrived about a half hour before sunset , were able to take great photos and then by the time we got to level 2 it was dark and paris was all lit up !!!",1
the view is also very good .,1
first time i seen it i had that `` wow '' face on and that never changes .,1
this was tiring -lrb- if you have small children and the line is n't to bad i recommend getting the lift -rrb- .,1
stick around for the lights to twinkle on the hour .,1
"however , you should book in advance because the queues are a little overwhelming !",1
if you want to enjoy going up than it is highly recommended to go by stairs up to 2nd level -lrb- 600 steps -rrb- .,1
go straight to lift .,1
"we were there during our honeymoon and the food is not what we expected , they serve you both courses at the same time ... the service was terrible and the effort of the manager to made for it was not enough , wouldn ´ t recommend it to my worst enemy , but the place is a must visit in paris .",1
we did this before flying to paris .,1
i believe this is a must for every visitor to paris .,1
terrific views,1
the eiffel tower does not disappoint .,1
you ca n't go to paris without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
our family had only 1.5 days in paris .,1
"come on , you can not go to paris and not go up the eiffel tower .",1
he grabbed my arm .,1
"i do n't like heights , but walking up can be very satisfying , and oddly enough a lot easier than walking down .",1
the towering structure shimmers and dazzles - at times literally sparkles -lrb- some lights flicker on and off during intervals -rrb- .,1
iconic must see ... lite at night from a cafe ... .,1
throngs of people climbing staircase after staircase and then overcrowding onto the viewing platform creates an unbearable stench .,1
"the eiffel tower lit up at night is not to be missed particularly if you 're there at either 22:00 , 23:00 or 00:00 .",1
the hunter museum !,1
"we picked a `` queue jumping '' excursion although it should be noted that in busy periods as it was early august , this option still meant 2-3 hours standing and getting from top to bottom .",1
so maybe look at booking tickets online in advance .,1
queues were hours end long .,1
entry was very simple .,1
"make sure to book your tickets ahead of time , not covered in paris museum pass .",1
book a reservation to eat at the restaurant .,1
paris municipality - plant some flowers !,1
but next time it is a must .,1
highly recommend going both in the day & at night !,1
"there is an option to climb to the middle using the stairs , but you should be in good shape for that one .",1
"it is not for small kids though and the journey will be stressful , but i cant miss it .",1
"the views are good , the wine on second floor is cheap and tastes great after walking up the stairs .",1
which was a shame .,1
walked down rue st denis to the tower .,1
of course it got 5 stars !!,1
the summit is worth the extra cost .,1
we did n't go to the top because of this .,1
"very accessible tour , helpful staff , no queuing euro 4 for wheelchair user and one carer up to second stage .",1
a must when in paris .,1
was there at the weekend and it was cold !,1
#iloveparis,1
we hired this tour using trip advisor ´ s partner - consival .,1
it 's such an icon of the city and it can be seen from miles around .,1
this may have been the best decision we made of our whole trip .,1
we only went to the second observation deck .,1
the champagne bar is a nice touch .,1
you need to get your tickets a head of time online .,1
make sure you allow plenty of time to visit here if you want to go up and come back down without feeling rushed .,1
so off i went to another queue .,1
yes you can negotiate with those souvenirs sellers .,1
"after this , it needs to be destroyed but it became the symbol of the country .",1
the lift takes you to 2nd level and from here you need to change elevator to go to the summit .,1
we went up the tower around 1000 and found it to be not too crowded .,1
"now being married , i would love to take my husband there .",1
"beware , outside tower ladies with clipboards asking if your english.they ask you to sign then beg / harass you for money.was told by the guide they work in gangs and try to pick your pockets",1
very beautiful and worth the long queue .,1
"the late afternoon ticket , around dinner time , meant it was not terribly hot when we were there in august .",1
history of famous wars and victories .,1
souveniers are crazy expensive around this site .,1
you have to go visit this when in paris .,1
paid extra for fast pass but line-up was n't long .,1
once back down we waited for 22.00 where on the hour the tower lights up for 5 minutes .,1
when myself and my partner arrived at the tower it was mobbed ... and i mean mobbed !!,1
"we did not get any fast-pass vip tickets but they are probably worth it , i waited about 45 minutes .",1
the best views of the tower are form trocadero .,1
"even better , arc de triomph is free for students .",1
check the hours of operation .,1
absolute must see in paris !,1
could n't believe how big this level is and saw the film and wandered around the gift shop etc. .,1
very pretty .,1
you do n't have to go up .,1
our guide got us past the line and upstairs quickly .,1
i would also highly recommend visiting the souvenir shop located inside the tower - the selection of merchandise is great and prices are comparable to many other souvenir stores in the city .,1
its iconic and friendly .,1
so beautiful and iconic .,1
just be careful there are a lot of not so good people around who would like to take advantage of your inattention to others .,1
queues for tickets mean waiting for an hour plus .,1
there 's useful audio guide that makes the visit more interesting .,1
i really enjoyed our visit to the eiffel tower .,1
amazing views of paris - also enjoyed the glass floor experience .,1
"based on my experiences , i thought seeing it at night was the most special .",1
there 's no doubt that the eiffel tower is a crowd favourite !,1
"it 's quicker to get up , and cheaper , and the view includes the eiffel tower !",1
you get a very look at all the innards of the tower .,1
crowded .,1
it 's probably better to go up at night so you can see the city lights .,1
great location a little expensive but worth it once in your life .,1
planned to visit eiffel tower on june 28 .,1
do n't leave the area without taking a family selfie with the tower above you !,1
we were part of a small tour group 7 persons and sat together for lunch .,1
sometime they also close the top floor in view of huge waiting @ lift .,1
please visit when in paris -,1
go to a market to buy the makings of a picnic and enjoy the sparkling of the tower every hour while you enjoy your food and wine .,1
"you must go see the eiffel tower , even if you do n't make the trip up the stairs or elevator to the top !!",1
it truly is one of my favorite places in the world .,1
"i have been to paris before , but have never been up the tower until this trip .",1
the views from the tower are amazing and the engineering feat of the tower itself is interesting .,1
there are also a couple of shops where you can buy light food items and macaroons .,1
you ca n't be in paris without visiting the eifel tower .,1
you can see whole of paris from the top .,1
"plus the incredible views from literally inside the eiffel tower -lrb- which is why , by night , it is much better -rrb- .",1
ah what can you say about the tower .,1
"the signs about pick pockets are there for good reason , it 's easy to focus on the stunning view and not your handbag/pockets and in a crowd , just be vigilant .",1
"there are fabulous 360 degree views of paris but if you go in winter -lrb- as i did -rrb- , wear thermals and bring a thick coat as , if it 's windy , it gets very cold up the top .",1
"been here both through the day and of the night both were absolutely amazing , the café is also delicious id recommend the hot chocolate :-rrb- also to anyone afraid of going to the top level do n't be its an experience you will never forget !",1
but loved the experience .,1
we have to wait for about 30 minutes to reach the ticket counter and pay in cash .,1
"it was a rainy , windy and cold day but i did n't care , i still walked around the area , it was great .",1
incredible views .,1
you get to walk around the structure and get a bird 's eye view of the different parisian attractions .,1
it was easy to get to from our hotel .,1
"the day we went it was absolutely freezing , but the view was worth it .",1
that 's what we did and it was so much more fun not having to wait in the line in the burning heat -lrb- or freezing cold in our case -rrb- .,1
if you are in paris for a few days try and go on the day with the best weather for the ultimate view .,1
"it is a great monument , well worth seeing .",1
"never miss it , when you are in paris .",1
"visited eiffel tower on 29th jan ' 16 , and as expected this kept our eyes open with amaze .",1
i do n't need to recommend this to anyone .,1
everyone should see at least once in a lifetime .,1
spent almost 4 hours there including lunch in 58 tour eiffel .,1
"we visited on christmas eve , just a few months after the attacks on paris and even though security was high , we felt very safe with military and police walking around .",1
"the best time to visit the tour eiffel is at sunset , , just a few minutes before the lights will start flickering and illuminate this incredible tower with magic .",1
"if you cant , it 's ok , just seeing it its nice",1
enjoy the views .,1
we were able to go to the summit .,1
highly recommended to anyone visiting this wonderful city !,1
a must see place .,1
we lunch at 58 eiffel tower restaurant .,1
i love the fact that all the main sights of paris that a tourist wants to see is easily within walking distance of each other .,1
"we thought when we walked to the eiffel tower today that we would see more soldiers and police than tourists , but that was not the case .",1
we only had to wait a while as we went with viator however people waited for hours to go up to see the beautiful sights of paris .,1
"at the middle platforms going up , there are informative totems about the tower and his father engineer , which are very interesting and allow you to recover breath .",1
"i was in paris this weekend and stayed near the eiffel tower , you can see it from such a distance -lrb- we even saw it as we was flying out of paris -rrb- .",1
very scary even you like heights .,1
hold on tight to your bag & enjoy .,1
the eiffel tower dominates the paris skyline and looks as good as you 'd think .,1
although it is hard work and your thighs will burn i am very glad i chose to walk up and would recommend people do the same .,1
we found the view from the top of the arc de triomphe was an excellent substitute .,1
who can go to paris without blowing up the eiffel tower .,1
i booked tickets about 2 months ahead for a time in mid-october .,1
wonderful views all the way around .,1
i would n't spend a whole day here but still it is worth a visit .,1
worth going up at least once .,1
not too many spots for lunch like this,1
had a glass of champagne when we finally reached the top .,1
"i guess i do n't have to write much on this , just get there and take as many pictures as you want , be aware of gipsy around , pick pockets and etc. .",1
i 've always wanted to go here and i was not disappointed .,1
of course it is important to see the eiffel tower at night when illuminated in all its lights,1
"such a busy place to be , but the view from the top would be so worth it .",1
i have nothing to say anymore ... it is really amazing ... only a small advice - the best way to make a lovely photo of the eiffel tower and the city is to make it from trocadero square .,1
service was impeccible .,1
"however , we finshed the tour in the mid-level and had to make our own way to the very top , which did take ages .",1
i liked the displays which explained the history of the eiffel tower .,1
i did not find the cost of either rids to the top to be expensive .,1
arrive with the idea of having to be patient and you will be rewarded with fantastic views,1
one ca n't go to paris without going up the eiffel tower however tickets in summer are very difficult to obtain so do it early and i would recommend the skip the line to the summit tour !,1
long lines but worth the wait .,1
no lines almost no waiting and you have .,1
a visit at night is a must .,1
"the ice cream is excelent and it was lovely to sit , eat and look out over paris .",1
"once you finish , do remember to go by the side lane restaurants and enjoy beer .",1
u should come at nine o'clock in the morning so you do n't have to wait so much .,1
it also on this floor where you take the lift to the top of the tower .,1
"the queues are long , parts of the tower can be crowded , it can be tiring being in such a long queue , then having to queue again for the top .",1
just go to the champs de mars and see it !,1
"nicely organized , impressive feeling .",1
"plan a night view as well , as it is an amazing sight lit up every hour .",1
beautiful night view of the entire paris city .,1
"my preferred time to visit the eiffel tower is at night when it is all lit up , it seems more impressive than during the day .",1
this is the first time to see the eiffel tower in real with my better half ... .,1
"a beautiful human creation , eiffel tower is a must on your visit to paris .",1
but that 's ok for us .,1
much faster to take the stairs though than the endless queue for the elevator .,1
"yes you should plan to get tickets to in advance to go up , but to really enjoy the tower you need to be looking at it not on it .",1
"great view from all levels , food is good also however , the gift shops are over priced",1
do yourself a favor and just buy a postcard of the place lit up in the evening .,1
but when it is lit up at night it is stunning .,1
"you print them off and present them once you are inside , which allows you to jump the queue -lrb- which is usually enormous -rrb- once you arrive at the time you have booked for .",1
"definitely go and if your afraid of heights as i am , you will be fine .",1
lovely in the daytime and breathe taking at night .,1
there is a restaurant and ice ring in the 1st floor,1
breath taking .,1
tour was interesting but not worth the extra 30 euros !,1
people even try to profit off of its glory by selling you wine/beer as you try to sit there and be romanced by paris .,1
the best time to go to paris would be the summer because you do n't have to worry about the cold or rain .,1
seeing the eiffel tower was life changing .,1
the eiffel tower is a very tall tower and you can have a good view of paris from above but it is very cold at the top level of the tower if you go in winter .,1
"if you plan to visit the eiffel tour , this is the best way to go .",1
yet ... it is worth the visit .,1
all in all a good day and worth the experience,1
this is must-see place .,1
in comparison to all the towers in italy it 's basically the same price .,1
something special about this place .,1
a great area for photos of the tower is near trocodera,1
"the visit itself -lrb- not my first -rrb- is worth the wait , as the tower is a truly impressive architectural marvel .",1
breath taking at this enormous monument .,1
the skyline of paris would n't be the same without the magnificent steel tower standing tall to be seen from nearly any point in paris .,1
"i prefer seeing eiffel tower at night , which looks like a sparkling piece of jewelry .",1
was told that without a ticket purchased in advance we would have to wait as much as an hour or more .,1
we spent a lot of time looking at it from all directions and perspectives throughout the city .,1
after clearing security we went straight to the ticket counter and lined up there until it opened at 9.30 am .,1
"if you want to go to the very top , you will need to buy two tickets .",1
it was truly an amazing experience .,1
seeing paris lit up at night from the second floor of the tower was lovely as well .,1
i wish i cud give this attraction more than 5 stars .,1
do n't get caught up with those selling trinkets of the tower or `` genuine '' water bottles .,1
it 's a dream come true experience watching the tower and reaching the summit .,1
the street vendors selling blinking tower souvenirs were tacky .,1
the views of paris are wonderful as well .,1
"we watched ice skaters skate inside the eiffel tower , had a fabulous dinner and climbed the steps for the most breath taking views .",1
the eiffle tower 's construction is fascinating all by itself .,1
we booked a tour online with ` get your guide ' for 52 euros per person .,1
"the only bad thing was all the street vendors selling mini towers , they were everywhere with the same stuff !",1
the better place to see it is from the top of the arc de triumph at night .,1
no flags nothing sharp .,1
"also , go to palais de chaillot to take in the best photographic view of the tower during the day .",1
in addition to this there are people with tricycles -lrb- taxi -rrb- who play loud music .,1
"no doubt , it is one of the most romantic places on earth .",1
i walked across the seine river and watched the tower from a distance at trocadero .,1
what a grand structure .,1
it was rather cold when i visited so i definitely recommend going during late spring and summer .,1
i ordered my tickets before i went best think i did .,1
my husband and i made the trip to the top of the eiffel tower during a trip to paris in december .,1
ca n't go to paris without visiting here .,1
you ca n't not go to the eiffel tower when visiting paris !,1
the whole of the experience is well-worth doing .,1
no hassle .,1
a tip : pre-buy your tickets and be on time for your visit there .,1
who does n't know about this place ?,1
get paris museum pass to avoid the lines .,1
the eiffel tower was n't expensive for entry and we bought champagne at the very top .,1
it was lovely to visit but unfortunately it was cold and windy when we visited -lrb- ca n't be helped - end of feb -rrb- but still so busy !,1
blown away .,1
"i think the price was defiantly reasonable at $ 17 to get to the top in the lift and i only queued for 20 minutes , however you can pre purchase tickets online .",1
amazing place to be in paris and great to have a photo taken with eiffel tower .,1
"kids just loved the lift up , the views , lunch at 58 restaurant on first floor and the ice rink .",1
we went during sun set it did not disappoint .,1
felt safe - do not be put off by armed troops being round - only there for your protection in today 's climate great views and an iconic land mark in paris so a must see and visit .,1
"no queue , just a normal one , so no waiting , not more than 10minutes to buy the ticket -lrb- $ 17 per person all the way to the top -rrb- , got our bags checked and went straight to the 2nd floor with the lift ... then on 2nd floor we got ta change lift to go straight to the top on the 3rd floor , and also no queueing ... from inside the lift u can see outside while u r going to the top ... the view was breathtaking !",1
the views are magnificent .,1
really so kind of the parisians and their treatment of pregnant women .,1
i did not take the tour of the tower as i do n't want to pay extra .,1
wonderful well priced restaurant on level 2 called 52 .,1
any level at night is mind boggling .,1
if you come to paris only once then you have to visit here .,1
no queues to get in but queues at the top to get from lift to lift !,1
no fireworks - but we expected that .,1
"the ques were horrific soooo we went away , came back the next day at 8.30 am -lrb- it doesnt open until 9.30 am -rrb- and we were 3rd in line and the 1st ones on the lift !!!",1
and here 's a piece of advice .,1
don 's miss it but plan your trip early in the day .,1
* do n't turn up early if you do this as you will still have to wait until your time .,1
the day we went the top was closed and so the elevator only went to the middle floor .,1
we had bad luck as the only public washroom on the site was closed for cleaning for over an hour .,1
always busy but a must see .,1
"despite the crowds , we were able to enjoy the intricate details of the architecture and will never forget the experience .",1
i have to say my wife hates heights and she was n't too keen on going in the lift but she did just fine .,1
they have some entrances where you can only walk up steps to a first level .,1
"we rented a flat nearby and had a wonderful view of the tower from our balcony , living room and bedrooms .",1
"so , paris are good .",1
"beautiful , especially at night when it 's all lit up and sparkling .",1
we arrived her on saturday 10th oct after a long wait for the batobus,1
its well worth the visit as its an attraction of paris,1
a must for everyone,1
"frankly speaking , i was a bit disappointed when i had the first look of the eiffel tower .",1
so worth iit and easy to get to on the metro .,1
it does get busy at the best look out points but generally people are conscientious of others and are respectful of taking photos and not taking too long .,1
i felt sorry for the the people queuing .,1
but much improved since visit years ago.went on river cruise and returned to see the tower all lit up !!,1
we ate at 9pm the tower was lite up so was the city .,1
living in paris i pass by the eiffel tower off and on !,1
if you in paris as a tourist this will most likely be on the top of your list .,1
the epitome of french culture and architecture .,1
views were great and even found some nice not too expensive little trinkets to commemorate our visit by .,1
your only concession for dining in alain soulards 58 tour eiffel restaurant is that you do not have to queue to get up there and your entrance fee to the eiffel tower is free .,1
do not miss the light show which is for 5 minutes every night from 11.00 pm to 11.05 pm.it 's incredible .,1
an iconic landmark but disappointing to visit .,1
i went up to the second level which has quite a lot of steps to climb !!,1
"bought the speedy boarding ticket for 2 adult friends , my 7yr old son and i. arrived at the ground floor priority gate 30mins early and was told to wait and come back .",1
i am afraid of heights and did not have an issue .,1
they target then steal.be careful here or go to montparnasse it 's better and no queues .,1
this is the iconic place to visit whilst in paris .,1
there are so many other things to see or visit in paris but those that are mentioned here !,1
"700 steps , but there are plenty of places to stop and get your breath back .",1
we went early in the morning just before opening time to buy the tickets and go up the elevators .,1
we did a `` skip the line '' tour with easy pass tours .,1
"my family & i arrived about 1/2 an hour after the tower opened , we got in the queue for walking up the tower and only queued for about 15 minutes !",1
we visited in the afternoon on a weekday and were able to climb the stairs to the highest stair level without too many crowds around .,1
you can beat the queues by walking up the first couple of levels .,1
the security line is the much longer line vs the ticket line .,1
it is reasonably priced $ 17 per adult to go to the very top .,1
"there are stores and cafes inside to buy souvenirs , but you can find these much cheaper at other stores around the city .",1
injected a little french humor at all the right moments .,1
i mean a lot .,1
words can not describe how it feels whe you see the tower lightening in the twilight .,1
you could always take the elevator,1
beware of pick pocketing .,1
the view from the summit is amazing and not to be missed .,1
if you are in paris and you had n't seen the eiffel tower then you had wasted your time .,1
"also , several people asking for visitors to sign petitions only to have those people become victims of pick pocketing !!",1
if i bought this inside prob would have paid in the region of at least $ 30 .,1
views from the top are mind blowing .,1
a great and spectacular view .,1
here 's a tip .,1
"well , that 's what i still think after the trip in paris , and it will never change .",1
for couple 's vacation i definitely recommend .,1
we arrived 30 minutes early to avoid the crowds .,1
was my first one in paris and was not sure what to do ... .,1
"the views were lovely , it was fairly clear day .",1
paris always will be a top attraction .,1
really great view even at night .,1
its a must see as there is tons happening around it and the views at night are not just romantic but will make you want to spend more time there .,1
it really takes away from the vibe of the place a lot .,1
"it was busy , but it probably took me 40mins to get up there - i did n't think that was bad considering i saved $ 32 .",1
the eiffel tower is an amazing place to visit and a great way to see the city of paris .,1
there was a long line to get on it though .,1
you ca n't really expect anything other than that .,1
make sure to go to the top because the view from its second floor is not as breathtaking .,1
i do n't see the point in not doing so to be honest .,1
to truly enjoy the tower you must visit during the day and evening !,1
an experience for the family mats samaras .,1
yeah .,1
"if you feel like it , take the elevator up to various levels on the tower , i personally did n't do it as i was travelling on a student budget .",1
"also , there is a new 1st floor level surrounded by glass which is pretty cool .",1
"never ceases to amaze with the views , but please ban selfie sticks up the tower !!",1
otherwise everything is smooth and you can spend as much time up there as you wish ...,1
"buy your tickets in advance -lrb- online -rrb- and avoid the long lines , which is never fun .",1
i would highly recommend getting advanced tickets online to go up to the top .,1
"either go alone or with your love , not suitable for family gatherings ; p",1
"especially at night with all the lights , very beautiful !",1
"lots of fantastic pics , i do n't know if they get any better further up -lrb- again did n't wait to get the lift pass on the ground -rrb- .",1
we arrived early -lrb- 8.30 am -rrb- as we were told that there would be long queues later on .,1
i have lost count of the times i have been up the eiffel tower over the years but it truly never fails to please .,1
everybody has to queue to get through security .,1
i 'm not great with heights so going up to the 2nd floor was as high as i wanted to go .,1
we headed to the entrance at our time slot and we 're straight into the lift .,1
"we had deliberately chosen to go up at night , having done the montparnasse tower during the day , but by the time we had purchased our tickets and gone up to the summit to enjoy the spectaculars views , some of the refreshment facilities on the 2 lower floors had closed .",1
"pick pockets , junk sellers , water/beer sellers , and just a generally gross atmosphere really ruins the enjoyment factor of the tower itself .",1
go at night and go to the top !,1
highly over rated - looks best when seen from a distance !,1
"not fond of queues and would rather just skip everything and walk to the top but these days , since 9/11 , there are bag checks every 10 metres .",1
i did enjoy seeing it at dusk best right before the lights come on .,1
we had already seen the eifel tower from the top of montmartre .,1
we were in paris on bastille day and the fireworks were amazing .,1
have visited the tower on a few occasions before .,1
took some pictures .,1
some renovation works were being carried out the big field in front of the eiffel tower .,1
you know the eiffle and are probably just looking for a tip or two .,1
up until the point to where he gave me the finger for offering him a drink of water .,1
what a beauty !!!!,1
we 've only been here twice and both times have been very crowded - but of course it is expected !,1
we did not have time to go to the very top of the tower but i heard that it was amazing when the clouds were not in the way .,1
it costs 6 euros for a person so you do not want to miss this .,1
this tour also allowed us access to the third level which was so worth it .,1
"it is packed so be ready , but well worth it .",1
ours was an hush hush visit to eiffel tower first during day light .,1
the wait in the line was not too bad -lrb- maybe 30/40min -rrb- the view was amazing and well worth the climb .,1
the view from the top is spectacular !,1
nice walk to it along the river on a spring evening .,1
she 's massive but beautiful .,1
nothing like seeing paris lit up from high above .,1
we did n't book ahead as we wanted to see what paris offered us -lrb- timing wise -rrb- .,1
we arrived around 10:30 am .,1
"there are lot of fancy tours organized for eiffel tower , but if you are not the one who wants a lunch or dinner in the restaurant on the 1 st floor then you can pretty much do this on your own .",1
took 2 hrs standing in cold and rain outside to go on eiffel tower to the top .,1
city of lights .,1
i love it more with each visit .,1
"walking up you are overwhelmed by the sheer size and scale , climbing the stairs you get and additional perspective of all that must have been involved building this massive structure .",1
absolutely breathtaking !,1
it has three levels and they are all great .,1
what can one say about one of the most iconic attractions in the world .,1
worth every penny spent .,1
"once in , there was more waiting but once we got up to the top , it was well worth the wait .",1
it is amazing !,1
"visited at night , and it was amazing !",1
:-rrb- what a view !,1
it was amazing to see the eiffel tower hand in hand with my hubby - i was overcome with emotions .,1
"if you go to paris , you have to visit the eiffel tower .",1
you will need to visit during the day and then come back in the evening when the tower is lit up like a bottle of champagne .,1
"even better , walk or make your way by taxi or night-bus in the middle of the night when it 's a dark tower of iron .",1
talk a walk from the trocadero down to the eiffel tower -- great views and no extra expense .,1
we were asked to exit the tower at around 11 pm .,1
"well , you wo n't know whether you will regret or not unless you visit this place and then tell yourself you will regret if you did n't .",1
nice to see all other high rise structure on earth being compared with this tower of love .,1
"i especially like it when there is special lighting , like last evening when it was lit up in the tricolors in honor of the victims of last week 's terrorist attacks .",1
the scale and scope is simply awe inspiring .,1
the architecture is beautiful at night and daytime .,1
ignore them and walk on .,1
a must see/do although you get the best pictures walking up to it -lrb- not being on it -rrb- .,1
the 700 or so stairs are really quite easy but you do need to buy another ticket for the lift to the very top level .,1
i still can not believe that we got the chance to have finally visited the eiffel tower in person last month .,1
if in paris this is a must .,1
this is the big one .,1
horrible experience would not bother,1
the tour was good but the best part was going up the eiffel tower .,1
"the views were breathtaking from there , but there was a long wait to go to the very top , till some people had come down .",1
"beautiful , amazing , spectacular !",1
i will say the eiffel tower is extra special at night when the lights twinkle .,1
you must visit the eiffel tower if you go to paris !,1
seeing the eiffel tower in person is such an awesome feeling !!,1
nice experience though bit disappointed by the management of the queues and lift operation .,1
walking to the second floor only costs 5euros and the views are ace .,1
beautiful view over the city from the top and stunning at sunset from the bottom of the tower .,1
the downside was the many vendors along a narrow walk from the rail station to the tower ... like going through a gauntlet of money-seeking hawkers !,1
"unique view , unique moment to celebrate the life and to celebrate it in one of the best city in the world !",1
walk across the river and view it from the hilltop .,1
"if you arrive without a ticket , you can stand in a long line to climb the tower .",1
"the queues were long , very long & the so called security checks were a complete joke .",1
do n't miss this one .,1
there is nothing like seeing all of paris from the top of the eiffel tower .,1
bianca was top notch .,1
we went all the way to the top and loved it .,1
there seemed to be less people around 5 pm .,1
we went in the night at 10pm to see the illumination of paris that is eiffel tower .,1
it did spoil the experience a little to be honest especially as a lot of the queuing was outdoors and it was raining at some points .,1
"i always go to the tower to spend the extra time i have , so it never gets old to walk around the tower .",1
we did n't have a skip the line ticket but it was a tuesday morning so the line was really short .,1
the view is incredible from the top .,1
early morning meant the crowds were limited and you could get a view of paris from the top .,1
standing below and looking up through the framework always inspired .,1
"we did n't intend to go up , but the queues were reasonable and we decided to pay 11 euro each for the lift to the second stage - the third stage had got too busy and they had closed it but for 17 euro this would have been possible when open .",1
as i suffer with vertigo i could make it to stage 1 but no further .,1
we had booked a behind the scene 's tour of the tower .,1
what a gorgeous view .,1
you can also enjoy the park that the tower is placed .,1
one of the most romantic landmarks .,1
grab a coffee at the top for 3 $ .,1
it 's is so gorgeous .,1
"the eiffel tower is not , for me the best part of paris , it looks increasingly like something that should be removed , compared to other landmarks in the city it does not do it for me .",1
i did n't mind it though !,1
we wanted to have dinner but it was fully booked so definitely book in advance .,1
"my only advise to those who wish to visit this incredible monument is to do it on a clear warm day so once in the top , the views are fantastic .",1
i suppose it is a nice visit and a must see for us touries ... but it is a problem to see all the people hanging around for a opportunity to sell cheap stuff to the tourists .,1
"december evening might not have been the best time to have visited this iconic monument , it sure was n't disappointing .",1
you 'll go and tell everyone about it .,1
it offers a tremendous 360 degrees perspective of the city .,1
we were disappointed .,1
with crowds queuing on a cold december afternoon i was inclined to think my picture from the park would suffice .,1
some young men offered us bottles of wine but we declined and went back to the street and in through the correct gate .,1
going to paris and not going to the top of the eiffeltower ?,1
we made a reservation to ascend the eiffel tower and saved a considerable amount of time entering .,1
do n't miss this .,1
we had a clear day and the views of paris were gorgeous .,1
using skip the line was the perfect ticket .,1
"even though i suffer from pretty severe vertigo , i was able to `` mind over matter '' this one but only lasted a very brief moment at the top .",1
for a family i think this was overpriced .,1
i was really disappointed by this .,1
it does not disappoint !,1
"if we did n't get out the lift at the level 1 on the way down , we would miss the glass floor and mid-air garden , and experience walking on the stairs .",1
"see it by day , see it by night , see it often !",1
tip : go first thing when the tower opens .,1
"definitely get your tickets on line before the visit , or be prepared for some monstrous lines .",1
brilliant views superb information .,1
"yes , lots of fencing and barricades , security , and bag searches to get in which as one reviewer pointed out is an eyesore , but at least it 's relatively safe to visit this landmark !",1
it 's awesome .,1
love seeing the tower day and especially at !,1
the restaurant was excellent .,1
fantastic steel construction of eiffel but many african sellers which was poisonous and they want to something for you .,1
"if you do n't want to spend the 11 euros to go to level 2 , spend some time in the park areas surrounding the tower .",1
it is eiffel tower feeling .,1
the thrill about the eiffel tower is just the fact that you 're there looking at in person .,1
we went 2 days after the nice attack so unfortunately the tower was n't lighted that weekend -lrb- in solidarity with the deaths -rrb- .,1
"great view , great atmosphere .",1
the fireworks show was stunning .,1
it 's a quick ride s d the lines move quickly ... and a highlight for my boys .,1
it was recommended to me to go to the line for the stairs only .,1
go at night and definitely go to the top .,1
i can die now ...,1
"if you have been there before , admire it from the many locations in the city where you can easily view the tower , but do n't get up close .",1
it kind of wrecks the experience .,1
"on my 4th visit , my husband and i went up to the second floor climbing the stairs .",1
"amazing view of the city and if you want to use the telescope , it accepts 1 eur or 2 eur coins .",1
we waited too late to purchase skip the line tickets from the official website even though it was still a whole month before our trip .,1
"if you do go up , be sure to go all the way to the top .",1
make sure you mail your postcards form the post office at the base of the eiffel tower .,1
access was easy .,1
amazing views of the city .,1
parks around are lush green .,1
"when you think of paris you think of the eiffel tower , but it was a lot bigger than i expected .",1
so if you can avoid it in the rain do .,1
i 'm afraid of heights but i did go up to the top with my sister .,1
the best views are from the top of notre dame and from sacre coeur .,1
magnifique !,1
you get to see the most spectacular of the views .,1
"its base is square , measuring 125 m -lrb- 410 ft -rrb- on each side .",1
just doing it yourself is easy and much less expensive than getting `` head of the line '' tickets from viator .,1
"some may say it 's not `` cool '' to love eiffel tower so much , but i will always love it .",1
we toured the seine rode the boats and had a great time shopping the food in paris is great .,1
whent up at night and was greeted by a lovely view .,1
and it was worth it .,1
does this place really need a review ; - -rrb-,1
it was all wonderful .,1
seeing the tower itself is beyond amazing .,1
"since the queue to the lift can be considerably time consuming , make sure you book your tickets on line weeks in advance .",1
i did n't know that there was a little apartment up there that george eiffle would stay sometimes .,1
after your visit take a stroll around the area and enjoy paris .,1
while we did not go up to the top this time -lrb- have done that a couple of times in the past -rrb- - we did go to the eiffel tower .,1
a must-see monument whilst in paris !,1
even if it is just a quick visit without going to the top it is worth a visit to realize just how big & awesome it is .,1
staying close to eiffel tower so ran around the park around it .,1
there is an air of romance there .,1
you can see the entire city of paris and all the surroundings of the seine river .,1
"lines to take the elevators were huge , but it is worthy .",1
thankyou !!,1
although i personally love the eiffel tower i think going too close to it is n't worth it .,1
"waking under the tower is fantastic experience , lots of people here .",1
the lifts have a set operating time so you can stand in lines for ages - better to walk !,1
we have spent our 20th wedding anniversary in paris and it was amazing experience and enjoyable experience .,1
if your in paris you ca n't pass on the opportunity to visit and take the ride to the top .,1
"the eiffel tower is of course an outstanding landmark , one that you must visit at least once in your life .",1
"the eiffel tour is the number one mile stone in paris , and it 's worth it !!",1
there was no need to worry .,1
a beautiful place in winter but in spring it will be soooooo romantic .,1
we managed to get to the front within 15 minutes and after that was another quick security clearance before we took the lifts to the top .,1
"someday , i will return to paris and will walk happily around and beneath the majesty of the tower , but wo n't feel a compulsion to head to the top again and would rather spend the extra time visiting another part of paris .",1
so do n't waste time trying to find the lift .,1
"no matter where you stay in paris , or how long your visit is , be sure to spend some time at this landmark .",1
tour 51 restaurant is the best .,1
it is great from the top but its advisable to choose a sunny day .,1
and to get down again 1 more hour .,1
we bought tickets online and got up to the second floor .,1
"despite being warned we should book ahead , we pitched up at the eiffel tower without doing so .",1
you are not in paris if you have n't been to eifel tower .,1
the trick is to arrive very early and so avoid the long queues and crowded gardens that you 'll experience if you are not an early bird .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see during your trip to paris .,1
an amazing sight and worth the climb if you feel fit enough .,1
"this is a must see when in paris , the views are spectacular and there is surprisingly shops , cafes and other things in the tower",1
perhaps maybe because we went up at night .,1
"it 's well worth a visit to just go and see it , take some photos and walk around the park , but you do n't need to go up to enjoy it .",1
you can take the subway and get off on arc de triomphe .,1
i had visited eiffel tower last year in the month of september .,1
"i had champagne at the top ... it was my 40th birthday , it had to be done !",1
"less than 1 hours wait at around 2 pm on a wednesday , you buy the tickets right there .",1
"the key is to simply concentrate on one step at a time , breathing and counting , and look down at the steps , not at the sights as you are climbing .",1
we were lucky with short queues to walk up to the first level .,1
need to watch out for the beggars and pick pockets the only negative .,1
"did n't expect much , been to many tall towers to get a nice view .",1
it did n't ruin the trip .,1
view from the top is just amazing .,1
"it was a windy , cold day but it was amazing and beautiful .",1
to long of a wait .,1
the statics of this monument is mind boggling in its enterity .,1
an amazing experience from beginning to end the food was fantastic the view was just ok .,1
my 4th trip to paris and i finally made it to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
when you think of the eiffel tower you think of paris !,1
recommend to go early to get through security .,1
great vistas !,1
to view from afar make the effort to visit at night on the hour when the tower lights twinkle .,1
i will never forget walking out of the metro stop and walking towards what i thought was the direction of the eiffel tower .,1
"she is a stunning piece of wrought iron lattice work and the few from the tip top , even on a blustery march day is incredible ... but ... and i hate to write this ... she has been disneyfied and is exceptionally overcrowded .",1
and thh view of the tower from afar at night was stunning !,1
a very good place to stay when in paris .,1
"the views from the top are amazing , however if you want stunning views of the eiffel tower itself , id recommend going to the top of le arc de triomphe .",1
security very strict as you would expect .,1
"definitely worth going to the top , views are amazing .",1
also be aware that there are a lot of buskers in the area and watch your purses and pockets !,1
"standing at the very top is one of the best feelings in the world , and highly recommend it .",1
there are areas on the first level that have glass so you can see below .,1
"there was a car that caught fire underneath the tower , but it was not related to any act of violence like in nice , it was just a mistake due to faulty fireworks , i believe .",1
we went to the summit and it was worth the money .,1
best time to visit is in the evening / night when the lights are on !!,1
walked up the stairs to the first level .,1
"there is a restaurant , cafes , and souvenir shops .",1
"seen on a clear day in december , it is always an incredible sight .",1
"paris , the cosmopolitan capital of france , is one of the largest agglomerations in europe , with 2.2 million people living in the dense , central city and almost 12 million people living in the whole metropolitan area .",1
"when i was there , one of the lifts broke down causing up to be shuttled over to the other working lift .",1
who goes to paris without the fabulous treat !,1
the ticket costs 7 euro to the second floor and 6 euro for the elevator to the top floor .,1
"also , even if you 're afraid of heights ...",1
the views are spectacular and it really ca n't be faulted as an experience .,1
eiffel tower is a must go in paris .,1
it was a cold october afternoon but the view from top of trocadero gardens overlooking the tower was simply breath-taking .,1
the weather was amazing and skyies were clear .,1
stop by the park on the way in and grab a little snack and just relax on the lawn and enjoy the beautiful view before you head into the tower .,1
i was so excited to see paris and the eiffel tower for the first time that i burst into tears when i had my very first view from the taxi !,1
beautiful torre eiffel .,1
i went to the eiffel tower with my girlfriend who had n't been before -lrb- and i had been once as a child -rrb- .,1
do n't use this operator for your eiffel tower visit .,1
what can you say except wow .,1
this was one of my bucket-list that i needed to accomplish during my short visit to france as it was postponed many times because of the security concerns and i managed to do it .,1
we arrived - no line for security and 10 mins line for immediate entry tickets !,1
i 'm not impressed .,1
"just to stand and look at the amazing structure , even ride up inside it for a beautiful view of paris makes the visit worth while .",1
it 's a magnificent structure and you really feel a sense of history .,1
a short flight of stairs then takes one to the fresh air of the very top .,1
"great photo opportunities and do n't forget if you have your loved one with you , take a ` kiss ' photo at the top !",1
"busy , hot and expensive - we managed to get a tour of the eiffel tower and the queue jump which in total cost is as a couple that # 97 .",1
"we have been to paris a few times but has never been close to the eiffel tower , so this time we decided to go there .",1
very little information on the destination and although it was meant to be a seine tour as well we were told we could do it that night or within a year .,1
"during the day it looks very ordinary ... just an iron structure but in the night when it is lit up , there is a huge transformation .",1
"it 's the eiffel tower , so of course you must go up it !",1
the final ascent to the top is by elevator only and you can purchase an add on ticket to ride the elevator .,1
where to begin ... just a beautiful place .,1
views are amazing though .,1
"lines to get in are long , however we were able to avoid them by making a reservation to eat at one of the restaurants up inside the eiffel tower .",1
"long cue on the line going up , the park within the area is ok but sometimes there are annoying souvenir vendors .",1
"only did it because , how can one go to paris but not visit the eiffel tower ?",1
the views are just magnificent .,1
it cost us 14.5 euros to go to the very top by elevator .,1
"expensive , but how often are you going to do this ?",1
of course the eiffel tower gets 5 stars it 's the eiffel tower !,1
security 1 was a joke 4-5 people chatting amongst themselves .,1
the tower has flashing lights on the hour after dark .,1
bargain !,1
you can purchase tickets once you get there .,1
the elevator is the way to the top with getting all hot and sweaty by climbing all those steps .,1
even in the morning fog it is a sight to behold .,1
the structure is so beautiful that it was nice to have time to admire it .,1
i had read that there is often an ice skating rink on level 1 in winter and much to our 10 year old 's delight it was true !,1
busy the day we toured so did not go up to the top .,1
"since they had to wait for people to come down before allowing the rest of us up , we had to wait about 30 minutes for the tickets to be available and there was little respect for the line .",1
"very impressed , was actually higher than i thought .",1
everyone must see the eiffel tower but a real treat is to go there at night when it 's lit .,1
if you intend to go to the summit you need to pay,1
only one elevator was working .,1
"also , important to choose when to visit as some hours are really packed and it can destroy the experience .",1
"we went in the morning to watch the sunrise , but it was too cloudy .",1
"the experience , the food are superb , wines are really nice .",1
i almost tripped over one of them running me down to sell me a key chain .,1
"be careful for arabs , they want to sell you everything you can only imagine!the queues to eiffel are very long but you can not visit paris without being on eiffel tower !",1
"it was reasonably priced , being later on in the evening we did n't have to que for long .",1
it 's quite an experience to climb up the metal structure .,1
i have been to paris several times and never been up the tower because of the queues .,1
at night the light shows are spectacular .,1
while i was walking toward it .,1
"on the other hand , it was very cold at the top during march so i recommend coming in the summer .",1
"i booked my ticket for 11am , however , as i was there early , i decided to try and go up early , but they would n't let you through until 5 minutes before the time on your ticket .",1
felt security checks were very good and felt safe .,1
we were bothered by cheap souvenir folks which was annoying but ignore them and they will go away .,1
with another observation point sacré-cœur basilica give full paris view .,1
seeing the eiffel tower for the first time at night i was sceptical of what i would find but to my amazement the tower looked magical !!,1
my gf and i stopped there 2 times while we were there once just to look at it and the second time we went up into it .,1
beautiful to see whether it 's day or night but we really enjoyed the light show at night .,1
you must go .,1
it was such a great experience .,1
"every hour on the hour , -lrb- at night -rrb- it sparkles for 5 minutes , definitely recommend seeing it then .",1
definitely .,1
the stairs will give you access to the first and second levels .,1
it is very memorable .,1
"as expected it was crowded and costly but we loved it ... seeing so many people of different nationality , food stalls offering variety of cuisines , playing music , it was like one big party at the same place contrast that to seeing almost no one in winters .",1
the eiffel tower really is a feat of engineering to behold .,1
the top is nice to see the view of paris from but it just was n't worth it for us to wait in the long line and feel so crowded .,1
"it 's such an iconic sight , if you 're anything like me you 'll never forget the first time you see it .",1
"even though it was rainy and cold , we enjoyed our visit to the eiffel tower .",1
went for my 21st birthday and it was excellent .,1
"long ques to go up the top , but if you book online you can pass by the mass crowds , .",1
pack a picnic lunch .,1
"the lines can be quite lengthy and we bought the skip-the-line tours from city wonders -lrb- also well worth it especially for the interesting history behind the tower and its creator -rrb- , but later on in the evening the queues do thin out .",1
"better to book online in advance , so you do not have to queue for the tickets .",1
"it was very interesting to just sit and look at the wonderful `` iron lady '' with all the tourists around , and marvel at the fact that she was only meant to be up for a couple of years .",1
visited eiffel tower during daytime .,1
"not so bad , but if you do n't like being in a crush of humanity , you wo n't like it .",1
that was fun !,1
souvenir shops are expensive .,1
there were lots of scammers hanging around and we had to be careful with our bag but it is certainly a beautiful place to visit .,1
you have to go on the top at the night .,1
"the champs de mars , the field in front of the eiffel tower , was not what i expected , more worn down from the high traffic .",1
go erly or late to avoid the crush .,1
"of course it 'll be a lot less crowded in the morning , so schedule your visit accordingly .",1
its expensive but if thats not a constraint there is no better way to see the top,1
must visit in paris .,1
"this time i had the opportunity to travel with my family ; my wife , and three sons , 15 , 12 and 9 years old .",1
"for such a monumental landmark - very well priced and very well organised , we decided to walk as much as possible then lift up to the very top - the view really is as unmatched as its cracked up to be",1
"the eifel tower gives great views over paris , if you are able walk up the first few levels , it saves hours of queuing , oh and hang around if you can until 10pm as this is when the tower gets illuminated , a great spectacle close up , also look amazing from the arc de triomphe .",1
just missed getting tickets to the summit as they stop selling at 11 but a great experience none the less .,1
"we booked too late to do this , but found got in with a tour group and our guide was good .",1
you can see all the big structures in the paris city and the experience is wonderful .,1
"climbing up the stairs was fine , you can rest in between and read about the eiffel tower .",1
they were still available through tour operators but at 3 times the price so we opted to just turn up and queue .,1
there was such bedlam and chaos and confusion there with people getting inline and pushing i do n't see why it wouldve mattered anyway .,1
"the wait line for the elevator went fairly quickly and it probably was 1-1/2 hours total for the entire visit , including our time at the top .",1
"however , the most enchanting and addictive activity is to go up the tower in the late afternoon and witness how paris changes its colours during sunset and becomes a starry land with sparkling lights on the tower close to midnight hours .",1
there are a couple of places around paris for good views .,1
"also , i 'm deathly afraid of heights so if i can make it to the top so can you .",1
very romantic and just amazing !!,1
it was a clear day and we truly `` could see forever '' .,1
"it was an exhausting day with the combo , but well worth it .",1
"sure it is touristy , but the views are great .",1
fantastic views over all of paris .,1
what a structure .,1
"i am afraid of heights , i get sweaty palms , head aches , racing heart beats and feel dizzy but there was no way i was going to let that keep me from going to the very top !",1
the views are amazing and you experience the sway as the wind moves the tower around slightly .,1
we ended up visiting it at a time when there was literally no security line and the ticket line was maybe 10 minutes .,1
on the way up the stairs we stopped to take in the incredible views and to get a breather .,1
the wait is definitely worth it .,1
"also , be ready to be cramped when going up the elevators , too !",1
"now it represents paris , its elegance and modernity over centuries .",1
tour eiffel was on our list and it did not disappoint .,1
you will get through much quicker if you travel with a tour guide .,1
very little wait time .,1
"we had concerns about visiting the tower over both suggestions of long wait times , heavy security and also my wife using a wheelchair due to limited mobility .",1
i noticed a lot of visitors not bothering to visit the first floor however .,1
really worth of visit .,1
recommend to wear a jacket on the way up as it 's really cool and windy up there .,1
kinda scary for some !,1
so disappointed .,1
we stayed for a few days and it rained everyday but it was all worth to see the eiffel tower .,1
it 's a global icon of paris and for good reason .,1
it 's a lovely place to be .,1
"probably nothing , so i 'll just say :",1
as always i recommend fast primes for the best images .,1
"was a highlight of our stay in paris and even went at night to have a look at the light show , recommend that as well .",1
"it 's a bit crowded up top , so go when crowds are down , and if you go at night , bring a good jacket !",1
"all in all , probably spent 1 1/2 to 2 hours there .",1
"we walked around it plenty , then off to the top we went !",1
"we encountered no lines on our mid-week , end of september visit .",1
"very busy but a joy to visit and great to see the security around to make you feel safe and secure , well done to the staff .",1
"after learning a lot about france and its landmarks , my daughter -lrb- age 8 -rrb- and i made sure we went to visit this awesome building .",1
would recommend arriving early - we arrived around 9.30 and only had to queue for about ten minutes .,1
we just arrived at the eiffel tower and had no real plan except to climb up this iconic structure .,1
"another thing to note is there are at least two entrances open at a time and for whatever reason , a majority of the people went to one side which left the line light and short for the other side so keep you eyes open and look for the shorter line !",1
would n't bother again with guided tour .,1
the tower is an amazing piece of architecture & surprisingly attractive .,1
being to paris and being on eifel tower .,1
i really do n't like the architecture - not my style .,1
it has long queues but if you wake up early and go there before the gates are open you would fin yourself in getting a better place with just a few minutes to wait while being one of the first to go up that day .,1
"never the less , hordes of tour groups jammed the place , cutting the lines , and causing general chaos .",1
just a marvelous day and we just ca n't describe how massive the structure is ... truly breathtaking .,1
best of everything in terms of the view !,1
the `` customer service '' representative was kind and printed a new set of tickets for us .,1
but it is well worth it .,1
"make sure you get there early as security checks add to waiting time , in common with all paris landmarks .",1
later than 10:00 or 11:00 am the fog lifts and the views are less spectacular .,1
great views of paris from the top ... the crowds are a bit much and it does take quite a bit of time to get to the top .,1
most romantic place i ever visited .,1
the tower itself is lit up fully & once every hour starts to blink .,1
"we booked a guided tour with viator and so pleased we did , we avoided the queues with a priority pass and our guide was excellent !",1
after viewing from this level you can purchase an add on ticket to ride and elevator to the second level or continue up the stairs with no extra charge .,1
went to the eiffel tower for a couple of hours .,1
the huge structure and amazing engineering left me mesmerized .,1
the worst aspect was that the whole grounds badly needed a cleaning - there was litter all around the eiffel tower - such a shame in such a remarkable city .,1
and i planned to visit the place again with my kids to see the nost famous place in the world !,1
"even early in the morning there was a queue to get into the area , to get through the first security checks , which were slow and rude .",1
be prepared for a line to go down .,1
we booked a tour with city wonders for a seine river champagne cruise and tour of the eiffel tower at night .,1
i has seen it on tv and in pictures many times but the sheer size of it when you actually experience it in real life is incredible .,1
i have enjoyed visiting paris many times and always walk over to this spectacular sight .,1
full of tourist security makes for long lines .,1
the harmony of the people from various countries is visible here .,1
"had lunch , walked around and took some photos .",1
i could only imagine what the views from the very top would be like !,1
during the night the lights are on every 20 ' -30 ' for about 5 ' and the whole tower sparkles .,1
it was a 5 star meal with a breathtaking view .,1
it was a wonderful walk .,1
we decided to go anyway and bought tickets right there .,1
"we decided to skip going up the tower , choosing instead to climb up the arc de triomphe .",1
not worth the waste of time .,1
go directly to the summit if you have the summit tickets and soak in the awesome views .,1
i also went in the fanzone -lrb- female with teenage daughter -rrb- .,1
and it looks even better at night .,1
"so , on this visit , we took the metro as close as we could and hiked the rest of the way , and just wandered under the tower , and the park grounds .",1
lovely glittering lights ... nice place to spend an evening with your loved ones ... we were there to spend our 1 aniversarry and it was so worth it,1
"if you climb to the top , avoid foggy days and bring warmer clothes because it 's chilly up there at night .",1
"absolutely stunning , particularly at night with all of the flashing lights .",1
arrived by metro at trocadero station and walked down and across the river to the eiffel tower .,1
to expensive and to much effort for frankly an unimpressive view from the top of the tower,1
it is also on the riverside of the seine -lrb- 塞納河 -rrb- .,1
it is an unforgettable experience .,1
no one comes to paris the first time without stopping here !,1
going up in two different elevators is fun .,1
i was a bit disappointed with the eiffel tower to be honest .,1
food is amazing !!!,1
"you can have the day view from the top , then leave for the city tour after enjoying an icecream on the siene side and come back in the late evening .",1
"it was not busy the day we went , so no long lines .",1
having been a few times over 30 years it never ceases to amaze and delight .,1
"i came here and queued for 30 minutes , before collecting tickets .",1
well worth it though as the views at the summit are even more spectacular .,1
"we then took the second lift to the top and there is a circle where you can see paris from that height , but you stay indoors .",1
you can get some great pictures outside .,1
"the view on the top is wonderful , we can see the entire city .",1
the first time i visited was in the 1970 's as a teenager on a school trip .,1
both stages can offer you a good view and nice spots of the city .,1
champagne at the top is very costly -lrb- e 15 per small glass -rrb- .,1
there are also people selling small eiffel towers which you can buy as cheap or cheaper in legitimate stores .,1
"visiting eiffel tower in the evening is refresher to your eyes , the sparkling of the tower at every hour is like stars are shining in the sky ...",1
and we did n't even walk or ride to the top .,1
"walking to the first floor is great , but i can advise you walking from floors one to two has resulted in me being unable to walk or sit down - take the lift !",1
"if you are in paris , you must visit it at least once .",1
would like visit again some day and actually take a ride to the top .,1
i have been to paris several times and i always go to the eiffel tower because it is certainly one of the greatest wonders of the world !,1
"otherwise , the tower itself is stunning and we loved visiting .",1
lots of illegal street vendors .,1
"the palais l'homme , the grand palais and the city architecture is are so beautiful .",1
"afterwards , you can then continue your visit of the tower having had a good meal and avoided the queues .",1
there are many warnings to be vigilant for pick pockets .,1
best views are on the 2nd floor ... seriously !,1
"we decided to up by stairs instead of the lift , and i advice to go this way .",1
the police come in they run away and then they come back once the police are gone .,1
paris so dirty at the summer .,1
see it in the daylight but well worth going back to see it at night - and be there `` on the hour '' so you can see what they do with the lights .,1
quite interesting exibits at the top of the tower .,1
"we went up to the first 2 floors as the top was too busy to go to , but enjoyed it all the same .",1
tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels .,1
"we did n't go all the way to the top -lrb- locals recommended a different view of the city for us -rrb- but we spent an hour here , easily , just admiring it 's beauty .",1
"however , be prepared to wait .",1
we walked away taking lots of photos .,1
the musement tour just got us in the door and left us in a massive crowd .,1
second time in paris and just had to see the eiffel tower again !!,1
visiting the eiffel tower was exciting as well .,1
"there is truly a feeling of unity , of fellowship and , yes , that we all truly have the ability to respect each other no matter what our nationality ma be .",1
there is a restaurant on top as well .,1
"if you 're planning to climb the stairs , please note that those close much earlier in the day -lrb- around 5 in the summer -rrb- .",1
only went to the 2nd level which was high enough for us .,1
visited on a sunday evening it was pretty amazing loads of people different side attractions the lightening it was totally amazing but it was too crowded for me to go up,1
"i 'm terrified of heights and managed it , you can take the staris to the 2nd level on the same ticket -lrb- about 8 euro each -rrb- .",1
we stayed very close by so after each excursion we walked back past the eiffel tower and never got tired of the view .,1
once in a life time experience .,1
in the summer ticket queues are very long .,1
"we booked a trip to paris at the last minute so could n't buy tickets online for the elevators , but instead decided to climb the stairs to the second level .",1
but gradually the interest in eiffel twer deepens when the history and technology of building this marvellous landmark is known and even more when the relevance of the tower in the context of paris in different phases of history particularly world war 2 is understood .,1
the descent down is easy .,1
this also gave a goo look at the infrastructure .,1
a lovely walk by the eiffel tower .,1
"bit scary if you do n't like heights , but still doable .",1
"worth a visit at both day and night time , the night views are spectacular .",1
i ca n't imagine the lines on a beutiful day .,1
"ordinarily , the lines are long , and the ride to the top is expensive .",1
the eiffel tower was my first stop and it was well worth it .,1
definitely the way to do it .,1
"the tower itself is stunning , although is always a crowded area .",1
i would like to do that on our next trip .,1
"after all the events that has occurred over the past year or so , makes you feel safe and secure with presence of the france police .",1
my wife and i are in our 50 's and in decent physical condition and we chose to climb the 669 stairs to the second level .,1
she is really incredible .,1
if you are adventurous -lrb- being fit helps too -rrb- you can try the stairs .,1
"well , if in paris , how could you not visit eiffel tower right ?",1
"br careful when you get into the lift as a few people have had their fingers pinched , also beware of pickpockets",1
i would highly recommend visiting the eiffel tower if are ever in paris .,1
it was very dusty in some of the garden areas but the side closer to the river was a bit nicer if you want to have a picnic .,1
"also , the most accessible metro station is trocadero .",1
"we timed our visit at sunset , enjoying daylight and night time views .",1
we decided to celebrate the first night in paris by enjoying the view from the tower .,1
no matter what you may have heard the la tour eiffel is a must visit at some point during your stay in paris .,1
this must be visited day and night .,1
so in the sunlight awful but in the night it was beautiful .,1
the eiffel tower is something everyone who visits paris sees .,1
"it is wonderful , iconic , impressive !",1
saw the tower by day and by night and was equally impressed at the beauty .,1
we thought it would n't twinkle until 10:00 pm but very excited to see it happen at 8:00 and every hour .,1
we could see the top 1/3 from our room .,1
"visiting eiffel tower without a pre-booked reservation -lrb- which takes weeks , if not months , to book in advance -rrb- can be a nightmare .",1
took the tour to the top which we booked online in advance .,1
everyone knows of the eiffel tower but to walk up the stairs and see the magnitude of the city below is priceless .,1
one must visit this place while in paris .,1
the eiffel tower was bigger than j expected and the view from the top was just sensational .,1
"after visiting the summit , come down to the lower level to get a different perspective on the sites .",1
from 2nd floor you can easily walk down to 1st floor and then ground floor .,1
booked online prior to departure so access was straight in with absolutely no delay .,1
"we invested in a skip the line pass , well worth it .",1
having priority access you will always ahead of the crowds .,1
it 's a totally different perspective .,1
champagne bar on summit pretty expensive but funny .,1
the top of the eiffel tower was beautiful .,1
a one off and a great experience .,1
"since our ticket included entry to the top level , we decided to wait in line and see the summit -lrb- which is truly a wonderful experience -rrb- .",1
"got into the cramped lift as the people packed themselves into every possible space , and nervously watching the lift weight meter .",1
apart from having a panoramic view from level 2 and level 3 one should not miss to have a glimpse of the sculpture of the mentor of this great tower eiffel at the bottom near the entry to lifts to level 2 .,1
see it in the day and return to see it at night .,1
not for the fain hearted .,1
paris is synonymous with the eiffel tower so it 's a must on a trip .,1
grate place to visit .,1
"take the tour at the eifel tower in daylight , eat nearby , and enjoy the view of the tower from the ground after nightfall !",1
"that said , it was very beautiful .",1
"on a side note , they had a giant soccer ball hanging in the middle of the tower for the euro tournament that was going on .",1
the views from the top at night were magnificent - i 'm sure they are just as magnificent during the day .,1
metro station short walk away for easy access .,1
"a lift is required to the 3rd level , but it is included in the ticket -lrb- hang on to your ticket -rrb- !",1
it is iconic and you will not regret it .,1
went up eiffel tower twice the last time we visited paris in november .,1
see it .,1
when we asked the staff what the issue was they said it was their mistake and is was played in error .,1
we were thrilled that we would be at the summit after dark .,1
a little disappointed during the day time .,1
great warmth !!,1
the eiffel tower alone is reason enough for me to come back to paris !!!,1
if you do n't know what this landmark is or what it offers you must have always lived in the woods or a cave .,1
the tickets lines are long .,1
it costs 17 euros per person,1
i love this amazing structure !,1
its one of those things you want to say you did .,1
we saw all of paris from the tower .,1
no need for that now,1
didnt have pre booked tickets and had to wait about an hour on a random wednesday afternoon to get our tickets .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see sight in paris .,1
the only bad thing is the vendors selling trinkets and selfie sticks all over the place .,1
"my husband and i booked last minute with a tour company offering a package deal that included a jump the line for the eiffel tower , the louvre and a boat tour .",1
queues not too bad on the friday afternoon we visited .,1
"with illumination , it looks beautiful in the night .",1
i thought i 'd visit the tower just to know for myself what it looked like .,1
we purchased our tickets a month in advance online .,1
it is well worth the price .,1
check it out after you know the history .,1
the gods threw everything they could at me .,1
"the best time to head up is just before sunset so you can get a glimpse of the city at three different times of light -lrb- daylight , sunset and nighttime paris -rrb- .",1
this is a must do on your bucket list or if your visiting paris .,1
"i still get a thrill , myself , from the view of paris on a nice , but cloudy , day .",1
"eiffel tower is a must see , especially with the sparkles at night -lrb- on the hour -rrb- .",1
not to miss the spakling lights at night .,1
"when the lights come on , the tower is beautiful .",1
"it was really windy , could feel a bit of a sway .",1
"my 3rd visit we decided to go all the way to the top , luckily there was champagne up there ... .",1
as part of our party my sister in-law and i are afraid of heights but that did not stop us from visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"we got prepaid and organised tickets through a local company which saved us time even in january , it was busy so i 'd hate to see it in summer .",1
we had paid for 2nd level tickets and it was n't overly busy early feb. .,1
eiffel tower is such a recognizable landmark its worth all the queuing you need to get to the very top .,1
there were a few people around but largely we had the brilliant and beautiful views of paris to ourselves .,1
"views from all the floors spectacular so do n't worry about getting up to the top , unless you like to climb stairs or do n't mind a crowded and rather claustrophobic lift .",1
try booking the summit tickets online to skip the line .,1
the views are good but there 's not that much to see .,1
first - avoid the lines !,1
think we paid # 15 .,1
pretty much had place to ourselves .,1
mind your wallet and the queues at the loo !,1
just make sure you go in the lift as the stairs are a killer !,1
beautiful to see in daylight and glamorous at night .,1
the eiffel tower is not to be missed .,1
we had prebooked tickets for a trip to the top deck of the tower .,1
well worth the visit to this icon .,1
walking line was about 20 minutes .,1
it 's so worth a see so make sure you get to that summit : - -rrb-,1
"good points , views and iconic status = a 5 review",1
we had purchased tickets about 3 months ahead of time hoping we would not have to wait in line so much .,1
"for those who are afraid of heights , enjoy standing up or walking across a small section of see-through glass - a new innovation for this recognizable iconic structure .",1
"the last time i went to paris , i climbed the eiffel tower with a colleague .",1
recommend ignoring all advice to go early to beat queues .,1
"did n't go up it as queues were too long but it is a sight to look at in the night , especially on the hour when the lights make it look like it is glistening .",1
after descending the tower slowly we watched the light show from the bottom .,1
purchased my tickets online which i highly recommend .,1
this is arguably one of the most iconic structures in the world .,1
not expensive at all and the views were amazing !,1
would advise pre-booking .,1
pay for the full ticket so you can go all the way to the top .,1
"but , too many people .",1
a romantic paris icon indeed !,1
"i think there are travel packages and group tours that bypass the usual lines , and they are worth the $ $ for the time you 'll save .",1
"however , as many beautiful parks and gardens there are in paris , i do occasionally like to visit champs mars sprawled out with a nice picnic and good book .",1
worth seeing and we did n't book - we just went early and managed to get tickets fine without queuing for too long .,1
"pretty crowded normally , so you will need to spend some time in the line .",1
world attraction ; but very difficult to enjoy .,1
the views of the tower from the ground or the water are so iconic ; especially at night when it 's lit up .,1
it is magical !,1
"walked in the park to first see , then went back on tour !",1
excellent place .,1
you ca n't visit paris without going to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
spectacular views of the city below .,1
very beautiful .,1
someday i 'll return to have dinner .,1
"whether you go up or just stare at its beauty , it 's a must !",1
the eiffel tower looks truly mesmerising and even more magical when it is lit up .,1
using a tour to skip the line was worth it .,1
long security lines but little security .,1
do n't bring much with you because you do have to go through security .,1
going in the winter is great because there are no lines .,1
visit at night is very romantic .,1
"take any angle the view still awesome never miss this place , enjoy the view and if have extra euro make an reservation to dine in the restaurant voilaaaaa .",1
do n't forget to check out the painting of ` endless sleep ' on the ground below -lrb- see my pictures -rrb- .,1
there,1
"we went to the top , it was misty but worth it .",1
it was super crowded but worth it to take in stunning views of beautiful paris .,1
the line for the tower is a bit long but eventually you get there .,1
cause during the day there 's lots of people and you can not take good pictures .,1
make sure you go in then evening on the hour to see the lights sparkle .,1
absolutely not ... first time in paris you must do it second time you know what to expect but third time trying mine luck with top absolutely not ... .,1
it was windy at the top but the views were worth it .,1
photos can be captured all over the city and she stands tall 24/7 .,1
"if it 's your first trip to paris , i 'd recommend going to the summit .",1
the guys selling stuff was a bit of a nuisance .,1
"merci , paris !",1
"in no time we were on the second floor taking in the views of paris , a great photo opp - took lots of selfies - lol .",1
be there at least 45 minutes early if you have a pre-purchased ticket and be prepared to get in line once you 've passed through the initial screening at least 15 minutes in advance of your entry time .,1
"please be careful of people hanging around you here we was forced into paying $ 20 for two cheap cotten bracelets off a man that came over and just put these on our wrists , there was also people in bins and some very odd people just wondering around .",1
there are lines to get up to the tower .,1
amazing views of the city 360 ' at night from the river cruise is the best view in my opinion the flashing lights that have been added since i was last there were spectacular .,1
spent a great amount of time in the champs de mars overlooking the eiffel tower .,1
there was a lot of rubbish and i did n't feel safe having the armed police everywhere .,1
omg what a walk ... over 900 feet ; but it was worth it .,1
i took pictures for one guy who wanted the reflection of the eiffel tower in his sunglasses which turned out really cool .,1
"security is tight , but they get people through quickly .",1
leave plenty of time for a trip to the top in case you do n't get as lucky as us .,1
"my seventeenth time to the tower summit , the wait was reasonable despite the recently expanded security measures .",1
found our way to the first stage lift and had to wait in a hot room inside the leg of the tower for the lift while some actor who you could not hear gave a brief history talk about the tower in english .,1
the main restraunts close at 02:00 so reserve or take your chances if you really want to go .,1
"it is the line to get up the tower , so if you are in peak season i would recommend buying a ticket where you can pass the lines - we had one of these and went right up to the elevator and passed a lot of people in a line that probably was an hour long -lrb- the elevators are not that large -rrb- .",1
its magnificence is just standing proud and erect right there .,1
"for 1030 on a saturday night it seemed pretty crowded up there , but the view was worth it !!",1
"if one wants to see the eiffel tower , do it @ night .",1
it 's a must visit place .,1
you can save some of the time waiting or queuing as they call it in europe by taking the stairs .,1
"anytime i see the tower from any other part of the city , i know where i am .",1
"we went by bike , so there were lots of bike lanes so very accessible .",1
paris was loaded with tourists and there were many people waiting on line at the tower .,1
i just missed the lights on the tower by a few minutes as they shut off by 1.00 a.m. .,1
once in the tower we did not have to wait long for the lifts .,1
it will be crowded !,1
what can i say about this attraction .,1
weather started off poor but by the time we reached the top visibility had improved .,1
"needless to say must , must visit while in paris",1
"no matter how many times you see it , you ca n't help but be spell bound by the remarkable structure .",1
"the engineering and artistry in this structure leaves you speechless , that is until you get to the top and check out the views of the entire city and beyond .",1
really amazing view .,1
"this is truly a must see experience , even if you have to stay up late to enjoy it , and brave the transit vagaries this summer .",1
i 'm not sure what to say .,1
everybody goes here so it 's a busy place !,1
"some people do n't realize there is the option , so even on a rainy day you can go up -lrb- though the raindrops on the window will show on your pictures in the enclosed area -rrb- .",1
i miss her all the time,1
we walked over at night and it is truly lovely to see .,1
if you are young and energetic go all the way up to the top .,1
always bring a coat as its cold up there .,1
"it 's a sight to behold , especially from below and looking straight up .",1
"stunning at night , magnificent by day .",1
was amazing to see the eiffel tower in real .,1
the lines were very long and it was a hot day .,1
you can watch it for hours .,1
make sure to buy tickets to go to the top .,1
the tower is just as beautiful as you dreamed it to be .,1
we were n't actually planning on going up the tower but we took that chance .,1
to be visited atleast once if in the city of love !,1
"we had visited eiffel tower with friends in april and had a complete tour to the top of the tower , we paid 17 euros per person and it was worth paying it .",1
we visited on a tuesday morning so lines moved quickly and were quite short .,1
dreamy .,1
make sure to splurge and pay to take bother elevator tot eh op .,1
amazing experience to climb the tower all the tour is really good the views you can see over there is just unbelieve we took the night tour and is so recomendable pictures record experience good vibrations,1
"what an amazing piece of architecture , hats off to the creators , you should walk down the stairs to get the feel of it and you should watch the night cracker show for sure .",1
if you go to france you have to go to the eiffel tower .,1
the sight of paris were just amazing .,1
"so , many , selfies being taken hahahha .",1
there is an option to go to the top !,1
beautiful views on the way up and once we got there we were able to take our time and have a good around .,1
what we did n't expect was the lack of staff to keep the crowds controlled .,1
better if you book your ticke tin advance to avoid the queue !,1
it was surprisingly a lot easier than we thought and we 'd walked up to the second floor quicker than we anticipated .,1
we did not have to wait for two hours on line on that rainy day .,1
try to go up the eiffel before sunset and stay till sunset .,1
had to queue for sometime but the day was warming so nice being in the sun .,1
"only at night starting from 10 , first five minutes of every hour , the sparkling lights are tunred on , adding an amazing effect to the beauty of the tower .",1
but keep an eye out and have an exit strategy .,1
we were there 1 dec and bought tickets to the summit at the ground level of the eiffel tower .,1
"one of those places you really want to see , both at night and daytime .",1
then when you come down you must stop at the restaurant level .,1
this is a must for a first timer in paris .,1
both in day and night time .,1
it was a lifetime experience being in that place with the awesome view .,1
"as the sun set , and the lights came on , i was drawn to the monument like a moth to a lamp .",1
prior to leaving australia we purchased ` jump the queue ' tickets .,1
"after we finished and moved over to the opposite bank of seine , there was a brief spell of rain and at the end of it we were treated to a great sight ... the golden eiffel , shining as the late afternoon sun basked it -lrb- see the photo i uploaded -rrb-",1
wonderful tourist spot .,1
worth every bit .,1
secondly it gives you a real feeling of how high you are and you can see the views all the way up not to mention the workings of the tower itself .,1
there is something in that steel structure that brings great excitement .,1
daytime crowds are terrible and you 'd spend the better part of the day to ride an elevator .,1
you are just simply skipping the line to purchase the ticket .,1
"impressive , cold steel structure , beautiful .",1
long lines to get in but worth the trip to the top .,1
definitely see at night as well .,1
"we took one easy flight of stairs down - about 350 of them - slightly slippery , holding the railing .",1
"awesome place , love the views .",1
worth the wait which is long .,1
we have been several times - in the height of summer on a clear day is probably the best time .,1
the top was n't accessible that morning .,1
the show starts at 8:00 pm and then every hour on the hour with the last one at 11:00 .,1
of course the views that it offers are unbeatable !,1
"make sure you look at the tower from both sides , specially if you want to take good pictures of it .",1
"i only got as far as the the second stage , was up here for roughtly 2hrs gave up waiting for the intermediate & third stage .",1
"okay , so it 's the eiffel tower with an amazing and unique view of paris .",1
great view from the trocadero gardens .,1
"on my first trip to paris , i thought going to the eiffel tower would be so cliche .",1
had prebooked for 11 of us to have dinner at 58 restaurant in the tower .,1
how can you go to paris and not see the eiffel tower ?,1
we went straight through .,1
which is a bit claustrophobic .,1
so think about going late afternoon as it seemed less busy then,1
however it was satisfying to be there & see it for real .,1
the only thing you 'll actually see here is long lines and people illegally selling trinkets .,1
good way to work off all the irresistible french bread and pastries .,1
we went up on a sunny day and wee glad of the cooler air at the top .,1
lift back down to the second floor .,1
we took the elevator to the second level of the eiffel tower .,1
toilet facilities are basic but staffed beneath the tower .,1
you can never satisfy yourself even if you spend couple of days visiting the eiffel tower as it is a monument worth visiting any number of times .,1
must must go .,1
it is still the screen for my daughter 's phone .,1
just spectacular !,1
2nd level cafes and viewing areas very pleasant .,1
"it 's beautiful , especially during the night .",1
tickets were sold out online from the official site .,1
the tours are overpriced and the staff was not very kind .,1
the experience is crowded .,1
"the lines can be long , but honestly , it is totally worth it .",1
not nice in bad weather .,1
night-time is special as it lights up but daytime you can see the stunning architecture and design of the tower .,1
the sight from the top is great and cheap to access too .,1
especially during the night time .,1
we did a group tour with a company called paris city vision .,1
"during the evening , the eiffel tower lights up !",1
"it 's a tower , a big metal tower , an amazing feat of engineering for its time !",1
the views were spectacular !,1
times .,1
best viewed from the esplanade du trocadero area between the palace & museum .,1
"lift only every 10 min or so , and very busy so make sure you leave enough time to get back down if on a schedule .",1
"it is of course a must visit and to go up in the levels of it is completely worth it , you get a view from paris which is amazing .",1
highly recommend seeking out the steps of the trocadero for an unobstructed view .,1
my son and i took a night champagne tour that include seine river also .,1
the next day was clear and there was a waiting line for over an hour in bitter cold .,1
wonderful view of paris and the river .,1
the dream place of many .,1
the eiffel tower really needs no reviews as it stand on it 's own '' as one of the ca n't miss must do 's in paris !,1
he explained each area of paris we could see from the top .,1
lines were fairly long but well worth the wait .,1
absolutely breathtaking at night time .,1
also have performing ponies and a huge snake in show !,1
every time i go is like the first time !,1
... in the world ?,1
perhaps the easiest review i have ever written .,1
"under the current circumstances , paris is on high alert .",1
just ignore them .,1
however we decided not to pay the money to go up we wanted our pictures that have a view of the eiffel tower in the background .,1
"plus , if you are in paris you must go to their most famous landmark once or you just did n't `` do '' paris !",1
no introduction or compliments can do justice to this majestic monument .,1
amazing view of paris city and gardens nearby .,1
i was in paris during the orlando shooting and i had the pleasure -lrb- albeit bittersweet -rrb- to see the eiffel tower light up in rainbow colors in honor of those who fell and have many people from around the world brought together during such a tragic time to watch with .,1
my tickets were for 4 pm sure it was busy but we walked by at 10 am and the place was empty.a bit more security would be nice .,1
here 's how to do it right .,1
you will be constantly harassed to purchase a little eiffel tower from the hundreds of guys wandering around trying to sell them ... every 3 minutes you are asked by another sales guy .,1
we went to the top and found it to be extra special .,1
i really feel the eiffel tower is overrated ... the day we were the lines were very long and only one lift was open .,1
nice gift shop .,1
the view is amazing and worth it .,1
they do not have tickets .,1
if not you will wate for hours ... .,1
take the stairs .,1
we were walking from louvre to eiffel in the afternoon .,1
got the $ 17 ticket to go to the top and managed to see the view through the sunset and into the night .,1
i stood there for about 30 to 40 minutes .,1
lines to buy a ticket .,1
do not go during high season or during the weekend since queues are too long .,1
there were also pushy trinket vendors everywhere selling things - just soliciting tourists over and over .,1
different angles and different experience .,1
"food , service , view !!",1
do it all the way up .,1
"in the night it was very bful , it felt like there were sparkling jewels on the tower .",1
"when you first arrive , there is one cue outside that you have to go through for security in order to enter - when we arrived here at 8:40 , the cue was not insubstantial .",1
on the way down you should go to all the levels .,1
it 's stunning up close .,1
"if you can walk up the stairs , i recommend it !",1
"be aware of online selling tickets , they are overpriced .",1
"i was lucky enough to be there during a france euro 2016 match , which france won and the lighting on the tower was just mesmerizing .",1
the day we visited was the day of the euros so was pretty hard to get in due to security -lrb- which was fine rather them being careful ! -rrb-,1
getting in involves hours of queueing and once you 're in its just * more * queues to go to the top .,1
we had lunch at one of the little cafes in the tower which was reasonably priced .,1
this is the eiffel tower .,1
"also , the tower lights up at 10:30 pm for like 3 minutes , then you wait another hour .",1
"it is always a memorable experience to go to the top of the eiffel tower and this is the fourth time i have been up recently , each time with a different grandchild .",1
it was amazing to do and the views were amazing .,1
"my wife and i went to the top of eiffel tower , enjoyed a glass of champagne , enjoyed the panoramic view of paris .",1
waited 2 hours to get up .,1
i like it best when lit at night .,1
definitely recommend .,1
the sparkling tower radiated joy !,1
beautiful views of paris .,1
"the queues to go up the tower are long and persistent , so we opted to sit on the grass below and watch instead .",1
"we did not have reservations , but we only had to stand in line a short time .",1
it is very close to several other sights and the views from the top are definitely worth it .,1
they are not bothersome .,1
ny café people were very accommodating - highly recommend that restaurant .,1
the only trap is to misstime the lift .,1
we made our way to the first floor where our guide purchased our tickets then took us to the second floor .,1
but when you see it front of you you have nothing else to do but admire it !!!,1
great value for 24hr visits .,1
the cost of this tour was great and it provided so much inside information which made it so wonderful .,1
and there 's even a post office up there to send a postcard !,1
i recommend the elevated view from palais de chaillot when the construction is finished .,1
we enjoyed the city view from the 3rd level as well as 2nd level .,1
would definitely come back to see it again !,1
a memorable image of beautiful paris .,1
it was raining when my appointed time came .,1
"due to the late timing of our visit we decided to go up the tower on foot , which was really rewarding as we actually felt every step in our feet .",1
"my wife always wanted to see the eiffel tower , and now she has .",1
it is also worth waiting on the hour in the evenings to watch the strobe lights bring the tower to life with twinkling lights .,1
we booked before you go and i would recommend this to everyone otherwise you 'll be in a queue for at least 3 hours .,1
been 4 times now and the queues have always been endless so still have not been to the top !,1
pre book restaurant dining to avoid disappointment .,1
"the views were spectacular , especially on a clear day .",1
i 've been in paris three times and up the tower twice .,1
the restaurants around seems to be a bit over-priced .,1
make time to see it at night - even if it 's from a distance for the light show .,1
the elevator to the very top was closed for work although i 'm not sure i would have gone all the way .,1
in january the top is closed for repairs and also because of the weather .,1
amazing views of paris for 17 $ .,1
our whole family loved this experience and a visit to paris would not be complete without going up this impressive tower .,1
top tip ; pre-book your tickets to avoid major queues .,1
had champagne at the summit and jus a great life experience while on honeymoon .,1
and inexpensive .,1
love effiel tower .,1
one point i want to mention this structure looks best at night when the lights started to glow up on every hour .,1
"amazing experience , at just 17 euros each it was a must while in paris .",1
the light show was something i 've never seen before .,1
beautiful views at night and sooo romantic,1
a good way to see the layout of the city .,1
stunning piece of history .,1
during summer .,1
standing under it and looking up at this massive steel structure will leave you speechless .,1
this is the new ruse that is all the rage in europe to make you pay much more than the attraction costs in order to get in .,1
stand in the middle of the tower and get a feel of the paris vibe .,1
do n't miss the third floor .,1
"unless you buy online , you have to queue to buy a ticket , then queue to go through security , queue for the lift to the first level -lrb- unless you decide to walk -rrb- , then once at this level you have to get out and queue again to go up another lift to the very top .",1
we stayed in the area with beautiful views of this gorgeous tower walking to see it was a lovely stroll lining up for tickets did n't take long good policing in the area hardly any drama from gypsies we enjoyed a crepe after going up amazing view just the most lovely day do n't miss this,1
do n't miss the light show that happens for five minutes starting on the hour every night .,1
booked the behind the scenes tour to avoid the massive the lines and it was worth it !,1
be prepared to que for an hour or so,1
also well worth taking the elevator to the top 3rd stage which has truly spectacular views right over paris and beyond,1
the views were very good but it was very windy and difficult to walk .,1
i walk past the tower and spent some time in the area below .,1
u would think the money the tower is raking in they could afford to clean them .,1
we visited the eiffel tower some ten days ago and at first were fearful of the queues to get in .,1
a tip is to buy your tickets months in advance if you want to go to the top .,1
great views from all over paris !,1
"as you get closer , you admire the artistry and design even more .",1
it was just too crowded and dirty for me .,1
walk to the 2nd floor do n't wait for hours for the lifts .,1
the view of the city from the top of the tower as well as the experience of chill there is worth the time spent in queue .,1
"of course it is sad to see the poverty , and that is what they count on .",1
it was an amazing experience but it was so windy once we got to the top we could n't stay very long .,1
glad i visited though .,1
climbing the different levels of the tower and enjoying food and drinks in the restaurants up there are very satisfying experience .,1
paris used to be so clean everywhere !!!!,1
it was 5 euros to walk up .,1
"a must do when in paris , no words to describe just how wonderful it is , absolutely amazing !",1
"i enjoyed our guide through city tours , without him i may have been more disappointed .",1
go early and take the west entrance .,1
i understand there are many people around but try to get your tickets before hand and just enjoy .,1
the whole eiffel tower experience was beyond words .,1
"it does n't last long , but it 's fun to watch .",1
my significant other and i drunkenly stumbled here a few weeks back .,1
"i did n't know how i would react to seeing the eiffel tower for the first time , but as we drove into paris the goosebumps hit us straight away .",1
you will not be sorry .,1
there are few land marks that compare to this beautiful structure ; it was well worth the trip to paris to experience it first hand .,1
"although we decided not to go to the top , the views from the second story were great !",1
do n't miss taking a picture here .,1
the first time we have been to paris ... it 's exactly what we imagined it would be .,1
this is a must when in paris .,1
"loved the headphones they were excellent , lovely and clear .",1
so much bigger than we imaged .,1
then another security check when going up the tower .,1
the eiffel tower was definitely the highlight of my trip to paris and a dream come true for me !,1
i would definitely recommend going up all of the floors ; the third floor is incredible to go up .,1
do each level .,1
they charge upwards of 60 per person to get to the summit .,1
for security/approx .,1
"if your in paris you have to go , right ?",1
"if you go to paris and do not visit eiffel tower , its a sin .",1
we took a big bus tour of paris and the eiffel tower and it was so beautiful to see this landmark up close and in person !,1
"we were able to queue at the disabled and reserved queue , which would have moved even faster were it not for the large number of people in this queue who were neither disabled nor had a reservation .",1
my favorite place in paris .,1
i went there every day and evening .,1
we took the lift up the second level and it was worth it .,1
i do n't like heights and they went straight to level 2 -lrb- highest i have managed -rrb- .,1
you can walk to the top of take the elevator .,1
"if you go to champ de mars via using subway , you ca n't see eiffel until you go up to the ground .",1
after you go up and see the eiffel -lrb- not night -rrb- it was a total disappointment .,1
seeing at night is also a must !,1
it is still a must see and going up in the tower is still impressive .,1
that 's the charisma of eiffel tower .,1
we loved our visit ...,1
the eiffel tower is incredible but it was very busy in the mid-morning .,1
not romantic at all .,1
"from new zealand : all wonderfully smooth ; from nearby easy-to-find meeting point , proceeding through security checks , well informed guide with interesting details of the tower and history .",1
excelent food and service .,1
"only time we need to stay in queue , was when we came down from the sommet .",1
once through security go right to the lineup to buy your ticket .,1
one of the must see & climb wonders of the world .,1
the views are stunning and paris is such an attractive city from this height .,1
only 17 eur to go to the top deffo worth it .,1
after about an hour we got to the ticket booth then had about another 45minute queue to get in the lift .,1
"the blinking lights are turned on every half and hour , and it is absolutely amazing .",1
"on the first level , there 's a lot to see , a restaurant , a souvenir store and several other amenities .",1
my youngest child is 8 and managed it easily .,1
go to the top of the tower .,1
amazing view of all paris go at sunset and stay till it 's dark and watch it light up .,1
you must see it .,1
each level provides magnificent views all across this beautiful city .,1
the day we went it was super busy and all parks around it were closed for the upcoming football cup playoff game .,1
"i get down one level , but still can not get to the bottom .",1
looks stunning from a far in the skyline but going right up to the tower and looking up at it is a must !,1
the highlight of our trip .,1
"finally saw the eiffel tower , so worth it .",1
it will be better if you know the story of eiffel .,1
"if you get the chance , go !!!",1
great spot for picture taking .,1
"we visited here in december and loved it from start to finish , we done it at night time and views were spectacular and i would do it all over again .",1
"i suggest going early , and i went back in the evening .",1
buying and enjoying champagne at the summit was available though .,1
was definitely a highlight of our trip - if there at night on the hour the tower `` sparkles '' - was very exciting to be up there then and hear everyone up there oooh and ahh .,1
i think it is something you have to do if in paris .,1
so there 's no way you are going to miss it .,1
the trick was figuring out how to navigate the crowds .,1
we went back 3 more evenings over the course of our week-long visit and each time was magical .,1
no let me correct .,1
"the views , even from level 2 , were just fabulous !",1
"from the summit , you can purchase a glass of champagne , so if this visit is a landmark , bucket list event for you , splurge on the champagne .",1
good place for photography - and enjoy the strong winds up in the sky .,1
it 's just one of those things you have to do .,1
but the herd of crowd that ends up here wo n't let you become romantic at any moment .,1
"in may of 2016 , my family visited the eiffel tower in paris ... a momentous occasion for us all .",1
"for me , there is no more iconic place in paris than the eiffel tower .",1
"to make the most of your visit , try and visit it twice -- once during the day and once at night and see it changing its beauty from offering vast panaromic view of paris to the glittering jewels of night !",1
the line was much faster when we went as well .,1
there appeared to be long lines of people waiting to go up the tower so i 'd suggest you get there early in the morning and maybe avoid the crowds .,1
much better to order tickets online first so you do n't have to wait in the very long lines.the surrounding area and service by the workers is something else .,1
it was windy at the top though !!,1
book your tickets online to reserve a spot for a time around sunset and skip the purchase lines to go right in !,1
do n't miss the 1st as there is a glass floor which is brilliant .,1
we choosed to go on a week day after easter .,1
take the behind the scenes tour of the bunker and the tower .,1
"can look rusty and old , but there 's a reason indeed if it keeps being so fashionable .",1
"we went up to the 2nd level and then walked down , which is best done on a fine day .",1
i have always wanted to visit the eiffel tower and little did i know i would have the chance .,1
"i was traveling in the train to eiffel tower ... just when i was near my stop i got the first glimpse on the tower from the train and it felt like a dream ... maybe cause i always dreamt of going up that tower since i was a kid ... whatever it was , i loved that sight .",1
this was our first time in paris so we wanted to do a lot of sight seeing and couples things .,1
"this time i visited during winter january 2016 , rain poured early evening which added the freezing cold and windy air up that i cant feel my bare hands holding my camera , though the scene stil spectacular full of bright lights around paris .",1
it really has it 's own feeling with there are n't all the crowds around .,1
"many people , including local parisians , had told us not to bother with visiting the eiffel tower ; however , we went anyway .",1
we managed to source some food and a bottle of wine and sat across the river and watched the lights come on .,1
"amazing view , would recommend , that 's if you do n't mind trecking up and down the stairs -lrb- if you prefer not paying extra for the lift -rrb- .",1
as he insulted us in french we left in disgust not before complaining to the information desk .,1
i opted for the stairs which was a good climb but i did n't enjoy the top view .,1
such a romantic place to visit - we even saw a couple getting engaged underneath !,1
it does get windy though so rug up !,1
that been said it is otherwise a big bore .,1
"if you want to get up you 'll have to wait for a while , but even worse experience is being constantly `` attacked '' by all those numerous souvenir sellers who got quite annoying last couple of years .",1
this is obviously a must see when in paris .,1
highlight of our trip to paris,1
the eiffel tower is a beautiful structure .,1
"pre-booked to go up the eiffel tower on our visit to paris , it was good but not amazing !",1
there are some informal souvenir salespeople below ; ignore them .,1
i was stunned when i saw it for the first time .,1
i would definitely advise to buy tickets in advance so you dont have to make the long line -lrb- we went in december which is not high season and the line was pretty long -rrb- .,1
could not make it to the top but the mid point was worth the visit .,1
but had to miss due to closure of the tower after the unfortunate terror attack .,1
going up allows you to view all of paris as you walk around the observation deck .,1
"i will definitely return , so that i can see paris from the eiffel tower again , but this time , in daylight .",1
it was with every penny,1
the street sellers is really irritating .,1
we heard people trying to sell wine to a couple for e45 .,1
take the metro & get off at the trocadero exit .,1
i feel like i could n't miss this out if i came every year to paris .,1
"we prebooked tickets on line , and skipped the queues , definitely worth it !",1
the weather was so hot and stink smells are everywhere .,1
we really enjoyed the lower platform swings and lovely handmade wooden benches .,1
"where as , on a monday morning it was 45 minutes from queueing to getting into the first level lift , though there was aprox .",1
otherwise an amazing attraction .,1
i loved seing the eiffel tower in all it 's glory .,1
head in late afternoon so you can see it in daylight and night .,1
we decided to go up the tower at night around 9:30 pm .,1
you have lot of vendors in the open area selling tower replicas and key chains but you need to bargain .,1
d / / uk : wir haben im internet eine hinter-den-kulissen-tour bei parisinfo/cultival gebucht .,1
"the eiffel tower is not only one of the most beautiful atractions in the world , it 's also a symbol of peace , of liberty , of willingness , achievement and universality .",1
despite this,1
make sure to have a glass of wine at one of the bistros nearby at night whe the tower is lit up .,1
"we were here in april a family of 5 , well worth a visit we went to the top of the tower and the view across paris was unbelievable .",1
take your pictures and fight the crowds .,1
we still had two weeks left in our trip so i figured i would deal with it when we arrived home .,1
"amazing , just as you would imagine !",1
to avoid huge line up for ticket buy online .,1
the lifts get you to the top no problem and the panoramic views of paris are pretty good .,1
we climbed to the second level -lrb- 670 steps -rrb- where the views were spectacular .,1
walking up the stairs was kind of fun as well .,1
hard to see the views when you are rushed by the tour guides !!!,1
looks amazing at night when the lights go on .,1
"the lines are long and not really worth it , when you can see much of paris from other venues .",1
i would have loved it even more if the crown was not beating the experience .,1
"the views were incredible , even on a cloudy day .",1
i highly recommend taking a `` skip the line '' guided tour .,1
made it till second level and had an amazing view of the city .,1
"this option was cheaper but more importantly , the lineup was a lot shorter .",1
queue 's not too bad this was about 10.30 on sunday morning .,1
it was an amazing view .,1
definitely the symbol of paris ... saw it when it was christmas time and have to say that on new year 's eve with lights in that particular way it was something unbelievable ... charming like all the city !,1
however once there fabulous views,1
"we had a lunch reservation at 58 and they suggested to get in 30 to 45 min ahead , however last week , the line up for ticket holders and restaurant reservations was up to 70 minutes and then you have to go thru a second security screening which might take another 30 minutes so , take your time and patience if you want to get in .",1
"grab some cheese , crackers , and champagne and head to the tres magnifique eiffel tower for a picnic to never forget .",1
"lovely place , there is a park in front where people ait and admire the tower .",1
the first pictures we take every time we visit are here !,1
"we tried to book online , but all the dates appeared to be fully booked for up to one month in advance .",1
i immediately was captivated by the beauty of the iconic french landmark with just one glimpse .,1
timed tickets greatly reduce time in line .,1
"and then as we approached , the magic continued .",1
paris gives a surreal feeling and feels as if you are living a dream come true .,1
this is a definite must see and experience .,1
decided to opt for a night viewing and tour and found it to be a more pleasant experience than a day visit with all the crowds .,1
then have dinner close by ... there are many cafes .,1
this is the best place i ever been.i like it so much.it is a very romantic place.and the view is onderful,1
the view is amazing and at the end of the day it was not very full !,1
it looks smaller the on the photos .,1
i cant wait to go back an see it again .,1
it was cold and the lines were long .,1
beautiful views from the tower .,1
the views are awesome and it 's an experience everyone should have at least once .,1
we did n't book tickets online and the queues were very long so we did n't go up .,1
cross the roads at the traffic lights and you will find this small cafe opposite -lrb- next to a larger more a typical french bistro -rrb- .,1
highly recommend booking a `` skip the line '' tour .,1
plus it also meant that there were less people up the tower so that we could take in the spectacular views .,1
the best view ever .,1
it is really silly to write this review because the instant you see this iconic monument you are awed .,1
there was no prior notice that this might happen so we wasted an hour just getting to the 2nd floor .,1
"the skip the line gets you up to the third floor where you can explore and then take the elevator to the top , which is a must do .",1
"there are tons of pickpockets around , many with the `` sign my petition clipboard '' scams .",1
"security was very tight - 2 bag searches , plus metal detector ... very different from anytime i 've been there before ... lines were long , but there was a feeling of safeness ...",1
and the view was fabulous !!!,1
"we went here today , a the weather was fabulous but the queues were quite long , wished we had bought tickets on line !",1
we went to the second level and the views of the city were unreal !,1
seeing the eiffel tower in person is an indescribable feeling .,1
there a lovely gift shop and a cafe where you can grab a coffee and just chill we loved it .,1
i suggest you buy a ticket online to avoid waiting in the long line .,1
we also recommend going around twilight to catch the sunset and then enjoy the city of lights from the top .,1
there was no better feeling and treat to be taken to the best seat in the house !,1
"security issues notwithstanding , it was lovely to visit the eiffel area and we did this more than a few times without ever being hassled by police officers .",1
save your money !,1
"ca n't see how this review would matter to anyone , because how can you not go see the eiffel tower ????",1
makes sure u book before to avoid the question .,1
excellent !!!!,1
my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our time at the eiffel tower .,1
from the terrace you can see all over paris .,1
security fencing all around which was different to when i last visited in 1990 's .,1
the tower is always brimming with tourists and that makes it not so fun to enjoy the views .,1
the tower is impressive and the views are breathtaking .,1
but from the top is very nice .,1
the view from the top is good !,1
let me start by saying i did not go up in the tower -lrb- maybe it would be 5 stars if i did -rrb- but it is still very worthwhile to see while in paris .,1
how can you come to paris without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"also , be prepared to be knocked around by selfie tourists .",1
"hardly any queuing at all , around 10 minutes to get through the security .",1
especially at night when it 's all lit up .,1
be wary of pickpockets and the touts ard the area .,1
"no wonder eiffel tower is rated as one of the great wonders ... it is a talll , beautiful and rhythmic structure with a perfect backdrop .",1
well done france !,1
an added plus was that we were there on a clear sunny day .,1
and the stairs was not bad at all .,1
it is a amazing experience i would love to go there again there is gift shops restaurants -lrb- quite expensive -rrb- telascopes you can even see a bit of disney land paris,1
the night view is simply stunning .,1
it takes 11 euros to go to the mid level and i went there after reading the recommendation from lonely planet .,1
best view of the city .,1
love how they have all the pick pocket warnings everywhere .,1
we beat the queues and went late at night .,1
"this review is mostly based on the stair climb , not the park in front of the tower .",1
we went straight to the second floor and then we queued for about 10 minutes to reach the summit .,1
it 's beautiful any time of the day or night .,1
it will peek through the streets at you in way that is delightful .,1
"strollers are allowed to go up , so you might want take it with you for your kids .",1
inside is great amazing views,1
we did n't bother going to the top,1
the best place to take pictures of the eiffel tower is at the park nearby .,1
this means you need to leave yourself plenty of time and patience to get through them all .,1
me and my girlfriend visited in february to celebrate 2 years together .,1
"we never paid to go up , just walked around and have no regrets .",1
we were in luck that we did n't have to wait very long to get our hands on the tickets .,1
"i do n't know what it was , but for some reason my wife and i were drawn to the eiffel tower everyday .",1
we visited eiffel tower the first day we landed in paris and boy were we in for a surprise .,1
we had tickets that skipped the line and were also for the summit with its great view as well as seeing gustave eiffels office up there .,1
"after waiting in line for some time to get the tickets , i was n't expecting much ... we were cold , tired , and just wanted to go up , come down and go get some dinner .",1
"we spent a good 10 minutes taking in the scenery and taking pictures , selfies etc. before i looked up and realised there was a second lift !",1
here 's my tip : do not waste your time in paris in the ticket line .,1
"you 're in paris , i mean you have to visit the eiffel tower .",1
recommend a guide to make your visit more educational .,1
to use the elevator was 15 euros i think and stairs was 13 euros .,1
wonderful experience !,1
the area surrounding the bottom of the tower is scruffy and filled with people selling a load of tat - not to mention the infamous pick pockets .,1
the restaurant entrance is quite difficult to find .,1
i so enjoyed the ride up in the elevator and walking around and taking in the spectacular views from all sides .,1
loved each moment on top of it !,1
with gorgeous shops and top floor bar it 's a must to visit - there was also an ice rink for christmas on the second floor !,1
"we only went up to the second level , but there were still fantastic views , it was highly affordable , and virtually no wait time .",1
sometimes the summit is closed,1
quite neat .,1
we got to see the glittery light show and took some awesome photos .,1
has a glass of wine and really enjoyed the views .,1
everybody knows it .,1
"this did cost more 100 $ for the family but once we arrived we were relieved as the queues were enormous , so with a 6 year old were rather relieved .",1
we decided to queue and soon a long queue was behind us .,1
"walking up and down is great for the adventure junkies , otherwise it takes about an hour normally to go up the eiffel tower .",1
"even if you do n't go up , it is impressive to see the architecture and take great pictures .",1
"the lifts are crowded , but when you reach the sommet , go up by the last 1 stair too , you get the feeling the visit was totally worth it !",1
got to see the light show which added to its magic .,1
"we did not , but i watched with jealousy the much smaller lines for those who had made reservations .",1
arrive early on a weekday to avoid long lines and have the best experience .,1
we arrived at our designated time and waited in a short line to take the elevator to the 1st platform .,1
"as eiffel tower started to light up , one feels magic in the air ... transporting one to the land of awe and make believe .",1
"look out for the men selling little paris figures , roses and wrist bands these are pick pockets as we witness them being chased of by police ...",1
it is fun .,1
this is a must attraction if you visit paris .,1
it 's windy and cold on the top .,1
never thought i would be this impressed with a attraction .,1
"views from the top as expected , though it was very windy .",1
unbelievable experience to see it from close vicinity .,1
done at 10.30 pm we went straight in and straight up .,1
"this was one of the only places in paris for which we did not book a skip-the-line tour , and as a consequence it was also one of the only sites we did not end up visiting .",1
do n't be afraid of this .,1
purchasing elevator tickets online can be impossible because they are sold out for weeks in advance .,1
i popped out with a perfect view of the tower .,1
well worth the effort for amazing views over paris .,1
i wan na to go back but not during the winter 'cause it makes difficult to stay and enjoy outside .,1
i had no idea how busy this place would get in the middle of winter .,1
what other place to visit than eiffel tower .,1
-lrb- green flag entry -rrb- quickly went up the elevator and whipped past the huge lines .,1
i felt for the families with older people and young kids .,1
"while the structure is quite impressive , in my opinion , it is not worth going inside .",1
note .,1
"however , beware of the gypsies / pickpockets because they will approach you with a clipboard asking if you speak american or asking you to sign a petition .",1
staff was very attentive but not overbearing .,1
"my husband and i booked picnic lunch at the eiffel tower , i booked it online before out visit so we did n't have to queue up .",1
we got a bunch of tower key chains cheaply for people at home .,1
no shame .,1
very beautiful !,1
"worth getting to the top for the views , whether you brave the stairs or wait in line for the elevators .",1
this is an amazing structure .,1
it was worth the price of admission .,1
eiffel tower looks really beautiful at night .,1
the eiffel tower is somehow overrated .,1
looove it !!!,1
this is now the 3rd time i have gone up the eiffel and tower .,1
it was a bucket list activity for me to be able to go to the top of the tower but there was a strike so i was unable .,1
"day time and nights are completely different , experience both .",1
"we went about an hour before sunset , so we could enjoy the view in daylight , and stayed until after sunset to enjoy the lights of paris turning on .",1
way too crowded .,1
do see the light show - do get up close .,1
"we approached from the west , and were rewarded with brilliant views from across the river , against the trocadero .",1
the views are amazing and the atmosphere is superb .,1
"when you are standing infront of an iconic structure like eiffel tower , expectations can sometime be higher than usual ... and probably that 's why it was a disappointment to see eiffel the first time we laid eyes on it .",1
when in paris you have to visit this landmark its a must see .,1
great to finally go and see the famous landmark .,1
there are three observation platforms .,1
warning !,1
"great program for couples , friends and family .",1
"a must see throughout the day , specially on weekends for the night show and experience the city view from the lifts .",1
i have never been too fascinated by this monument but when i saw it on a cruise from the river siene at night - it looked stunning !,1
"the line to get into the tower is incredible , and not in a good way .",1
this is by far the best thing to do in paris .,1
"i knew it was big , but ... thing is massive .",1
"my husband and i have been twice now and going to the top of the tower is absolutely amazing , a truly unmissable experience .",1
"there 's so much to write about the eiffel tower , but i 'd suggest just go & experience it !",1
a not to be missed attraction that wil literally take your breath away .,1
"this is a must see if you go to paris , the views are amazing from the tower .",1
it 's a must see if your in paris .,1
we visited the tower back in 2010 but were put off going up it by the size of the queues to buy tickets .,1
it 's a beautiful tower with spectacular views .,1
"do yourself a favor , pay the extra for a window seat .",1
"a minus point that i must say about it was when a bunch of girls -lrb- eastern european - moldovan i guess -rrb- came to approach , ask to sign a paper then asking for money to donate -lrb- where the money will goes ? -rrb-",1
total queue time approximately 2.5 hours .,1
"before we came to paris , many people told us not to go , case it is not safe .",1
i never tire of seeing this beautiful site .,1
but the view at the top is worth all the trouble you go through to get there .,1
we went early and only waited 15 min in the security line .,1
we only visited the outside of the tower because the lines were just too long .,1
there was a quick bag check and despite being with a ` jump the q ' tour guide we waited over an hour to get the first lift to the second level .,1
if you are inside the tower it is amazing .,1
tip : go at night !,1
"yes , the que to enter are torturously long , yes there are annoying vendors who keep trying to peddle stuff to you while you wait to climb up but it is all worth it !",1
nevertheless we enjoyed walking around and taking pictures in this majestic site .,1
great view of the city !,1
"not to missed in paris , the beautiful eiffel tower .",1
"it 's still pricey , but bit as much as the eiffel tower .",1
"it has the best views of paris that you could possibly hope to see , and as someone who is deathly afraid of heights , it really was n't difficult to make it all the way to the top .",1
highly reccomed getting the fast passes : -rrb-,1
we booked a night time visit and was promptly allowed in after showing our tickets and going through security .,1
my review is to say do not miss the free video shown on the main level .,1
how bad can the eiffel tower be ?,1
if you want to eat at the restaurant on the second level consider making reservations a year in advance .,1
"some of the group went to level two , others to the top .",1
"first seeing the eiffel tower , was totally breath taking .",1
only went to second floor but the views were amazing .,1
of course it 's the place to be when you visit paris .,1
excellent views and lovely little boutiques and shops on both of the floors .,1
"when we were leaving , there were insistent young men trying to sell us tiny `` towers '' .",1
we enjoyed a glass of champagne at the top .,1
very cold in the third level .,1
-lrb- you do not need to buy the ticket from the bottom -rrb- .,1
"the glass floor is very scary at first , but you eventually get used to it .",1
"the food was scrumptious and the wine , excellent .",1
got the skip the line pass to go up to the top .,1
we passed by on one of the bateaux just as the clock hit ten in the evening to be treated to a spectacular light show .,1
be careful if you buy a ticket to the top as it was a 90 + minute wait but the ticket office on level 2 was closed so if you could not buy one there .,1
if you do n't you will wait hours in line to buy a ticket and for the elevators .,1
"many great and higher buildings around the world , but this is the mother building for all modern skyskraper construction .",1
it lasts for 5minutses and is on every hour after dark till about midnight i think .,1
we went at 4pm so that we can see the sunset and get pictures of day views and night views .,1
was very busy end of february and i can only imagine the zoo it will be in summer .,1
i went to eiffel tower two times in day time and during the night time .,1
second-there are a couple of security screening points .,1
but the bread & cheese take them to a whole new level .,1
"for those who have health issues , they r highly recommended to use they elevator .",1
we decided to go away this christmas and chose paris as a destination we both had longed to visit.we wanted to see the eiffel tower so we decided to take the metro over and were blown away by the experience.arriving with many many tourists on christmas day was truly magic.the views were stunning especially in the evening when the light began to come on all over the city and at 6pm the entire tower was illuminated with hundreds of twinkling lights.we had lunch on the second floor restaurant which was lovely.there was also a christmas market right beside the tower.only downside was the very long queue for the elevator to leave the tower as the stairways were closed off .,1
"the best view in paris , pre book your tickets to save time aim for the top level to get your coupe of champange and watch the lights of paris come alive",1
paris is such a lovely city .,1
it has been a wonderful exciting experience to be on top of eiffel tower .,1
use the entrance with a lift if you have children or problems walking up lots of stairs .,1
do n't get distracted by the commerce but enjoy the view .,1
we felt honoured to be able to stand up on the monument and look down on all the beautiful buildings and the river below .,1
maybe i am biased because i was purposed to in paris ... but anyways !,1
ca n't be beat !,1
my ticket was for the stairs however i thought it was for lift as the ticket said `` escalater '' which i assumed was elevator translation not stairs .,1
"though it is crowded below it , there are so many places in paris to get a good view .",1
we went all the way to the top and got amazing views !,1
advise to buy tickets ahead if you want to go all the way to the top .,1
you can get good views from other places in paris without the massive line .,1
"still , you have to see the eiffel tower if you visit paris .",1
"saw the fireworks on the eiffel tower on bastille day - wow , wow and did i say wow !",1
the view is remarkable .,1
a must go place !,1
you have to go to the eiffel tower while in paris .,1
"but it 's still something any visitor to paris should visit , even if you do n't go up the tower .",1
it will take you a while to queue in the line if you go in high season .,1
just back from effiel tower for which i visited two different days ... the toilets were absolutely disgusting .,1
"also , please inform your patrons in advance with signs that simple pocket knives are not permitted .",1
since this was a lil far from where we were staying this was the first thing we did .,1
this was my 2nd visit and i can never get enough of the iron lady .,1
shame the lift doest go straight to the top or its organised in a better way as you stand in several queues to get to the summit and then the same back .,1
we saw criminals trying to steal from people though .,1
i would advise yo take your passport/identity card to prove your age and get a cheaper ticket .,1
it is busy and it is high .,1
the eiffel tower is just one of those tourist attractions which you need to visit .,1
also beware of scam artists trying their luck with the `` 3 shells '' scam .,1
"the adjacent chap de mars park was a mess when we were there , with more beer bottle caps than grass .",1
otherwise walk the stairs .,1
make sure your pass includes travel to the 2nd level up top,1
"even though , it was beautiful to look out over the city .",1
you have to do it !,1
"unfortunately one of the cable cars was down while there , which made the wait times a little longer even with skip the queue passes .",1
nothing can compare to seeing this amazing piece of architecture in real life .,1
get there as early as you can !,1
it 's not worth going up on the eiffel tower .,1
"we went there around noon and we had to wait like 2.5 hours to pass security check no 1 , buy tickets , wait in line for the second security check just before the elevators .",1
you do have the option to walk up as well - which may have been quicker than waiting for the lift .,1
the evening really shows off the tower when it is lit up .,1
buy your tickets if you can in advance as there are queues if you do not .,1
"with the reserved time , the visit was a breeze !",1
"the view is spectacular , and to watch it light up at night is breathtaking .",1
oooyyy !,1
the security officers will throw them away at the gates .,1
"when i visited there were a number of women , in various stages of drunkenness who were drinking wine from glass bottles ... the top is open air and a drunk with a glass bottle is disconcerting .",1
pre purchase tickets is the way to go .,1
"after filling up , they ask you for cash as donation .",1
we did behind the scenes tour and it was well worth the extra money ... .,1
i chose the lift !,1
there were many pick-pocketers trying to snatch things from visitors in line .,1
"the top or summit has a champagne shop , a place to kiss and wax figure of gustav eiffel busy in discussion .",1
really something special to do wth the kids !,1
the tower opens at 9am .,1
it 's like your caught in a wind tunnel between the building and the outside and there is no true inside of the tour to go warm up since its wide open .,1
was my top priority to see and i 'm glad we got there .,1
first on everyones list when visiting paris and it does n't disappoint !,1
it 's always amazing just looking at it !,1
they are literally in your face as soon as you exit the turnstile .,1
"however , i was pleasantly surprised that the weather changes throughout the time of the visit and we were able to enjoy a less crowded day and captured beautiful photos of the tower and the views .",1
check first,1
we went to the tour eiffel around 5pm and was able to see it in the dawn and then at night with the lights on !,1
visited this stunning landmark on a special occasion when i saw this it makes me speechless how prominent it is that you will see every corner of the paris city .,1
the lights came on the tower as we came down .,1
no line what so ever .,1
the eiffel tower was even more impressive in real life than i thought it would be .,1
"we booked a skip the line tour with viator , so we were guided through the security lines and fast-tracked into the elevator .",1
the first floor has a glass floor .,1
however from the moment you step off the metro you are harassed by people selling tat and begging for money -lrb- this may well be a reflection of the current crisis in paris -rrb- .,1
"very nice views though so i would recommend because , come on , the reason a lot of people go to paris is because of this landmark .",1
avoid the river end entrance due to people harassing you at the turnstiles .,1
my fiancé and i made way to the eiffel tower for the second time .,1
you just need to plan ahead a little !,1
"surely one of europe 's most iconic structures , so beautiful and so fitting for a wonderful city like paris , you can literally spend hours sat on a bench just gazing at it in the sun , a must visit for anyone going to paris .",1
the only down side is there are a lot of people trying to sell you something so be careful of pick pockets .,1
i saw 4 soldiers in armed with automatic weapons and armored up marching in a square formation patrolling the area 5 meters apart .,1
go on live a little and enjoy being a tourist !,1
at least by purchasing tickets online we did n't have to wait in two lines .,1
the boutiques in the tower were great .,1
we booked the summit ticket in advance at 5pm .,1
the tower itself is as impressive as it looks in pictures .,1
spent a good couple of hours around this iconic structure on the hour it glitters and sparkles was very special eating drinking and enjoying being around this very famous building neither me nor my partner like hights so sadly we did n't go up it yet still enjoyed greatly,1
"it was amazing to see the inside of the pillars on the way up , and we were able to make our way all the way around the deck .",1
so ... may not be a 7 wonder of the world but pretty darn close .,1
powerful during the day and beautiful at night especially for 5 minutes every hour when the twinkling lights are lit .,1
"go not later than 22h30 , otherwise you are no longer allowed to enter the square beneath the tower and thus climb the tower .",1
when in paris you must see the eiffel tower !,1
if your fit can go up and enjoy the view .,1
visited the eiffel tower for the fourth time .,1
"i have not been in summer before , so i was surprised to see the grass in the park surrounding the tower so dry and brown .",1
it is a must do attraction of paris,1
i 've always wanted to go to the eiffel tower and i was lucky enough to go on my 5 year anniversary .,1
eiffel tower - one and only .,1
"the biggest challenge with the eiffel tower is making it up to the first level , as clearly once up the tower people spend differing amounts of time at each stage , this thins out the traffic and makes each quicker .",1
a few ppl waiting for elevetors .,1
i ' honestly would not have thought that i would pay to climb the tower .,1
"the security line was a bit long , but really probably only took 10-15 minutes .",1
why would you even come to paris without going to the eiffel tower ?,1
"we bought our tickets online , came with them and did n't wait at all in line !!!!",1
"you have to take a couple of lifts to get to the top , that said the service is quite efficient & reasonably fast .",1
specially at night the idiots hanging around trying to sell small eifeltowers etc are trouble .,1
went there on a friday evening in april with my family .,1
"of course , you have to come here !",1
"the very top is incredible , much like the observation decks of the empire state building in new york city .",1
"no big bags are allowed , everything you have is scanned , so there is no possibillity to get inside anything dangerous .",1
took some great pics .,1
i always wanted to ride up the the eiffel tower and had the opportunity last week .,1
"too bad the whole place so crowded , hard to move around and lots of time wasted in queues -lrb- security check , ticket line , line to upper level elevator , ladies toilet line ... -rrb- once been there , you can cross over this must-visit-place , and start focusing others ...",1
view from the top is breathtaking .,1
we had no problems .,1
"have to be impressed with this icon , but if your planning on going up , better plan in advance .",1
"if you are afraid of heights like me , beware !!",1
the volume of people was over whelming .,1
that 's amazing .,1
for all of you who are scared that they will be stuck waiting for your que for hours do n't be afraid : if you are there as we were : after 2 .,1
signage should also be clearer in ground floor to the different towers .,1
it can be seen best at the trocadero or from the garden on champ mars .,1
the first floor has plexiglass floors you can walk across and a cafe surrounded by astroturf and pop music .,1
it did n't seem packed with a bunch of tourist either .,1
and over the all it is really beautiful when you see it in night .,1
many people from all over the world to talk with as we went up and came down .,1
"if you are afraid of heights like myself put this onto your bucket list , , , yes i was scared legs shaking , , , but once the fright of level one in the lift i stayed in the lift and can proudly say i made it to the summit coming down was a lot easier , , , go for it ...",1
we took the tickets for the top though you can choose to go up only till the second floor .,1
lift to the second floor was ok then you have to get out to get a lift all the way to the top .,1
i think this is the most tourist attraction and when you plan to come here do n't forget to plan for queue and crowded .,1
the views you get from the top are simply stunning and you get to admire all the attractions paris has to offer from this podium .,1
we arrived around 8:50 am and were 2nd in line for the elevators to the top .,1
it 's the iconic structure in paris the symbol of paris and even france .,1
this is the only thing in paris that took my breath away - at the top of every hour at night the tower lights flash and it 's beautiful,1
the guide was exceptionally informative .,1
it is worth seeing during the day and night .,1
we were disappointed we could not see the top as it was overcrowded .,1
thank you expedia !!!,1
the tower is also beautiful to see lit up at night if you get the chance !,1
it is beautifully constructed and wonderful to see in real time .,1
"yes , there 's a queue : yes , there 's security : yes , there 's a price to pay , but this monument does not disappoint .",1
i was impressed by the structure of the tower .,1
the best place to have fun with friends .,1
"we only went to the second stage , but we will go back and go all the way up .",1
it a must when you visit paris .,1
paid $ 17 per head .,1
not sure i liked going up the tower !,1
"i was surprised as whilst there were a good few people at the top , it was not so crowded that you were uncomfortable .",1
your life is incomplete until you have stood below the eiffel tower .,1
we endured the two staged elevator journey from the base up to the tower -lrb- which felt like forever -rrb- and found ourselves speechless and gobsmacked at how amazing the views and whole experience was .,1
"the eiffel tower is amazing , but i found it more amazing from the ground .",1
nice view of the city !,1
much has been said about this landmark already .,1
amazing experience for the family and romantic as well with paris all around .,1
i guess if you 're a tourist in paris you have to go to the eiffel tower .,1
avoided the touts with mini towers and selfie sticks .,1
the tour was fine .,1
the eiffel tower is definitely the # 1 place to visit during ur stay in paris .,1
"as far as the architecture is concerned , `` magnificent '' .",1
"have a glass of wine , but i personally think having a picnic on the lawn out the front of the tower is a much better experience .",1
go in evening time so you will be able to capture sunset pictures !,1
we booked our tickets to the eiffel tower online via their website .,1
"the wind up there , esp in winter can be very very cold even at 0 degree or lower.gloves and warm cloths is a must .",1
i am terrified of heights but i love facing my fears .,1
its an amazing structure one must go and see the amazing steel structure and a prominent landmark .,1
its a must for any visit to paris !,1
the structure itself is amazing and worth the visit alone .,1
it only costs 11 euro to avoid the lines or taking the stairs .,1
try to visit early in the morning if you want to avoid the bus tours .,1
take a boat ride to see the best views along with the statue of liberty @ paris,1
this structure has a long history from the ww ii .,1
"having read the history of the eiffel tower , i really enjoyed visiting it again .",1
try to get here at night as well as the tower lit up is absolutely beautiful .,1
i purchased the lift tickets for going up to the summit online a month before our trip .,1
it was bigger and more awesome than i expected .,1
i suggest you walk down the steps to get view from all angles and heights .,1
"be sure to go up to the summit , even if your afraid of heights !",1
"yes , it 's fun to be spontaneous in paris , but this is an event to pre-plan .",1
at the ticket booth there was a small queue for the lift .,1
the views were spectacular from both levels .,1
this is by far the best thing to see in france if you go at night .,1
i booked our family of 5 tickets to level 2 using my phone and credit card .,1
"well , it 's pretty crowded , too .",1
"we highly recommend the skip the line tour , as you actually do skip a massive line -lrb- 1 to 2 hours waiting time -rrb- , and our tour guide had a great deal to offer concerning the history of the tower , and how it nearly did n't survive in its earlier days -lrb- what a loss this would have been to paris and all the world -rrb- !",1
paris authorities must stamp out these unpleasant and often confronting encounters for tourists .,1
that is amazing and worth waiting for at night .,1
we waited probably 30 minutes for the elevator to the 2nd floor .,1
"the best enjoyment of the eiffel tower is from a short distance , either by walking along the champs de mars or by viewing it from just across the river in the trocadero area .",1
"a solid steel marvel , the eiffel tower is really an iconic symbol of paris city .",1
"imo , the views from the second level are the best , but the top will take your breathe away .",1
"we went through trocadero , i think no words can describe the tower , the crowd , the queues -lrb- we did not queue though -rrb- ...",1
never again .,1
as others probably have commented it is a great experience with unparalleled views of the city .,1
the line for the elevator was really long .,1
"only thing we were disappointed with was the fountains below were not functioning due to maintenence , so will have to return one day .",1
i fantazied about visiting paris and it finally came true .,1
i came her many times and last time i visited in may 2015 .,1
we felt very safe up there .,1
honestly you 're better seeing it from a distance -lrb- and it makes more better photos -rrb- .,1
i know its a cliche to go up the eifell tower but you have to do it so worth going for the views one hour wait for the lift but wasnt too bad,1
"i personally didnt like paris but the eiffle tower is something else , its fantastic and worth visiting just for that",1
our tour guide explained the sites and then left us to tour the top level if we wanted to -lrb- included -rrb-,1
"it 's difficult to come to paris without photographing what was only meant as a temporary exhibit for the world 's fair in 1889 , but which now is one of the most recognisable structures in the world .",1
a million thanks to him and all his hard work .,1
not too bad given it was a weekend however the queue grew vastly in size by the time 9am came so get in early .,1
i think the best advice for you if you go to paris is buy all your tickets online ... you will be soooo proud of yourself when you see the lines to these attractions ... when your choosing the time of your visit it is best to go there before sunset ... then you have a chance to see the sunset and see the lovely city of paris before and after dark ... .,1
make sure you go early to avoid peak times as it gets crowded .,1
it was masked from our view as we walked and i 'd hoped my terrible sense of direction was not leading us in error .,1
i did n't care for it at all .,1
"it was great , highly recommended to skip the lines .",1
a must see on anyone 's bucket list !,1
just a landmark .,1
make sure you book online so that you can skip the lines .,1
you really have to see the eiffel tower twice - once during the day and once at night because at night the lights start flashing all over the place at regular intervals and it 's just fabulous .,1
i personally have visited only the first floor and it is more than enough .,1
"you can not help but be mesmerised by the glittering show , making the iconic landmark stand out even more remarkably in the parisian landscape .",1
our first visit to paris and found the eiffel tower to be everything we hoped for and more .,1
you can go upto the second level and on second level you can buy tickets for the top floor as well .,1
"take it down to the first level , then finish up by once again taking the stairs all the way down , you will not regret it , i promise you .",1
you have a great view of the tower from there and it 's ideal for taking photos with all the tower in the background .,1
`` you 're threatening me with a bad review ??,1
"i recommend to take the boat up the river approaching the eiffel tower from the water , beautiful scenery !",1
the eiffel tower definitely stands up for its reputation and glory and its imposing impressiveness is felt everywhere you go in paris .,1
were worth it to wait for the flickering lights at 22:00 that evening,1
"fantastic light show after dark , went on a river cruise the tower is spectacular from the river seine a must visit when in paris .",1
40 minutes in line on a thursday night to be packed into a lift with 20 other people pushed up against in a place where they warn about pickpockets constantly .,1
we did a guided tour which gave us a little more history about this iconic gem .,1
"this past july was our first time visiting paris , and the eiffel tower was a must on our list !",1
"if you are in paris for the first time , you must see this landmark .",1
the view of paris from the top is simply breathtaking .,1
the area around the tower is a bit tacky ... lots of touts pestering the tourists to buy trinkets or tricking them into buying wristbands .,1
we then decided to take the stairs .,1
viatour was the way to go !,1
"it can get very crowded at night with tourists , pokemon go players and you can even expect to see a proposal or two !",1
"it is best to get your tickets before you get there and get the more expensive ones my wife and i had dinner on the tower at night the view was great though the food was a bit alien to us but we had a good time.there is a second lift to go up to the this level.the day time visit is very crowded and as the security was tight , i would say a trip down the seine on a cruise boat was good",1
we waited anyway because of gun activity the day before security took entire am to decide if they 'd be open day i was going since closed day before .,1
"for some reason -lrb- probably to increase revenue -rrb- we could only buy a ticket to go to the first viewing level then had to purchase another ticket at that level to go up to the top , which we felt was a rip off .",1
it was well worth it !!,1
went to the second floor and the views as expected were amazing .,1
make sure you buy advanced tickets to avoid the lines .,1
really enjoyed doing the eiffel tower but only because we pre booked - an absolutely must - did it on a very hot day - probably a little more enjoyable on a slightly cooler day - well worth worth booking for the summit rather than just the 2ieme etage - champagne at the top lovely -lrb- if celebrating as we were -rrb- but at eur 14 for a tiny plastic glass - a little steep otherwise .,1
enjoyed a large beer and a couple of baguettes with meat and cheese enjoyed everything .,1
the whole trip was a dream come true .,1
just a metal structure representing nothing .,1
"seen it dozens of times , always amazes me .",1
"do buy the ticket to the top , although a few more euro , it 's worth every penny .",1
this has been a dream of mine since a kid .,1
as a must while you 're in paris this is a must .,1
with our printed receipt of a dinner reservation at le 58 tour eiffel we did not have to stand in line to buy a ticket and were able to enter through a separate entrance with virtually no wait .,1
get tickets in advance to avoid hours of waiting .,1
"even though i do n't do heights , it is a marvel of construction .",1
"unless it 's on your bucket list , you are n't missing ou on a great deal by going up it .",1
"the ride to the top was amazing , and the view is worth the money .",1
the best trip ever !!!,1
there is an entry fee and then there are long lines to go to the top,1
going to the top of the eiffel tower in our first full day in paris was great idea .,1
take a skip the line tour with a guide .,1
we arrived in paris for my wife 's birthday and this was to be our main visit .,1
"big tower sticking up out of paris , yes .",1
"yes , the lines can be crazy long , but you are in paris .",1
views near eiffel are amazing !,1
"no need to pre ok , only 7 euros to walk up to second floor , 5 for 12-24 year olds",1
i have seen this view from a bridge .,1
"we observed the torre eiffel in different angles and we tried to go up to the top of it , but was really crawded , too many people , so we decided just eat and enjoy the scenary there .",1
they do n't allow ant water bottles .,1
we went to the top of the eiffel tower and there was a lengthy queue .,1
the crowd management is good and smooth .,1
we paid to jump the queues and have a guide to show us around the tower .,1
we chose to go to the 3rd floor and had a very overpriced glass of champagne on the top .,1
view is unbeliveable .,1
and the shimmering eiffel tower every hour for 5 minutes is a treat to the eyes .,1
and it is special .,1
"just as beautiful and amazing as you would expect , even on a rainy day :-rrb- we only had 6 hours in paris and this was a much on our list !",1
our second time in paris and we finally got to go up the eiffel tower !,1
"if you want to visit the eiffel tower , the biggest tip is book .",1
such a beautiful place to visit .,1
i recommend you to go sacre coeur for better paris view and its free !,1
i have seen the eiffel etower several times and would advise a skip the lines ticket .,1
beautiful and majestic in its structure and also encompasses the beauty of the city in its own self .,1
take a picture with the tour eiffel in the background .,1
make sure to go to the top and enjoy paris you can see everything !,1
you can go on the staircase but i would suggest going on the elevator for grandparents/physically challenged people who have come to see this great tower .,1
my girlfriend and i greatly enjoyed our time at the eiffel tower .,1
"the eiffel tower never fails to make me marvel at its structure , its history and its modern beauty .",1
"the eiffel tower is a symbol of paris , so they say.i personally think , there are more beautiful things in paris to see , but this is unique exsperience.this is unique panorama across the city.for 5 minutes every hour this beautiful tour is illuminated wonderfully.around the tower there are always a lot of people , there are people who are selling souvenirs .",1
there is even a free museum on the eiffel tower with detailed explanation of its construction process .,1
today it is the landmark .,1
be advised that because this is a popular tourist attraction there are individuals there to target tourists .,1
paris ... as i had always imagined ... la ville lumière ... even though it was kind of snowing and cold ... the experience was real and raw .,1
i 'd recommend purchasing tickets online to avoid queueing during peak periods .,1
"however , we had to go down a level to get in line for tickets and then get in another line to get to the top .",1
the people around them are part of their crew .,1
amazing ... .,1
"it is a bit confusing finding your way to the elevator to the top , which we eventually did , only to realize the line was long .",1
it is lovely to see at night from the boat that cruises up and down the seine river .,1
they should have more historical info as part of the experience .,1
"located within two miles from our hotel , all we had to do is leave our hotel , look north at the intersection , and there it was .",1
this is a fantastic experience for love in the city of light !,1
"paris , i love it , i savour it , i enjoy it , speaking the language helps too , at any time as many times you are in paris you have to enjoy the splendid panoramic view of paris that the eiffel tower offers , depending on what time you visit the waiting time to get to the lift might varies , but beleive me it 's worth every minute of it , enjoy and have a camera ready , beautiful ...",1
"been here before , but now brought our son .",1
very unfortunate that such a high volume tourist attraction would be ill-equipped .,1
get a ticket and travel along the seine getting on and off as you please .,1
it is huge and awe inspiring .,1
!!!,1
ruining a great attraction .,1
we went on a saturday and it was really crowded so we had to wait in the line for about 90 mins .,1
"the only thing that was a shame was that the weather was a bit cloudy , therefor the view was not optimal",1
it was breathtaking going to the top in a transparent elevator .,1
"i suppose one must do this in france , particularly on a first visit .",1
the tower is beautiful at night .,1
"however , the best views are not from the tower itself because you do n't see the most iconic structure on the paris skyline -- the tower itself .",1
i visisted the tower after and enjoyed the city lights .,1
the worlds most famous tower !,1
we joined the queue and was at the top of the tower within 90 mins .,1
we had wonderful time visiting eiffel tower both night and day !,1
to really get a great view climb up the rc de triomphe .,1
i visited france this june .,1
get there early to avoid the queues !,1
i visited this beautiful tower in the day and night .,1
it was our first day in paris .,1
"remember to pay more and get direct access tickets as the other tickets sold online allow you to stand in a relatively shorter queue , which on the day we visited seemed to have hundreds of people ahead of us !",1
it was a cold day when we visited or we would have enjoyed the parks more .,1
"this way , you save the line-up .",1
views are like no other !,1
but well worth the view when i got up there .,1
i 'm terrified of heights and in fact cried all the way to the top !,1
took us about 5 minutes to get up to the 1st floor and and we did n't have to stop and catch our breathe .,1
we were fortunate to be able to purchase tickets online two months prior to our arrival .,1
and there will be so many people taking pictures and it will inevitably be crowded .,1
what else can be said except that now it lights up at night and is even more beautiful .,1
but it is worth it !,1
we went to second floor .,1
"whether lit up at night or straight up during the day , a marvelous experience .",1
the sheer size is incredible .,1
"well , my 4th time to go up & from 4 different visits .",1
you ca n't say that you have been to paris if you do n't visit the tower .,1
this is a must see if you are in paris .,1
went right to the top on the summit .,1
"then , we walked down to the 2nd floor -lrb- some kind of explore the eiffel towel -rrb- , and then took the elevator down from the 2nd floor .",1
i would personally request everyone who read this review to please be careful of pickpocketers below the eiffel tower .,1
"it was cloudy though so a lot of people were just taking the option of going to the first floor , we decided to go for the top anyway .",1
going up is an expensive option and can be a long wait .,1
in december we got our tickets for about 1.5 hours before sunset and made our way to the top floor at sunset .,1
i must say i fell in love with the tower and paris ... .,1
"you can purchase a pass to the top , or a pass to the second floor .",1
you have to go through security to enter the eiffel tower area and then again to use the restrooms .,1
what a view of the city !,1
it was cloudy and rainy but still a must see .,1
we also walked around the base of the tower by night and enjoyed the christmas market at its legs .,1
"visting paris , staying in a luxury hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary , my wife wanted to be at the summit on the day .",1
go ahead and go .,1
i eventually bought the ticket direct from the official website - the ticket allowed me to select a time i wanted to visit along with access to the summit and it was well worth it .,1
"so this is a perfect destination for early in the romig sunrise , no tourist , no noise ... or almost ... and you can contemplate the beautiful sunrise with a unique architecture piece",1
thanks to him we have the statue of liberty too .,1
that 's about it .,1
"but it 's still a special experience , climb the eiffel tower at a rainy day .",1
we decided to walk up to the second level of the eiffel tower .,1
its simply breathtaking .,1
the experience was fantastic and my wife and i waited in line to take the elevator to the very top .,1
we had the opportunity to do it early morning and it was a good choice !,1
definitely recommend pre booking tickets to go to the top .,1
"a fabulous experience but be prepared to queue for security check , queue for a ticket , queue for the elevator which drops you off at the second floor , queue for the elevator to the top , queue even longer for the elevator to bring you back to the second level , good fun walking the remainder of the way down to ground .",1
"it was an engineering marvel when it opened , and it is still marvelous .",1
it looks beautiful in the day and it looks beautiful in the night .,1
"in daylight even views from the 2nd floor -lrb- we took the stairs and was amazing -rrb- are incredible , sacre coeur off in the distance was beautiful .",1
"i was n't going to pay to go up , but was walking past on a day that was overcast and suddenly cleared up so there was no line .",1
we visited the eiffel tower by day on our last trip to paris .,1
we hired a guide which made the visit even more memorable .,1
be ready to wait for your turn !,1
"after reading a few sites on getting tickets , i found the cheapest ticket is booked directly through the eiffel website when you book your specific time .",1
sadly underneath the tower is very ugly these days with all the barriers etc. .,1
"amazing experience at the eiffel tower , we had bought tickets in advance so there was no queuing for us !",1
and you must go up in the evening .,1
the landmark was absolutely stunning .,1
"i 'd recommend going up inside the tower during the day for awesome views , but go back to the area at night for the light show !",1
what more can you say ?,1
i hope the french government is aware of this and changes it .,1
would highly recommend this tour .,1
the first thing she wanted to do was visit the eiffel tower .,1
"this was one of my bucket trips , i always wanted to do , i enjoyed it a lot , its best to visit during the week , early morning is good as the crowds are n't too bad , however be prepared to wait as even at these times , the queues ' can be quite long .",1
walking thru the stairs on the way back also gave a nice idea of the structural back-drop .,1
as a lot of sites in paris the eiffel tower is busy .,1
"this is a visit i can highly recommend to anyone , i would also recommend going at night when you can see the entire city with their lights on full display .",1
but it is nice to come up close and especially at night when the lights come on .,1
it was a lovely site .,1
"we also posted a review on viator 's website however , they did not bother to publish my review .",1
everything about it is beautiful and magical .,1
very nice at night,1
the pushing and shoving now to catch the second lift tto go to the top was incredulous .,1
the vendors were really cool to see at the bottom .,1
the views from the summit and the second floor are incredible .,1
go several times .,1
we then got on the river taxi from the for trip down the seine .,1
"flashing white lights on the hour and red , white , and blue lights for the 14 th of july and an illuminated soccer ball during the recent soccer games .",1
once on the second level the views were great and our tour guide gave us 15 minutes to go to the toilet and get food .,1
the eiffel tower is as awesome as you think it is .,1
from all over paris it looks fantastic .,1
there are always massive amounts of people who visit here .,1
got ta go .,1
"we eent up to the top , amazing views .",1
eiffel tower must be one of the best known landmark in the world .,1
"it was very tiring , scary , but so worth it , even if just for bragging rights .",1
we walked down but were glad of the lifts up .,1
we went to the second floor and to the summit which i highly recommend .,1
"the views were still breathtaking , even though it was a cloudy day .",1
it was an amazing view for the eyes .,1
and nothing can be more mesmerizing in this city !,1
nice to be able to say you 've walked up it !,1
this was probably the only area in paris that we did not feel completely safe .,1
you have to pay for elevators for second floor .,1
i had heard the prices were outrageous .,1
i proposed to my fiancé here .,1
"take the stairs up if you can , it is n't terribly hard and it is cheaper .",1
"we visited the 2nd floor , summit & then the 1st level in that order .",1
but you got ta see it !,1
we could either hang around with him to talk about the history of the many monuments in the city or make our way up to the third floor .,1
"the crowds are a bit much for me , but the view is spectacular .",1
there was no queue for the stairs so we thought that we should seize the opportunity - and we are so glad that we did .,1
it must be enjoyed in the daytime as well as at night when it sparkles with lights .,1
we went to the top and it was worth it and not scary .,1
"any later , there will be queues for the tickets and the lift , or walk .",1
the view from the top is stunning and definitely a must when you visit paris .,1
close to the metro and a brisk walk to many other famous parisian sites .,1
the park itself has trees which gives it dark moody vibe at night .,1
and the viewing platform was not that crowded .,1
walking up the stairs was hectic but it was a great exercise .,1
"yes , it is worth seeing .",1
eiffel tower is without doubt the most photographed landmark in france .,1
plenty of places to make pictures of yourself with it !,1
highly recommend that you book well in advance of when you want to go otherwise you could end up queueing for a very long time .,1
thoroughly enjoyed the experience - although it was blowing a gale on one side .,1
more or less summed up in the title of my review - we paid $ 17 which gave us access to the lift to take us up to the top .,1
highly recommend visiting this place,1
the icon of paris .,1
even witness a marriage proposal .,1
"mid week best time to see the eiffel and try early morning , before the bus loads of tourists arrive !",1
it was hard for us to justify an hour plus wait to say we went up versus actually using that time to explore this beautiful city .,1
i loved this experience .,1
we went and it was raining so we did n't have to que which was great.defiantly worth visiting the second floor also there is s little cafe to get warm and a little snack.also a little film room on how the tower was built .,1
"beware of people `` giving '' you things -lrb- roses , in my case -rrb- then expecting payment .",1
the lines got very long so make sure you get there early .,1
was quite disappointed,1
makes the magical paris come alive ... in you .,1
will definitely do this again .,1
paris city at night was completely amazing .,1
"i 'll just say that it 's all we hoped it would be ... huge , magical , an architectural marvel and particularly stunning at night .",1
people were literally waiting hours in the queue to try and get up the tower .,1
paris is huge and beautiful but very little trees .,1
it is lit with fantastic lights in the evening .,1
my teenage boys did not expect to be impressed and they thought it was great .,1
i was wondering why a lot of people want 's to go and visit the eiffel tower ?,1
it 's a non stop show,1
third trip to paris but this time i learned interesting facts by viewing from a step-on step-off bus .,1
wonderful experience despite the long queues and standing in the heat of summer .,1
tour guides buy them up then sell them online at four times the price .,1
wow,1
this is beautiful during the day as much as breath taking at night .,1
so instead we walked around and read up about the history and took in the enormity of the structure .,1
"ca n't miss this , buy your ticket ahead on line and you get to skip at least one line , the jules vern restaurant is great .",1
"it 's worth walking by on your walk along the seine river or a quick stop on one of those open tour buses , but not waiting in line to catch a ride on its elevator and in general the crowd and noise make it somewhat annoying not too mention swarms of petty thieves poker pickers",1
awesome view from 2nd level ...,1
it is beautiful at night all lit up with a sparkling light show for the first 5 minutes every hour after dark .,1
"this trip however , i wanted to feel paris at nighttime .",1
surrounding ?,1
awesome time was had by all and i will be back .,1
was nervous of going up as scared of heights but felt safe and the views were worth it .,1
"by the time we made our way back down , it was sunny and lines were crazy .",1
a great view is across the way at trocadero .,1
it costs much less and is a great way to enjoy the views as you climb the stairs .,1
we set the alarm for 2:30 am and by the time we got online the tickets were sold out .,1
you can not miss this attraction .,1
the pcv representative meets and greets everyone there and escorts us to one of the four entrances of the eiffel tower .,1
it is free to enjoy mingling and taking pics and very inexpensive to purchase a ticket to the top .,1
we visited her on the may holiday weekend and the process was well managed with minimal queuing and delay .,1
"it was far too cold , gusty winds , etc , and there is shelter in the tourist shops .",1
we sat down and picnic at the lawn beside the tower away from the queues .,1
it is a photographer 's delight from any distance and any angle !,1
i recommend both climbing all the way to the top and then hanging on the lawn in front at night when it lights up .,1
"also , tower was an amazing sight in the evening from the ground , and i 'm convinced that even if you do n't wait in line for hours to go up , seeing the tower up close at different vantage points at ground level is 75 % of the experience .",1
"best if you can prebook on the net , if you know when you 're going far enough in advance .",1
quietened down in the afternoon so maybe it 's the time to go then .,1
"hated it , plain and simple .",1
this means that the guide will walk you to the tower and give you a great history lesson about the tower and paris itself .,1
i had wanted to go up and see the views but i was n't going to waste 2 hours queuing as we had n't managed to pre book tickets .,1
"be sure to get to the top , it 's 15 euros but it takes long to get to the top .",1
but it 's the eiffel tour so just go !,1
actually my most romantic memories are of seeing the eiffel further away an in the night time .,1
the view is inspiring .,1
magical and unforgettable !,1
it goes without saying that u have to visit the eiffel tower if you 're in paris .,1
the twinkling lights are turned on for 5 minutes on the hour after dark .,1
the only way to go is to do the skip the line vip tour with viator .,1
the experience was amazing .,1
he was a fantastic parisian who was so passionate about his country it was great to see .,1
walk under the eiffel tower at nigh and see the lovely lights .,1
the organisation however of the queuing is extremely poor .,1
there are many cafe 's in the area as well as street vendors .,1
it is absolutely delicious with incredible views on the first floor whilst you dine .,1
a glass of champagne at the top is a must do -lrb- 13 or 17 euro 's -rrb- !,1
my recommendation would be to go at night .,1
the place is just so very beautiful .,1
a must see but better and quieter at night .,1
"if you have limited time in paris , i would not recommend going up the eiffel tower .",1
defiantly worth the money and heading all the way to the top .,1
wait is about 1.5 hours but well worth it .,1
no price is bigger for such a great experience.but is n't this the case 'cause you will be amazed to find out that it cost just 17 $ to get on top.it makes you feel like having paris on your feet !,1
"if you are thereon a busy day , just take some pictures .",1
"we stopped in the little coffee shop , but that was about all .",1
hoped that they would be understanding to my position and went when they first opened the next day in the hope that it would be quieter and might let me in .,1
then with the sun going down and the lights coming on paris looks its most romantic .,1
"it was created by gustave eiffel , born in 1832 and died in 1923 .",1
the dinner and view were great !,1
it is not an understatement in summer .,1
late afternoon sun casts a shadow of the tower over the city .,1
it 's a stunning architecture attraction and can only be fully appreciated when seen live .,1
think about the incredible feat of architecture to bend iron and erect this wrought lattice iron tower in the 19th century !,1
when we were there sliver clouds magnified the beauty of the tower .,1
try and go and see it in the daytime to have an idea what the structure looks like ... and then go at night to see it all lit up .,1
we paid the higher price to go all the way by lift - well worth it .,1
i was so excited and overwhelmed in a good way !,1
"we waited in the line to purchase our lift tickets , which was about 30-45 minutes , which many people kept telling us was not that bad .",1
we stayed until midnight to enjoy it !,1
very recomend at night two hour before closing becuse no line and not so many pepole up the viue is imaizing up in last flore you have coffie toilet and souvenir shop even telescope that you can look down .,1
the climb by stairs is more interesting .,1
"great view of paris , lots of history about the building , wonder and awe about its construction .",1
"on the top , the views are amazing and you can almost see all of paris !",1
if you 're not bothered about saying no to these people though it would be a nice thing to do .,1
"if you come during the evening and do n't want to pay to climb the tower , grab a drink , some snacks and a mat -lrb- the hotel towel will do -rrb- then just enjoy the view of the tower itself and the sparkling lights .",1
we chose to walk up as far as possible and are very glad to have done so .,1
be prepared for bag searches and security screening .,1
obviously one of the iconic tourist sites in the world .,1
lots of hustle and bustle .,1
"they have very tight security two check points , no toy weapons even .",1
more interesting things to see,1
the views were really good .,1
went for lunch on the eiffel tower as part of an organised tour .,1
iconic and masterful engineering marvel .,1
"my friend had never been before & as you can now buy skip the line tickets & there is a champagne bar on top , we decided to go .",1
only downside was the long queue to the the attractions popularity .,1
i was there with my mum this last 14 july and given her age i opted for renting an apartment two blocks away from eiffel tower .,1
views are excellent .,1
shining during day and sparkling during night this famous monument of france attracting millions of visitors every year is on champ de mars in paris .,1
it was fun doing this `` have to '' tourist attraction .,1
"i 've been to paris a few times , but only recently went up the eiffel tower .",1
they warn you about pick pockets while waiting in line too .,1
"this is a worldwide icon , so go !",1
amazing place to visit in paris .,1
"the queue is certainly shorter with the stairs , which are not quite difficult at all .",1
the views are second to none .,1
also seeing paris from that high up was beautiful .,1
was somehow crowded with football supporters .,1
views were wonderful even though we had some clouds & haze .,1
"on the tower climbed about 9 hours , see the view by day and waited for nightfall , something wonderful",1
"when you want to go there , its for whole mornig , before you pass through all the floors it can take up to three hours , but it was one of the best places , what i visited !",1
when in paris you must visit the eiffel tower .,1
and enjoy the 360 degres view of our city .,1
i highly recommend the trip .,1
"you 'll only need about 15 min to get in , in comparisson to ~ 2 hours lining to buy a ticket -lrb- trust me , i 've done the lining twice until i found the much more sane online booking ! -rrb-",1
all wait times were from 1 to 5 minutes for a friday visit .,1
i thought thad visiting eiffel tower will be dissapointing and did n't expected anything special .,1
is a scam and while you watch - or play - people behind you are taking things out of your pockets .,1
really surprised by the kindness and helpfulness of eiffel tower staff - giving us discount tickets and priority access - but i also found that this was the norm as we went about paris .,1
view magnificent !,1
great dinner at the eiffel tower - pre booked and prepaid .,1
we wee so fascinated by the monument that we went back almost every day in our 5 day visit .,1
one could not have expected to see something this extreme !,1
we bought a skip the line pass which was great as the line for regular tickets was very long .,1
the tower just has to be the most iconic constructio in the world .,1
me and my fiance visited the tower at night and it was beautiful .,1
il be honest in 25 years my husband and i have not prioritised paris for a visit but the eiffel tower was pretty wonderful and a real wow when it twinkled with pixie dust on the hour ... brought a big smile to my face .,1
really recommend this to anyone .,1
"this is a must visit , especially in the evening , we recommend something warm when you are on the top most floor , as the wind can be quite harsh .",1
a must see in the night - without which your visit to paris would not be complete .,1
we wound up deciding to use the stairs to climb up - you get get up to the second deck using the stairs .,1
a magnificent feat of engineering .,1
the cafe on the 2nd floor was delicious !,1
just book your ticket before you go or get it from the hotel,1
"yes , the queues are long , but you can book your tickets online to avoid them .",1
"definitely a must see but organise it in advance to save yourself time , even though it costs a bit more ,",1
"built to be temporary , but lucky for the world it became permanent .",1
an experience but could n't go to the top due ro the wind .,1
we visited the eiffel tower during a visit to paris for my birthday .,1
they run in crowd and surround from behind and front .,1
"unique experience , nothing to compare with .",1
"the eiffel tower made me fall in love with paris , it is the most beautiful landmark i have ever seen and would definitely recommend people going to see it .",1
the only thing that i can say about this amazing structure is that one needs to see it in person because movies or pictures do not make justice for it .,1
"u get food and different souvenir too , but they are comparatively costlier than what you get elsewhere .",1
spend it in paris on new years eve .,1
the eiffel tower is one thing in paris that stands out not only for its hight and the fact that it 's the eiffel tower but because of its complete indifference to the older style architecture of the city .,1
the 360 % view from the top of eiffel tower is wonderful and has 2 viewing levels up the tower .,1
on a tour so we did not have to wait to get in .,1
the view is picturesque and considerably a lot cheaper then what i thought it would be .,1
tour eiffel always beautiful both day and night time .,1
"we were there late , so top was closed and we had to take the elevator .",1
"if you have time visit the restaurant within the eiffel tower , its views are beautiful and the food is amazing !",1
"i was there in summer , there was a long line up and people waiting to get up to the tower .",1
one can buy on the spot tickets - but the lines can be long .,1
note that you should have a clear weather to see the city from the tower .,1
what an amazing experience to be at the top of the eiffel tower .,1
found this to be a huge disappointment .,1
"advance tickets can be purchased online , but the demand is so high , that as soon as a date opens on the calendar , tickets are snatched up ... and with 7 hours time difference between paris and mn , it is nearly impossible to purchase online tickets .",1
-lrb- some people have thrown them off - hence the ban -rrb- .,1
"and despite our many travels to paris , we always try to get a new pic taken here .",1
"it was a rather clear day , great views from the top , took our photos and admired the view .",1
"5th time in paris and despite visiting the eiffel tower on previous occasions , the furthest i got was the 2nd level due to volumes of visitors .",1
totally gorgeous .,1
it was a beautiful spring day and the weather was perfect for this .,1
what an awesome sight ... take the `` skip the line '' tour and you wo n't regret it !,1
everybody was having the time of their lives making a lot of pictures and having fun .,1
"we went up around 8pm , so we were down in time to see it light and the watched it sparkle at 10pm .",1
definitely walk back down its easy do n't queue for the lift .,1
i would recommend going up as the view is great .,1
every time i 'm in paris i take a walk in the area of eiffel tower .,1
me and my fiancé had visited in july '14 and thats the time i proposed her in the cold north winds shivering like how and that was a magical moment .,1
it 's worth going to the third level .,1
"we were in a hotel in bibliotheque fr mitterrand.we used to take rer c to tour eiffel or line 14 , got down at madeleine and took line 8 to ecole militaire",1
this made for a rather challenging experience .,1
we took the stairs -lrb- nearly killed me -rrb- but was well worth it !,1
such a beauty in person !!,1
if traveling solo ignore strangers who try to speak to you .,1
impressed by the unique and striking symbol of paris !,1
"the lines were baffling , and with so many panhandling gypsies and pirates we were glad to escape the crowds .",1
went up to the very top right away to make dinner reservations .,1
"it was quite a climb but more fun than the lift , we then queued for around 30 minutes to buy a summit lift ticket , so got to the top in around 90 minutes from leaving the base .",1
at 10pm there is special illumination which ch starts and last for 5 mins .,1
i 'd highly recommend it .,1
we were on our way to the hotel in taxi and there it was - standing tall in its full glory .,1
it 's a must see for paris because of how popular it is but i was n't extremely impressed .,1
we decided since in paris we should really be proper tourists and go up the eiffel tower .,1
no visit to paris would be complete without climbing onto this magnificent structure and drinking in the views of paris .,1
pre-book and pay for tickets on line as this saves a lot of time and then pay 6 extra euros to get to the top !,1
the iconic eiffel tower can best be views and pictured at night .,1
there is something that just draws me to this magnificent tower .,1
make sure to take lots of pictures .,1
"we had a clear day and spent easily an hour just watching the world go by , and of course taking copious amount of selfies .",1
walk was not strenuous at all .,1
fascinating structure .,1
and also you need to wait in queue in order to get the tickets and then to get to the top ...,1
whilst there is nothing to do on the ground floor the top floors are worth the wait .,1
"the elevator stops at all levels for visitors to get out and enjoy the views , gift shops etc. .",1
do n't stand in the long line !,1
no matter how long i stayed there i could not get over the enormity of the building !,1
full disclosure - we did not go up eiffel tower but just saw it from below .,1
had to do it once and i will say the view is great but ... it 's not easy climbing those stairs !,1
did n't go up due to high rush .,1
ohhh the looks we got !,1
really happy to see it,1
my favorite time involving the tower was sitting in champ de mars with the perfect view .,1
"went up it , which was cool , but we were way more impressed with the view of it from the ground at night and oh the twinkling lights were so stunning !",1
make sure to brave it to the top !,1
vive la france .,1
the scale of the eiffel tower is so grand that it 's just as breath taking every time you visit .,1
"we did n't pay to go up but did n't need to , plenty of photo opportunities on the ground and from the river .",1
"eiffel tower is not only the most popular tourist destination in paris , it 's the most popular destination in the world !",1
there are regular military patrols of no-nonsense soldiers as well as several individuals who were supposed to be plain-clothed but were n't very .,1
since we were both celebrating special anniversaries -lrb- 45th and 50th -rrb- we felt we deserved it !,1
went straight up to the top and the fog cleared whilst we were up there .,1
"now , you will still face the long , long line to get back down on the elevator , but you will save a ton of time when you get there .",1
"be sure to view the tower from several perspectives , it is beautiful from far away and very close views .",1
i would advise against buying tickets in advance as the eiffel tower operator does not allow you to change days .,1
security to enter the enclosure underneath the tower was thorough but not invasive and did not take long .,1
"when you think of paris , the first thing you think of is the eiffel tower .",1
visit each floor and try class floor at the 1st floor - i could n't step on that .,1
"we virtually skipped all lines to get in , so it was well worth it .",1
"also forked out for the fancy restaurant on the second level -lrb- booked 9 months in advance -rrb- you can climb , we opted to elevator .",1
it 's so large .,1
we took an embarrassing number of photos trying to get a respectable selfie and then moved on .,1
"if you dress like a tourist , they will try to prey on you .",1
i 'm not going to downplay the views of paris from the top of the tower .,1
i went up the eiffel tower on a foggy evening / night .,1
the view from the top of the tower was obscured by foggy weather conditions .,1
"given my fear of heights i decided to pass on the chance to go up the tower , however that did n't stop this being a worthwhile place to visit .",1
love the atmosphere on full moon night in july here .,1
"come prepared for the onslaught of africans trying to sell you trinkets every which way you look , but once you pass through security enjoy the tower itself .",1
beautiful to see by day or night .,1
not impressed at all .,1
"while i 've been here before , one can never tire of the eiffel tower .",1
you absolutely must order tickets online before you go .,1
20 years between visits and nothing much has changed .,1
highly recommend booking a reservation online prior to avoid long lines .,1
it looked high .,1
"do not miss , if that is even possible , as it can be seen from many places in paris .",1
when we get there it was a national day in paris and we do n't know about that and it was a surprise for us when watching a fire works in the sky .,1
ride the elevator to the second level and enjoy the views from every side .,1
this would have to be one of the best steel structures ever built .,1
this was my third visit to eiffel .,1
would definitely come back !,1
the views are magnificent and the souvenir shops fun to browse .,1
"also , up top you can get snacks and drinks , mind you ... quite expensive though -lrb- 13 euros for a small cup of champagne -rrb- .",1
be prepared for long lines .,1
you do n't have to go to the summit to get great views of paris .,1
"weather should be considered as fog , rain or wind will ruin your experience .",1
following the recent terrorist events security around this venue is strict and adds to the wait time just to get near to the actual tower itself .,1
it 's everything one might have imagined it to be and more .,1
we wandered around at lunch time on the 31st and made our way up the tower .,1
during the night its light up of different colors and look amazing .,1
so much better than i imagined .,1
it 's impossible to take the stairs all the way up for those who are climbing enthusiasts - they do n't allow that anymore .,1
too crowded during the day and much more crowded at night .,1
then we of course went to the top of the tower and spent time looking out at the city .,1
it is iconic .,1
i highly recommend going at night to see it lit up and it sparkles every hour which was nice .,1
a symbol of paris .,1
"for me , i prefer to enjoy the tower from trocadero since the situation under the tower was very crowded especially in the night .",1
go early to avoid long queue at the ticket window .,1
"it was wet and windy when we did it , which made it a bit hairy .",1
you do need advance reservations .,1
get some nice views from the champs de mars and the trocadero too if you have the time to walk around .,1
we took the time to have a coffee and some cakes and were surprised at the quality of the coffee and food .,1
"no wonder the eiffel tower is iconic , it looks amazing .",1
"the most iconic building , you can see this tower anywhere in paris as it is the highest building in this city .",1
"the views are all they say they are and you 're struck by how few tall buildings there are in paris , in contrast to london .",1
"an iconic structure , the sheer size of it the first time you get close will take your breath away .",1
"we booked using paris pass and unbeknownst to us , our letter of confirmation was not our ticket -lrb- even though at the ticket office it was explained to us it was ! -rrb-",1
could n't access the top floor due to poor weather generally a little disappointed ...,1
"came all the way to paris to go up the eiffel tower and met the rudest security guard 1300hrs south tower , very frustrated with my limited french .",1
the eiffel tower is definitely one of those do before you die things .,1
"they took pictures of everyone around me , never once ask to take my picture .",1
one must also go to the top of the eiffel tower by high speed lift .,1
it feels very safe surrounded by the guards .,1
so lucky to have travelled from the other part of the world to experience both day and night lights of paris .,1
if you come in winter time dress well and warm it 's freezing up there .,1
buy your tickets online at their official website and it is super easy .,1
"the queue was so long , we gave up .",1
stunning .,1
hard to get a taxi at night back to hotel though .,1
no place to buy food and the toilet ques where long .,1
"of course with the lighting , the eiffel tower is even more impressive at night .",1
"overall , it was a fun visit : -rrb-",1
wish we had bought tickets in advance .,1
"at he evening we had plan to visit the eiffel tower , there were a lot of people but from 4 corner we can climb it .",1
words can not describe it !,1
the arrangements are good .,1
the elevator does take you right to the top -lrb- if you wished -rrb- the views from the top are awesome you literally see for miles !,1
"by day , get to the top for the views , by night , the lights make it spectacle , especially with the five-minute light show .",1
ahhh paris .,1
did n't get in the lift till 7.30 pm so just made the sunset on level 2 .,1
while at the base of the tower be aware of pickpockets .,1
"this time we did not walk up the tower , but last time did .",1
watch out for pickpockets !,1
just be prepared to wait through lines but summit access procvides great view from the top .,1
thank goodness for elevators !!,1
overrated and huge lines to wait in .,1
make sure you reach the tower early in the morning .,1
the weather was stupendous .,1
it was about 5 or 6 with great light .,1
"there are two stopping points , each with a cafe and walk around area .",1
"it is their sad story , written to pull at the heart strings but while you are reading , others are picking your pocket .",1
at night the eiffel tower can be seen from some distance away with it being lighted .,1
the lines are almost cleared by that time .,1
it is worth the queue -lrb- marginally shorter in the morning around opening time -rrb- for the lift to the top .,1
"must visit and go up the tower , views are magnificent , plenty to do at stage one , great champagne bar .",1
definite tour time which allows you to plan your day better .,1
you get a small group tour and express to the first level .,1
"in fact , there was no availability for the entire month so it would seem advisable to search for tickets as soon as you know when you are going .",1
i love the architecture of the eiffel tower .,1
we came to the eiffel tower on a tour through fat tire tours .,1
it is good to reserve tickets on internet to avoid crowds .,1
great place and quite enjoyable .,1
"make shure , you wear warm clothing .",1
"we have n't been inside , there was a long line waiting for the security check , but we went up to the école militaire on the opposite side and had the most beautiful view on the eiffel tour .",1
we 've spend few hours on the second tier of the tower .,1
"we could not have guessed just how captivating the whole experience would be , it truly was one of the highlights of our visit to paris ; you really must visit the eiffel tower , we will be definitely be coming back !",1
paris it self is so beautiful and the view of paris from the top is awesome .,1
"some of the queue lines on the tower itself are narrow , and we saw a lot of people struggling with larger strollers that would n't fit - they actually had to carry them .",1
expect to take some time to go through security .,1
it 's a chunk of metal .,1
might help pass time as you shuffle in line for the elevators to the top .,1
interesting rides dec 2006 : paris sparkles at night .,1
if you can stand the queues -lrb- approx .,1
the simple grace and beauty of the design just boggles the mind when one remembers that it 's iron and meant to be a temporary structure .,1
"as i said , the eiffel tower is the most beautiful place to visit in paris , especially by night .",1
so beautiful and lovely .,1
"as suggested by friends , reached eiffel in the morning to find smaller queues for tickets to climb up the eiffel .",1
"it was 05:00 pm and we reached the top by 07:00 pm , it worth the wait .",1
it was gorgeous to see paris all lit up .,1
it ´ s trustable and works fine .,1
it was a constant push and shove of people throughout the whole experience .,1
we visited with our young son during the holiday markets and it was a dream come true .,1
"on the hour , the tower glistens with sparkly lights for a few minutes which is definitely worth seeing -lrb- from a distance ! -rrb-",1
we all strolled over past a line that was appx .,1
it was worth the wait -lrb- about 1h20 -rrb- - went there with a family - 2 adults and 2 children -lrb- 3 and 8 -rrb- .,1
he showed us where to stand on the elevators for the best views on the way up .,1
the previous time i visited i was waiting for two hours to go up the tower .,1
"the prices , as through the rest of paris , are insanely high .",1
"when we got here we were surprised by how little the crowd was , it was around 4pm on october 5th , and there was no line hardly .",1
the views of paris are magnificent .,1
"weather was good and we booked our tickets on line ahead of time , so lot a long line .",1
but better if you go all the way to the top !!,1
"the champagne bar up there was a bit disappointing , as i had imagined it to be a ` bar area ' to sit and enjoy a glass of champagne whilst taking in the views , but instead it was a hole in the wall where they hand you a plastic ` cone ' with champagne in to hold whilst standing / walking around .",1
so much to see as there are many landmarks to see .,1
the higher you go the more you pay .,1
"the eiffel tower is truly one of the most magnificent , identifiable , and signature landmarks in the world .",1
"take your time at the top , enjoying the views on each side .",1
"after being told by 2 different employees their customer service online would help , it was disappointing that they would not help , they were quite awful .",1
"every hour it comes alive , sparkling for 5 minutes !",1
it was even more amazing to see lit up at night .,1
went one evening and the line to walk the steps was non existent so we bought our tickets and went straight up .,1
we spent about 45 min on the tower in total .,1
i love it .,1
"we walked up the stairs to the first level , which still cost 6 euros but was worth the view .",1
so many people !,1
the eiffel tower will never go out of fashion !,1
"my daughter chased her again and she eventually threw the money she had taken and then disappeared down the metro , just be careful !!",1
"plenty of gendarmerie and soldiers in the area , but these ladies seemed to avoid their observation without any issue .",1
"get tickets to the summit , the view is really amaizing !!",1
fantastic views and great cafe for a well deserved drink .,1
have visited during day and at night .,1
dinner at cafe de l'homme terrace with amazing eiffel tower views .,1
"second , make sure you go all the way up to the top !",1
it was such a long queue and by the end of it we came out not sure if it was worth it .,1
i hate heights .,1
the eiffel tower being one of them .,1
a paris icon - do n't miss it !,1
"i 'm not convinced , though , that you actually have to go up in it .",1
"if you do find yourself stuck in the lines , however , at least they move quickly .",1
security is a bit to go thru but worth it all .,1
the view was perfect on a beautiful day .,1
there are very long lines just to enter the gardens area .,1
"at night though , it is really beautiful with all the lights , especially when they sparkle -lrb- at every hour for about 5 min . -rrb-",1
ooh la la !,1
you start across the river from the tower which offers wonderful views as well,1
well worth it when you see the big queues outside .,1
you could use the stairs for less .,1
"well worth the effort to walk up the 700 steps to the second story , great views from the platform .",1
we did this both day and night .,1
this is `` the '' place to visit if you are in paris .,1
do n't miss to come back at night 11 p.m -lrb- sunset is after 10.30 p.m. -rrb- sharp to watch a surprise light up till 11.05 p.m.,1
no photo can fulfill the first impression .,1
the overall time to get to the top is another 15 mins .,1
we decided to take the stairs as much cheaper -lrb- came to approx .,1
"my favourite part was once darkness had fallen , sitting back and watching it sparkle .",1
the effiel tower truly is a monumental symbol for the '' city of lights '' .,1
"of course the eiffel tower is on your list of must sees for paris , and rightfully so !",1
"thetower was closed , as it was during the weekend paris was in lockdown , but we were able to go anyway to see it .",1
lucky enoughn to be taken here by a lovely parisian who showed us the sights of paris .,1
i think eiffel tower does n't need my review.i just want to advise to buy ticket online a few monthes beforhand in order not to waste time in paris .,1
visited the eiffel tower last week .,1
"really beautiful experience , something you can do solo , friends and with family !",1
your best bet is to take the skip the line tour .,1
"visiting the eiffel tower at night is wonderful because you will be dazzled while you are up high , as well as on the ground .",1
we booked tickets online before we left -lrb- which i highly recommend ... we skipped the long ticket line and were able to walk straight the the line for the elevator -rrb- .,1
we went up on level 2 of the eiffel tower and it was good to pinpoint the landmarks of paris from top .,1
it is well worth the visit .,1
"reading about it , looking at pictures pales in comparison to actually visiting this significant landmark .",1
the view from level 1 is gorgeous and no need to purchase a ticket to level 2 .,1
"we went to paris for my wife 's birthday , and we started with champagne on the top of the eiffel tower .",1
the winds were pretty high but we did brave the outside deck !,1
its an awesome view from the top as you can see almost the full of paris .,1
i enjoyed a great dinner at the eiffel tower .,1
"we had not pre-booked however , the queue moved very quickly so we did n't have a long wait .",1
"it 's tremendous architecture , no wonder , it is one of the wonders of the world .",1
our pre-purchased tickets were awesome .,1
an iconic symbol from around the world .,1
you can stay at the top until midnight which is very special .,1
you are supposed to go directly to the second level -lrb- even though the elevator makes a stop at the first level -rrb- to catch the second elevator to the top .,1
lifts very large -lrb- 40 -rrb- pers ?,1
"i went here with my husband , and we really enjoyed it .",1
i managed to go with no queues which makes it a much more pleasant experience .,1
"it is a great experience , you 'll do it ones and that 's it .",1
very strict bag check before .,1
"we decided to look at the tower , take some photos , and leave without waiting an hour or more for an expensive ride up .",1
our second afternoon/evening of our first paris visit we toured the eiffel tower .,1
"the underground tour is interesting , but not for young children .",1
"there is an expensive restaurant on the first level , you need a reservation .",1
after reading information that tickets were sold out we were surprised to to be able to walk up to the line and be to the top of the eiffel tower within one hour .,1
and visit the tower everytime .,1
went to the top at dusk so seen the best of both sights .,1
amazing experience to view the tower from both on the ground and on the tower itself .,1
the tower looks slender and delicate from a distance but as you walk up to the base its size is overwhelming .,1
eiffel tower is a beautiful landmark in paris .,1
the area is a bit ` tacky ' but the experience was ok,1
it 's iconic and is spectacular on a sunny day and at night when it is all lit up .,1
"i wish there was more about why the tower was built and the history behind it , though .",1
"it 's an experience everyone should have as there are only a few spots to look over paris -lrb- sacre coeur , notre dame - the worst line , and montparnasse - no one knows they have a viewing deck ! -rrb-",1
want to go there again soon,1
"we thought maybe we had to turn in our printed tickets for regular ones , but in fact there was a line for people with internet * printed * tickets .",1
"we were there in june and although it is a world renowned spot , it was crowded and dirty ... hours wait to go up the top",1
could just keep staring all day long and spend a day in the lawns infront of the eiffel .,1
"in spite of endless raw of people , it was soooo fantastic",1
we got there before it opened and there was already a line to get in .,1
"one of the most exciting sightseeing in the world , it was my dream from about 25 years to visit paris and see eiffel tower , it is really amazing in real and very differnent than the photos .",1
and absolutely go and see it sparkling at night !,1
"over all its a sight to behold , night and day .",1
"the line for the stairs is much shorter , for obvious reasons .",1
the facilities on the first stage are much improved however .,1
the best time to go is about an hour before sunset .,1
my tween really enjoyed the tower .,1
"yes if you come to paris you must experience it , but once you 've done it once there 's no rush to go back .",1
it is on the must see list on the world - great place amazing view i do n't like high but the view its just breathtaking,1
"thus , we did not bother to go up and instead firmed up our decision to go up tour montparnasse in the evening to get a view of the landscape including eiffel tower at night .",1
please be sure to go on the very top of the tower .,1
you line up for lifts .,1
"for me personally , the best view is from the top of the arc de triumph at 10pm when the tower lights up ...",1
the tower being lit up was fun ... we had a great time .,1
"it was amazing , going very high , , watching paris from very high , .",1
we would recommend going up to the top floor if possible .,1
"10 mins climb to level 1 , 10 mins from there up to level 2 .",1
"in the morning , there is practically nobody there and experience the tower in solitude .",1
great people watching .,1
plan to spend several hours here .,1
we loved the eiffel tower tour .,1
"during the day it very very beautiful , impressive with thousands of tourists and couples waiting to reach the top or admire its beauty .",1
"we found it very enjoyable , informative , just the right length time and value for money .",1
walk around the corner and there the eiffel tower is !,1
it was included in the tour price as was the boat and louvre .,1
the area is well secured .,1
we did n't go up as we did n't have the time .,1
lots of history and information .,1
much as you would expect the tower really is stunning .,1
then on to the top .,1
thoroughly enjoyable,1
"the eiffel was one of my favourite tours , it was amazing to look at , if you do n't like heights this is a no no .",1
it was so amazing to be stood at the eiffel tower on my birthday !,1
"i imagine we 'll go up in it some other day ... but on this day , we were very happen to spend our limited time embracing the tower and park itself ... and not the inside of the stairwell .",1
"having done the tour , i was impressed with our guided his knowledge of the buildings an landmarks visible from atop the tower .",1
"i would advise you do call in on the first floor as it has more to it than the second such as the restaurant , and a small kiosk for soft drinks and beer .",1
"if you visit paris , the eiffel tower is a must !",1
preferably purchase tickets online !,1
fun possible fact : `` guy de maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower 's restaurant every day because it was the one place in paris where the tower was not visible . '',1
do not miss the night view of the tower when it has the lights of the color of the french flag .,1
you cant take your eyes off it !,1
an absolute must !,1
free to be under it and up close .,1
"even though i have been to the eiffel tower several times , i never get tired of seeing it and the views of paris from above .",1
"on our recent visit to paris , my husband and i and our friends decided to splurge with lunch at jules verne restaurant in the eiffel tower .",1
it is a must see and beautiful structure .,1
watch for pick pockets and the shady vendors in the area .,1
"illuminated , the tower gets mystical and the atmosphere gets magic .",1
should have purchased skip-the-line passes .,1
the view of paris at dusk is priceless .,1
"the line is very long , so get there early , deal with it , or pay extra .",1
walk along the seine at dusk and view the tower from the trocadero .,1
"what can you say about the eiffel tower , an amazing place .",1
"go all the way to the top , but views from level 2 are also impressive .",1
you will treasure it your whole life .,1
"however , on this visit we were in the first batch of climbers and by the time we go to the 1st level the gate was locked .",1
we visited all the floors and it was an unforgettable experience !!!,1
"simply a must do in paris , great views , iconic and fascinating , can be a long que on busy days , worth the effort",1
"we had heard all the horror stories ... lines , que 's ... do n't believe it !",1
"plus , if you hang around and grab a bite to eat , soon you 'll see it light up spectacularly for 5 minutes every hour , on the hour .",1
dream come though ...,1
my favorite landmark out of all those ive seen .,1
awesome sight !!,1
that was really amazing lighting view .,1
"the staff are friendly , especially if you make an effort to be friendly yourself .",1
taller than blackpool tower and in need of conquering .,1
it 's worth every penny !,1
"the tower is magnificent , you can watch it from all around nearby .",1
no need to go to the very top .,1
and risk being scammed or robbed in the process .,1
"you 've seen countless pictures , but there is something magical about le tour eiffel in person .",1
"we took photos at all the levels , and spent almost 1 1/2 hours seeing paris from a birds eye view .",1
the eiffel tower is what one thinks of if you mention paris so of course you need to go there.i would recommend buying your tickets online ahead of time -lrb- like we did -rrb- to avoid standing in long lines to buy the ticket .,1
"no need to go all the way to the top , but if you have time , why not ?",1
loved visiting again !,1
the first time we went during a busy afternoon .,1
however the drivers look intimidating and im sure quite a few people cough up .,1
"is important bring with you a jacket , because in the top it 's windy .",1
it 's amazin .,1
"it 's defiantly a must do when in paris , would n't recommend doing it in bad weather as you ca n't see a lot .",1
we did not book tickets ahead of time and thought we would just walk around the base .,1
foi algo que nunca esqueceremos !,1
wonderful time in paris ... i did everything i wanted to do .,1
"or , save time a take the stairs .",1
"going to the 2nd or 3rd floors offers an amazing view on paris ' geography , the sense of perspective that was displayed by the architects over centuries and , altogether , the spectacular beauty of the city .",1
"fascinating , scintillating , romantic , fun ... well you get my drift .",1
the queue is crazy .,1
"went to the top of the eiffel tower on thursday , 19 may 2016 .",1
"apparently , it is the most visited tourist attraction in the world , or so they say .",1
too expensive and crowded .,1
a short walk from the trocadéro métro station leads you to a viewing platform that affords an uninterrupted view of the eiffel tower over the seine .,1
eiffel stands alone in magnificence .,1
"our party of nine included folk from england , australia and the usa .",1
the queues can be long but it is worth the wait .,1
and maybe taking the time to go up to one of the viewing platforms .,1
wow is what comes to mind when walking up to the tower .,1
"every time we go to paris , we make it a point to stop by there .",1
no need to go to the top .,1
the eiffel tower is located in a huge park .,1
"must-see in paris , unforgettable experience !",1
there were many tourists and they made long line to go up the tower .,1
i enjoy sitting in the park at the base of the tower .,1
do not miss this !!!,1
this was my 3rd visit to the eiffel tower and my daughter 's first .,1
"ok , premier tourist attraction of france , if not the world .",1
"everyone does , hence the queues .",1
it really is everything you want it to be .,1
you have to book a table in the restaurant .,1
i 'd definitely recommend pre-booking tickets as queues could take up over an hour !,1
tower glitters every ten mins .,1
definitely a must-do if in paris .,1
well we stepped off the lift and were met by some fantastic views !,1
queues were long to go through security .,1
as many times as i go to paris i have to go and take another self tour or sit below and watch the people go by .,1
who goes to paris and not want to see the eiffel tower - it is beautiful and can be seen in most corners of the city .,1
"was like a dream be there , see the tower .",1
i 'm not sure when they do it but i was there at 7pm .,1
especially when they light it up .,1
it is a good place for picture taking .,1
try to be there as the lights are due to be turned on .,1
arrived around 11:30 am and had a 5 minute wait to go up .,1
this was an overwhelming moment .,1
its so big ... its so beautiful ... it takes the breath out of you when you are standing in front of it !,1
"simply because its marvellous , beautifully designed and well maintained .",1
the whole neighborhood feels some thing else .,1
"if you must do the eiffel tower , take my advice and do n't do it just for the tower but use it a part of the paris experience .",1
never fail to impress me .,1
went to the 2nd level right on sunset was amazing .,1
going for the top is bit challenging as you will have to wait in long queues first to buy the ticket and second to wait for the lift .,1
it is interesting staying on the glass floor 50 meters up .,1
we went at 10pm at night and not many police around .,1
"the tower is central to many great paris walks , where one sees iconic vista after iconic vista , known through postcards , movies , books and television .",1
more than $ 435 us for two of us for just our meals and one drink a piece .,1
wow !!,1
"this clearly remains a a very popular attraction but it has sadly attracted many undesirable street sellers , beware .",1
"the view from the 2nd floor is gorgeous of course , but it was also wonderful to walk down the steps all the way to the street .",1
"if you go at evening , you can even see the reflection of the eiffel in a glass faced building which is a nice experience .",1
no words needed .,1
kids loved standing beneath and looking up .,1
$ 17 euros for the lift all the way to the top .,1
"after finally getting to the summit , the game starts all over again when you wait in line to take the elevator down to the 1st platform and then wait again for the elevator to the bottom .",1
it was way more crowded than i thought .,1
the lights are worth watching .,1
amazing view of paris at the top !,1
"plus on the hour , the tower lights flash on and off for about 5 minutes .",1
we paid and took the lift all the way up !,1
the tour began in an underground bunker not to far from the tower .,1
take a jacket with you as it 's windy up there .,1
great view from whatever ankle you are .,1
if you walk up you can take the lift down !,1
"the surrounding area is packed with sellers trying to get you to buy models of the tower , selfie sticks , wrist bands made out of thread or to sign petitions .",1
watch out for queue jumpers as you get to the metal barriers for the final queue to pay .,1
easy to get to by public transport .,1
"please if you go , make it to the top !!!",1
"it is a iconic tower for paris , but not much to see , especially after lighting but if you are paris you should go tehre and take a picture : -rrb-",1
eiffel tower is just lovely most especially at night time .,1
we enjoyed the view of paris from the top of the tower .,1
we visited all three levels and liked the middle platform best .,1
"the view from the summit is amazing , and worth the time .",1
"it 's everything that you expect , maybe more .",1
we walked up the stairs to the second stage and really enjoyed the trip .,1
sadly the park grounds are closed right now and security is extreme .,1
"the river is close by , to pick up a cruise afterwards .",1
just amazingly beautiful to see this structure at night .,1
from the ground floor to the top it is pure emotion .,1
"all along the stairs a lot of useful information about the architecture , family details , where else the technology was used etc. .",1
i would love to hear from tripadvisor people what their feeling were seeing these places 60 years ago until now ... paris has to be the most beautiful city in the world !,1
we had n't bought tickets in advance but the queue was n't too bad .,1
did n't go right up to it as could see it best from the palais de chaillot and did n't want to go up it as terrified of heights .,1
shame on your staff member though .,1
weather in january can be unpredictable .,1
fyi : if you pre-purchase your tickets you enter on the opposite side of trocadero -lrb- or river side -rrb- .,1
"i would highly recommend buying tickets online , from the official website , prior to arrival .",1
it is both more convenient and cheaper to book online than to stand in the queues .,1
the views from the top are unbeatable both during day and night .,1
best to come september onwards .,1
"there were no lines to buy tickets and go up the tower , either .",1
but the walk was n't too bad and of course worth it for the view .,1
we could n't find the bar supposedly it 's at the very top .,1
"with the added security it slower but makes you safe , so embrace it .",1
make sure you stay for the on the hour sparkle light show !,1
"however , i would say the view from afar looks much nicer than when you 're right underneath it .",1
i also recommend that you purchase your tickets online and have them in hand when you arrive .,1
paris is probably the most beautiful city in the world and the eiffel tower is the visible trademark of that claim .,1
there was a lot of work going on around it which spoilt its look a bit .,1
you can purchase tickets on the day you visit but you may not get the time you want .,1
we had timed tickets for 12:30 on a tuesday in late august and also used a disabled card to go to the head of the security line .,1
we eyed up the correct entrance and went to join ...,1
the eiffel tower is beautiful and i have always admired it .,1
best view in paris .,1
my only addition is that please ensure that you book ahead and plan to spend some quality time and not do a quick tour .,1
"if do n't care about seeing the paris view from that height skip going in ... we went through 3 security ck points just to get to 1st viewing level , -lrb- could have been because of activity from day before though -rrb-",1
"as many metro stop operation after 11pm , need to plan accordingly to avoid taxi fare .",1
"wow , absolutely amazing , we took the tour which was great and i would recommend , we saw the bunker where all the food is prepared then shipped up the tower .",1
"also , the security checkpoint lines do get long fairly quickly , so plan to be there early .",1
"on the first level you can find food , drinks , and gift shops .",1
-lrb- 13 $ / small glass -rrb- .,1
this was my first trip to paris .,1
we took a tour to the submit and the view is breath taking .,1
just so cool .,1
police are very visible but not so sure if they will be helpful to you in case you become a victim of pickpocket .,1
after going through security -lrb- which we found very reassuring -rrb- we got in line to buy tickets on the first trip up of the day .,1
to get inside you need to pass several security rings .,1
i visited with two children and decided to walk up the tower .,1
"pre-purchased skip the line tickets ; which means you are in a shorter line to get in , line to get to level one , and line to get to level two .",1
amazing views but can be crowded .,1
i first saw the eiffel tower when i was bumming around europe in the summer of 1969 .,1
going up in the evening when the tower was lit really enhanced the experience .,1
we opted to go down and look at the tower instead !,1
very near our hotel and just lovely to see .,1
and really cost effective .,1
beautiful icon to see close up and far away .,1
a definite must if you are planning a trip to paris .,1
"the evening champagne cruise -lrb- approximately 1-hour -rrb- takes you up and down the seine around the ile de la cite , and the eiffel tower at night is phenomenal .",1
beautiful and majestic .,1
"otherwise , that room gets a little `` busy '' .",1
need we say anything else ?,1
i love this tower : -rrb-,1
lots of people but not overwhelming !,1
at least once in your life you must visit the eiffel tower .,1
yes it costs more but worth the extra .,1
its fun to spot the prominent landmarks of paris .,1
it 's such a cool feeling to see the eiffel tour and know you are in paris .,1
"also , do n't miss the night view of the tower 's lights .",1
brilliant views over the city and you did n't feel rushed .,1
"you have to get there at night , it cost 17 euros to go all the way to the top level and it 's worth it .",1
"beautiful place , but really crowded .",1
you can also purchase lift tickets .,1
"do n't miss that , it 's truly magic , and it lasts 5 minutes each time .",1
make sure you leave plenty of time to get back down as queues are quite long .,1
great for kids .,1
so that you stay in another queue at the second floor to buy a ticket for the top instead of enjoying yourself at the second floor .,1
from we joined the queue to pay until we reached the top and back down again took only one hour .,1
i had no idea that is tower was/is used for so many science experiments !,1
"as in case of louvre , there is not much that could be said about the eiffel tower .",1
it 's interesting when you walk around and you hear all types of languages .,1
"the view from the top was n't as bad as we thought it would be , given the weather .",1
generally i did have a really good time at the eiffel tower though the weather is not sunny or nice at all .,1
the guide was well-informed and full of enthusiasm .,1
"we 'd been to here 3 years ago in day time , walked up from ground to 2nd platform , took the elevator to the top and had a glass of champagne , it was a special experience .",1
"again , not to be missed .",1
"keep in mind that even if you get a paid ticket in advance for the summit , there is still a long line to wait to get up there .",1
"if you have n't already , go see it !",1
anyone would love it .,1
it takes around 2 - 3 hours to go to top and come back .,1
more impressive than i had imagined !,1
i found it beautiful at certain distances but somewhat over industrial in comparison to its surrounds .,1
"as expected there was quite a sizeable crowd queueing for the climb or just generally hovering around , with the customary number of touts catering to the demand .",1
awesome experience .,1
wine at restaurants is very expensive in paris but not at the grocery stores .,1
i took my fiancee -lrb- then girlfriend -rrb- to paris for her 21st birthday in june 2014 -lrb- late review was n't a member then -rrb- .,1
"walk around , going up , down .",1
"this was our first visit , and it was pretty awesome .",1
"the evening tour times were all taken so if that is your objective , book way early depending on the month you want to visit .",1
"you can take a chance , show up at the tower ticket window , wait a minimum of one hour on line to obtain a limited number of tickets available per day .",1
"therefore , it is n't as crowded .",1
when we had seen all sides we left .,1
to think it was built in the 1880 's with no computers .,1
the eiffel tower is one of the main attractions in paris .,1
travel july 2014 .,1
many people would agree that visiting eiffel tower is a must when visiting paris .,1
stank of urine when door opened floor full of urine and toilet roll ... a person even wrote on the mirror please clean this disgusting place !!!!,1
the eiffel tower can be seen from all over paris .,1
when we visited the french open was being played on a giant screen with lots of people watching it .,1
it is worth visiting in the evening to see the `` light up '' .,1
it was quiet and no lines to go up .,1
"i have been to paris many times , but the trip is never complete until i see the eiffel tower !",1
"as always the place to visit , an amazing structure .",1
go early if you want to go straight to the top .,1
just like all of the other reviews thus was quite spectacular but be warned you will be shoulder to shoulder with people .,1
watch out for them !,1
go all the way to the top ... repeat go to the top ... pay attention to signs - some are confusing as to where to line up .,1
this time it was a last minute trip so tickets were all sold out online .,1
going to the eiffel tower means waiting .,1
great view of paris from last floor of tower .,1
"do n't worry about buying skip the line tickets in advance , the queue appears long to buy tickets , but it moves very quickly .",1
and the bathroom line is long .,1
the 1st 2 years we gave up when we saw the size of the queues .,1
but it was a must do for paris .,1
i was n't going to go to the top with our family of five because of all the confusing ticket scenarios .,1
had lunch here and did n't expect it to be so fancy and relaxing .,1
the view from the restaurant levels were awesome .,1
we loved visiting the eiffel tower .,1
but once there it was a pleasant experience .,1
do n't forget the tissues .,1
"otherwise , long queue is guaranteed .",1
we visited the eiffel tower and had lunch there .,1
lunch was really tasty .,1
the eiffel tower itself is absolutely iconic .,1
dress up appropriately as it 's windy up the tower .,1
"you can pre-purchase your tickets to the observation deck however , we booked lunch at ' 58 ' -lrb- the restaurant on the first level of the eiffel tower -rrb- and it included the entrance into the eiffel tower and the ticket on the elevator up .",1
we were not disappointed !,1
another draw back is that there are way too many souvenir hawkers than one would ever need .,1
but long lines .,1
you walk out of the metro station and just a few meters around the corner onto the plaza and the most magnificent spectacle is there to surprise you .,1
is it a must visit ?,1
unforgettable night out .,1
the view from the top floor is beautiful so it is best if you go up on a nice clear day .,1
"our tour got us there in time , despite paris traffic .",1
"by fortunate or unfortunate i have wait for 8 hrs at paris airport , so i have decide to go out and see eiffel tower .",1
i think they know it and charge what they want .,1
long queues to the summit -lrb- although you have bought the tickets in advance -rrb- .,1
i really liked how friendly and informative our guide was,1
price at the eiffel tower was only $ 17 euros - went on a weekday evening and there was no line .,1
wonderful place to visit .,1
eiffel,1
everything we expected and more !,1
"for people that do n't like heights , do n't go the highest level .",1
"that 's my recommendation , having done it both ways !",1
tick off the bucket list .,1
tallest iron tower .,1
best place in paris .,1
... but unfortunately must see ...,1
and queuing again to just go down .,1
"admittedly , i got goose bumps in the same way i do when seeing the statue of liberty .",1
you can see very well from the first deck .,1
"the queue to the top part was long , we thought we have time so queued , over an hour later we got in the lift , on leaving the lift the queue to go back down was massive and we thought we had better spend too much time up here .",1
"being in paris i simply had to visit the eiffel tower , having seen it in pictures and on tv before i did n't think it would be as breath taking !",1
it met the huge expectations it raises .,1
luckily the tour was skip the line all the way to the top and that save a lot of times .,1
how can you not visit it if you 're in paris ?,1
"my son , 14 , could not be convinced to go to the very top , which , if you afraid of heights is natural .",1
we got one of those `` beat the line '' tickets -lrb- online -rrb- which came with a short guided tour .,1
bring your lunch and water with you and have lunch while you wait in line for 2 hours .,1
we are over 65 years old and it took us 12 minutes to get to the second floor .,1
queue looked as though it was going to take hours but we were pleasantly surprised and although it is busy with the usual rude tourists that do n't seem to understand how to queue we had a great day .,1
the tower it 's self is amazing .,1
i do n't think a detailed review is required here .,1
you can take the stairs down from the second level to the first level - recommended .,1
it is hard to see it lite up because in the summer it gets dark late .,1
"there was a queue for security which took about 10 mins , but we walked straight up to ticket office and got straight up to the top in no time .",1
"timed , advanced purchased tickets are essential .",1
of course once can not leave paris without visiting eiffel tower .,1
"we bought skip the line tour tickets via viator , but with the wheelchair it was probably unnecessary .",1
the last time i went it was extremely windy but still amazed me .,1
one does have to consider if it 's worthwhile dealing with rude security staff on site .,1
this was a fantastic time to go as there were no crowds at all !,1
"come down to 1st floor , lie on the glass floor and take pics , enjoy coffee , chocolate and more in the the restaurants , sit there for at least an hour and simply enjoy .",1
although the guide told us we could listen to her talk and still have time to go to the top she was wrong .,1
be prepared to stand in line for the lift even if you get your tickets in advance .,1
"of course you are going to go , but just know the lines are long and even if you buy your tickets in advance .",1
i loved everything about it !,1
we queued for an hour .,1
it is definitely worth it .,1
"the theme was a picnic so i did n't have have high hopes for the menu , it was however very good , not hot dogs and hamburgers .",1
a must see attraction in france .,1
"even if you 're relaxing on the grassy area behind the tower , they 'll come over to you and offer beer/wine for a few euros and you 'll hear that pitch at least a dozen times .",1
this lift goes a lot faster .,1
go to the restaurant in the first floor and enjoy a wonderful meal .,1
but we were lucky enough to find an suv taxi that could return the six of us back to the marais .,1
gifts are usually twice as expensive than in the other official outlets in paris .,1
if you want to see paris at night be aware that the restaurant closes early even on weekends so you will only have an hour or two and below to see the city lit up as france does n't have a sundown until 10 o'clock at night,1
the site is fantastic and the views of the tower are amazing .,1
a great site to see but the people trying to sell you things was very annoying .,1
"you ca n't come to paris and not visit the eiffel tower , the queues are huge but we purchased a `` skip the queue '' ticket before we left the uk which was great value for money .",1
"great views , i 'm sure even better in nice weather .",1
"but for this first viewing , it was the pinnacle of my paris tour .",1
check on the timings we nearly missed it .,1
beware that main lift only seems to stop at level 1 on the way down .,1
not to difficult .,1
night is especially captivating with the light show on the tour every hour after it gets dark .,1
but other than that its a just brown metal stacked on top of each other .,1
"touristy , but worth the crowd .",1
and the view is actually the best from that level .,1
the top floors were closed due to wind .,1
"bigger than we expected , had to queue for security and tickets , to be expected , great views , you can spend as long as you want up in the tower when we were there it was very windy !",1
3rd trip to eiffel tower but first with children .,1
especially the view from the top is amazing .,1
it 's totally fun to walk down the stairs from the second floor !,1
$ 25 for both of us to the top .,1
you do not stand in line for a ticket .,1
"although unable to go up to the very top due to renovations , the rest of the experience is fabulous .",1
"after climbing up from the ground to the 2nd platform , we found that the elevator to the top was off for maintenance for 2 weeks !",1
going to the first stop in the tower is free if you take the stairs but i recommend paying the elevator throughout the entire tower for both levels since the lines are smaller and the difference in cash is not huge .,1
its definitely worth it !,1
"we visited the louvre on wednesday and although crowded , the size of the louvre soon disperses any crowd to manageable sizes , even to view such items as the mona lisa .",1
it is one of the seven wonders of the modern world .,1
"there are two levels you can go on but if you want to go to the top you have to pay more , on the lower level there are souvenir shops and a little counter to buy food , however everything was over priced .",1
evening photography is beautiful .,1
you ca n't go to paris without two visits to the eiffel tower .,1
was a brilliant and memorable experience .,1
i did n't go up the tower as i personally thought it was expensive but i was also on a very tight budget .,1
my favorite aspect of la tour eiffel - the lights and its sparkle on the the hour .,1
"when in the lifts , look up and take a photo shot of the steel structure - it 's an amazing structure .",1
"there are a lot of police nearby to discourage pickpockets and unauthorized vendors , but still be aware of your surroundings , so that you will be able to have a wonderful experience here .",1
good value for wheelchair user and companion and helpful staff great views glass floor on level 1 and cafe.level 2 not accessible for wheelchair users,1
"i can understand going to paris and not actually visiting the et , because just to see it from afar is a lucky and romantic treat , but now that i 've done it -- i ca n't believe that i 've never done it before .",1
the queues were very very long and you are pestered by hawkers .,1
there 's nowhere close by where you can go for cover either so come prepared with an umbrella or poncho .,1
we had reserved tickets for the top level that worked out to be just before sunset .,1
we arrived for out time booked and were at the top within 10 minutes .,1
the view from the second level is amazing - a definite must do in paris .,1
"i was there in march , and many dates and times were sold out a month ahead .",1
the lines are very long but goes quite quickly .,1
some spectacular views and stunning picture opportunities .,1
it was everything around it and getting to it .,1
"such a beautiful place be aware of pocket pickers , buy advance ticket and take food with you if you want live with in budget",1
"every bit of amazing from afar as it is up close , a wonderful iconic tower overlooking all that the wonderful parisians can offer ... usual pick pocket gangs etc so be careful",1
reasonably priced tickets - coffee was a total rip off -lrb- as to be expected -rrb- .,1
so better go to the montparnasse tower - for amazing view with eiffel tower :-rrb- and no entry queue as enjoyable bonus .,1
the crowds of tourists make the surroundings sweltering in the summer heat and not a place to spend much time most people do not actually go to the top of the eiffel tower as the wait on line is lengthy .,1
there were signs by each leg to say if they were lift or stairs but these were n't readily apparent with so many people around so better information on site would n't go amiss .,1
"try to avoid the gypsies because they have mastered the area and i have seen children used to steal purses , cameras , etc and disappear through the crowd with help of their group .",1
"very crowded as you would expect but go late at night you see at its best and its less busy , go with a friend the many vendors with their flashing eiffel towers may be intimidating on your own",1
we did a guided tour which included a lunch and stop at the tower - this is the best way to see it and you avoid all the long queues -lrb- you kind of get used to them in paris -rrb- .,1
that is so beautiful !,1
"museums , monumentums , plazas , palaces , cathedrals and the respect for its founder fathers talk about that , however , the eiffel tower allows to all visitors to see every corner of this beautifull city from a pure touristic perspective .",1
worth the lines .,1
well worth every penny !!,1
"anyone who shows up to the eiffel tower expecting it to be uncrowded , not touristy , and devoid of street hawkers should have just stayed home .",1
"got tickets just by standing in queue for 1 hr , even during easter holidays .",1
"expect queues , everywhere from getting into the eiffel tower to when you are at the top wanting to come down .",1
you get access to the underground areas and lift machinery and then get the lift up to the second level where the guide leaves you to do as you wish .,1
we had prebooked summit tickets for the very reasonable price of $ 17pp .,1
"our guide , luca , was amazing !!!",1
"i was a bit scared , but it 's a solid structure underfoot and you feel secure walking around .",1
bucket list experience .,1
that was amazing !,1
it 's big metal and tall,1
eiffel tower is a must-go if it 's your first time to visit .,1
you ca n't go to paris without visiting the eiffel tower - it 's one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world .,1
"a must see , obviously for the photo op but there are much better views of it further away .",1
the weather was n't great - grey and misty - but the views were still incredible and the experience is one not to miss when visiting paris .,1
the eiffel tower is too beautiful to be real .,1
you can either brave the steps or save your energy and take the lift .,1
"we were in paris a couple of summers ago , and , since we only had a few days , skipped this one .",1
the scene was beautiful and the night lights of the city made it even better .,1
the other touts trying to sell you a cap when you 're waring one already ... there 's a lot of street graffiti on pillars and poles and the surrounding is n't maintained that we 'll either ... even the gardens at the rear of the tower are a sorry sight with minimal landscaping and full of cigarette butts and bottle crowns .,1
fantastic monument an absolute must see ... but not for us the two hour wait to visit the top .,1
the views on the day were worth the hike .,1
expect long cues during peak and weekends,1
we got a good distant night view from the bridges as well .,1
people jammed into the elevator and the levels were very crowded .,1
great to see and get a great view of the city .,1
"the security is part of western life and it was n't gustav eiffel 's original plan , but take this minor inconvenience on the chin .",1
definitely is a must to visit it .,1
absolutely loved the eiffel tower .,1
"when you see the eiffel tower , that 's when the feeling of being in paris finally hits you .",1
to me it 's not so special at day time .,1
walk along the siene river at sunset to soak in the beautiful view and reach the tower at night as the tower gets magically transformed into the color of gold by the light .,1
lighting was awesome .,1
we paid extra for a priority pass and that was money well spent as we saved considerable time in not standing in the queues .,1
as i was trying to get my purse open to put the change in i said `` thank-you '' and he picked up the 20 $ note and put it in the cash register !,1
"it cost 7 euros , and you can reach until the second floor .",1
"we have visited paris several times , but the first time we saw the eiffel tower it took our breath away .",1
went up to the top .,1
crowded and a bit of complicated street scene below -lrb- watch for pick-pockets -rrb- but do it once .,1
the first queue was the outer security barrier and airport security .,1
i had planned my europe visit in the summer months .,1
"many a visitor visits paris to see the eiffel tower , i have been there many times over the years , i would highly recommend touring this landmark at night .",1
"good to see security has been increased , we went through four points of checking before entering the lift areas -lrb- penknives and lighters were removed from other visitors and not returned -rrb- .",1
there is a bar/restaurant/shops up the tower so it makes for a good afternoon .,1
but do n't let it deter you from seeing this national monument .,1
they still walking around there ... carefull for tourist in paris .,1
"seriously , buy your tickets in advance online if you can .",1
food available as well as a very special restaurant reasonably priced,1
one must see the nightly light show as well .,1
"book & get in early to beat the tourists , watch out for the halkers selling things cheap , buy tickets online so much cheaper & go to the top if your able the sights are amazing .",1
no tickets available till late august !,1
suggest you pre-book online,1
the eiffel tower might not be very interesting in the daytime but is impressive at night .,1
the restrooms on this level are not crowded .,1
awesome view from champs de mars .,1
as you can imagine it a very busy place so i recommend you buy fast track tickets as we did and allow plenty of time as we were there for about 4 hours .,1
"2nd and third levels were incredibly busy , but only to be expected .",1
we were lucky to join a rather small queue on a sunday morning .,1
you can take the elevator or climb the stairs .,1
must see in paris !!!!,1
visited in october 2014 .,1
the weather was n't great and euro2016 fan zone nearby seem to dampen the whole experience .,1
"it is huge , intricate , and beautiful .",1
felt uneasy overall .,1
i selected the individual rates -lrb- there were 4 of us -rrb- and selecting the calendar date that we wanted to go .,1
but it actually worked out great .,1
could n't get so close because of sporting event .,1
"and please go to the top level , view is majestic .",1
the light show started while we were on top and it was an amazing experience !,1
"unfortunately it rained , was pretty chilly , and very windy .",1
# 13 for 2 adults and a child -rrb- .,1
also the glass floor was weird to stand in seeing below you,1
"if you do n't have a view of the tower at night , make it a point to go there to see it .",1
a quick elevator ride up you will have to takeadeep breath for the sight you are about to see .,1
looks nice but on a sunny day expect to be queuing up for a very long time while being harassed by street merchants and beggars .,1
"hit the top , the views are sensational , a must for anyone visiting paris .",1
the views are everything !!,1
"a must visit icon of paris , but prepared that there are lots of people and have to pay a fee to go up .",1
its worth wading through the street hawkers and the crowds .,1
want to go again,1
on a clear day you can see for miles in all directions .,1
-lrb- i was a poor college student then -rrb- now back with my kids i was happy to have to chance to go up .,1
or if well off have lunch at the jules verne restaurant and get your own private lift up .,1
of course this iconic point of interest was high on my list .,1
the eiffel tower is a great symbol of paris and the view from the top is spectacular .,1
"it is beautiful in the day , but spectacular at night .",1
"unless you are really hell-bent on going to the top of the tower , take my advice and just view it from a much nicer part of paris .",1
way overpriced for what it is .,1
"we have been to paris often and we love to walk around champ de mars , watching paris gather and play in the shadow of the gorgeous eiffel tower .",1
so you 're in paris and you do n't go to the eiffel tower - what 's wrong with you ???,1
you ca n't go to paris as a tourist and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
the views from thw top are definitely worth the wait .,1
i like it better at night when it is lighted .,1
very iconic !,1
thanks god they did n't .,1
we had lunch in the eiffel tower with a 5 minute wait .,1
they seem as if they cared and was sorry but they did n't really help us nor do i think they could have .,1
you need to be patient with some ignorant people especially at the lifts they just want you to push people in so they can get in themselves instead of waiting but european culture though !!!!,1
love to go there again whenever get a chance .,1
thoroughly enjoyed our time !,1
went up in the day time and the view of paris was beautiful .,1
worth a visit for sure .,1
i was there for new year 's eve 12/31/2015 .,1
"on the way down , skip the stop on the second floor .",1
"there is an incredible amount of tourist tat on sale , but ignoring that , the view is of course worth all the hassle and the experience is mandatory - at least once in a lifetime .",1
or spectacular ?,1
"the tower is lit up and sparkles every first five mins of the hour every evening , worth stopping by this amazing sight .",1
we loved seeing it lit up .,1
one of the most beautiful and breath taking experiences of my life !!!,1
went to the top .,1
"we had no issues here , but a lot of people had backpacks on their front and had locks on them .",1
but i am glad i did .,1
recommending to buy your ticket before .,1
booked in advance which made life easier .,1
went to the eiffel tower november 12th with my friends .,1
there are many queues from every direction and i do n't even know how long it will takes to queue .,1
i was lucky enough to go up in the evening and see the sunset and then paris at night .,1
the views from the top are endless .,1
"we went to paris on april and booked a hotel near by the eiffel tower , it was the best decision since we wanted to within a walking distance and visit the tower during the day and during the night , .",1
the place offers out of the world experience .,1
the view of paris once at the top is amazing especially on a clear day .,1
we did n't go up this trip but she still caught our attention from up close and other places in the city .,1
"the queue to go to the summit was ridiculously large and slow , which was very frustrating - we eventually gave up since we had little time .",1
on a clear day you can see all of paris .,1
simply wonderful .,1
"apart from the long queue to buy the tickets , the trip to the summit worth every minute .",1
the best way to really enjoy it is by having a meal at jules verne atop the second floor .,1
reservations are needed far in advance .,1
"go to the top for adult it is 17 eur , 12-24 age it is 14,50 eur and for children 4-11 age it is 10 eur .",1
"we visited paris 6 times over the year , we went up the tower 6 times .",1
we just walked straight in the gates 5 mins before our booked time and got in the lift .,1
next time i 'm in paris i 'll try to get up the tower but for my first visit i was simply blown away by it and ca n't think of any reason why anyone would fail to be impressed .,1
and thoroughly enjoyed the views from up there .,1
stop confiscating the possessions of law abiding citizens and either give them advance notice prior to cuing up or a way to retrieve them when they are done .,1
loved it as a child and visiting was more amazing than i could have dreamed .,1
we took the stairs up to the second floor instead of queuing for the lifts .,1
might have been lucky but ... .,1
we had tickets to the summit but we 're overwhelmed with the height on the 2nd floor so missed out on the top .,1
definitely need to buy tickets and go up to the top of the tower .,1
"yes of course , because the space up there is limited .",1
the line was so much shorter for the stairs .,1
however you still have to go to the top at least once .,1
how you can go to paris and not climb the iconic eiffel tower is beyond me !,1
"this is an iconic french and parisian structure , sadly i was unaware just how busy paris would be in august .",1
what an amazing contribution from gustav !,1
quite large in size it draws attention .,1
one word ... magical .,1
this is our second time to visit the eiffel tower but this time it is with the kids .,1
be ready for gobs of people and long ticket lines .,1
"a must-go-to attraction is paris , and for good reason .",1
"one of the most iconic buildings in the world , how can one go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower ?",1
"alighting from the trocadero subway station , we all had an `` eat your heart out '' view of the tower , only that there 's a huge renovation box disrupting the view .",1
we took selfies with the eiffel tower and it was amazing .,1
love this dont realy need to go up it amazing in day time but at night omg wait for on the hour lights watch from trocadero you wont be dissapointed,1
"we went to the first and then the second floor , walked around , beautiful view .",1
i would recommend a skip the queue ticket .,1
"i would recommend not to go if it 's a windy day , as the tour -lrb- at last level -rrb- moves and if u are scared of heights , u wo n't enjoy .",1
"the lines are long , so book ahead if you can .",1
"a must see world attraction , that draws you in the moment you see it .",1
this was a wednesday around 7 pm .,1
queues !,1
it is magical to see at night,1
we were so very excited to get here and be able to go up to the top .,1
prepare for extra security before entering !,1
whoa ... what a sight !,1
"lunch at 58 is fantastic with a great view , we sat on the trocadero side .",1
walked to the tower prior to visiting the louvre !,1
you can catch the lift or take the stairs -lrb- the brave -rrb- to the top .,1
"and we joined the queue , and went through another security point , and then into the lift and straight to the 2nd floor !",1
what an incredible experience to see the eiffel tower and walk around the area .,1
"choose a time , say 7:45 , be there at that time and walk in without waiting in line .",1
we learned a lot and our guide was pretty awesome !,1
"1 1/2 hours long , straight to the elevators .",1
found it at the end of a long walk and were lucky to get the sunset light show .,1
was lovely at night as it was all lit up and twinkling with christmas lights .,1
the trip to the top although pleasant was n't without trying my patience .,1
45 mins later or so i was then out of that queue and into elevator one .,1
there are long queue to purchase a on-the-spot ticket to go up to the tower with waiting time of more than 1 hour is not uncommon and worst on holidays and weekends .,1
walk across the street to get better pics .,1
"it look beautiful by night with all lights it shows , but that is everything .",1
it 's is a breath taking and i love it .,1
worth the effort .,1
very beautiful at night time .,1
it 's close to the train station and shops/restaurants .,1
"however , when we got there we found they had the tower fenced off all the way around and it really detract from the appeal and splendor of the attraction , plus the crowds around the tower are crazy !",1
up to to top is time consuming considering long queues .2 nd level gives good glimpse of the city .,1
i accidentally bought a ticket for the wrong day due to the rather rub bush website they have and they refused to change the date even though i raised the issue with client services minutes after buying the ticket .,1
a must do !!,1
this was a wonderful experience & one of the highlights of our 4 day visit to paris .,1
take the river cruise .,1
we went on our first day in paris during the afternoon and lined up for the elevator until we found out the top elevator was closed because of full capacity .,1
"we left dad and the 2,5 year old on the ground but they could probably have joined us without too much effort .",1
"impressed that it is n't over commercialised on the ground with food outlets etc. lifts take you to second level , where you change to upper level .",1
huge queues unfriendly staff .,1
amazed tour !,1
dont forget to visit the summit on the 3rd floor .,1
but it 's well worth it .,1
"we were unable to find tickets in advance online , so we were forced to wait in line .",1
paris looks amazing from so high ... .,1
it 's spectacular,1
make sure you are holding and keep your valuables close to you .,1
"i had been unable to pre book tickets online several weeks in advance of our visit , which i understand is a common issue and this was a great shame as the queues were very slow to get through security , which is totally understandable in the current climate , and we then had to queue again for a good hour and a half to purchase tickets .",1
the staff at the ticket office were so rude .,1
this time we made it to the summit .,1
when we got down to the ground level we walked away from tower to get some more photos .,1
that 's all we can say !,1
"the area is crowded , yet it 's a beautiful place to share with your loved one or just people watch while eating sweet pretzels and ice cream .",1
could do with more staff taking the money ... maybe the queues would move a bit quicker .,1
then up another floor to get another spectacular view .,1
"instead , the line for walking was empty .",1
"being our first visit in paris we decided to do all of the usual tourist traps , and rather luckily decided to prebook tickets -lrb- on many recommendations on tripadvisor ! -rrb-",1
do n't miss any part of the tower experience .,1
you see the paris view from top .,1
"also health permitting , the walk upto the second floor is so worth it .",1
"and the food was excellent , however we could n't finish all the wine they poured !",1
"at the top level , the view of the whole city is amazing .",1
we road the elevator to the 2nd and top floors and then back to the 2nd .,1
"try walking the stairs if your able , it is an experience you wo n't forget .",1
the views are great but you need to wait in long lines to get up and down .,1
happy to share that experience with my daughter .,1
"it 's so big and beautiful , however do go there early in the morning or in the evening , as in the afternoon the place is crazy packed with tourist and it will be hard for you to enjoy it fully .",1
beautiful iconic attraction in paris .,1
it 's quite a magical experience especially if you go at night the tower sparkles and you ca n't take your eyes off it .,1
it is situated on the 7th arrondissement of paris near champ de mars -lrb- 戰神廣場 -rrb- .,1
but trust me that time passes so quickly when you get chatting to other first-timers .,1
got to go up on the first batch .,1
"this time we approached from the park side and went straight to the ticket booths , with little harassment .",1
"for us , the line was too much to endure , so we strolled the lovely grounds , took hundreds of photographs from every imaginable angle , danced and played in the park , people-watched and had an otherwise extraordinary time basking in the shadows of this iconic masterpiece .",1
the lights at night is also very beautiful .,1
a bit of a wait but for me a dream come true .,1
"in the smaller park next to the eiffel tower you have to be aware for pickpockets and people , mainly girls , who come to you with a paper and the question to sign it .",1
yes it 's impressive and stunning at night but look out for the teams of girls asking for signatures for the deaf .,1
we did visit the actual grounds 2 years ago and were saddened by the carnival atmosphere which dragged down the experience .,1
"i had made a reservation for an actual tour through expedia and we were so exhausted that day and the weather was non stop rain , we ended up napping right straight through our 7:00 pm tour that i had prepaid roughly $ 100 for .",1
at night the lights flicker on the hour .,1
"also , best to visit around sunset in my opinion !",1
security let us through no bag checks -lrb- slightly worrying ? -rrb-,1
they are everywhere and very smart .,1
we went late in the day so there was n't a long line .,1
"on the ground , the line ups move fast and security keep people in line but once in the tower , we only saw staff at ticket check points .",1
money saved on walking was well spent on champagne at the top : - -rrb-,1
romantic picturesque place for couples definitely .,1
"one of the interesting spot for tourist and appear in some novels , comics , and films .",1
thos is the symbol of paris this is a remarkable statues of the world if it is clear wheather super paris wiev waiting youn do your boking on line before coming if not long waiting,1
i prefer to take friends and visitors on a boat ride with dinner and see the eiffel tower scintillating on the hour from the river .,1
"we arrived in paris on an evening , and after checking into the hotel we took the train down and saw the tower lit against the evening dim sky .",1
this is my second visit to the eiffel tower .,1
"no one could ever see everything , so find your top ten and be happy if you 're able to see them all .",1
"a word of caution , it is really windy from the top floor , so take an extra piece of coat with a hood .",1
we did not go up to the higher level because of the long line .,1
our pictures were spectacular !,1
"service was excellent from the at table staff , but the front house receptionist was snooty and unhelpful .",1
"the lift clanks and clatters upwards , revealing spectacular views of the city below .",1
definitely worth the time to go up the eiffel tower while in paris .,1
worth waiting in a row for going up .,1
the place to meet the guide was clearly defined and the young lady was there when she said she would be .,1
however be prepared to queue for a long time in high season to access the tower .,1
you should add it to your bucket list .,1
no question that the eiffel tower is a must see on a trip to paris .,1
there is no need for recommendation to this gigantic tower if you are in paris .,1
but i think this was a good thing primarily because the lines were not very long waiting for elevators .,1
the grounds surrounding the tower are very well maintained .,1
"also , if early enough , should n't be a problem getting access to the top .",1
a must see destination in paris !,1
a lot people of course and imigrants trying to sale over priced stuff .,1
the views looking over paris are so beautiful and you can see the full panorama .,1
"there is a souvenir shop but the prices are ridiculously expensive , and you can get the same items for cheaper elsewhere .",1
loved the view of the tower as well as view from the top .,1
the day we went it was raining so not a problem we went up .,1
beautiful views from an incredible location .,1
our trip included a small bus tour of inner streets -lsb- only small buses can manoeuvre such places -rsb- and all the famous landmarks as well as the cruise on the river seine only to be topped off by the fabulous luncheon -lrb- all expenses paid -rrb- and of course - the view .,1
"it is a must do if you 're in paris , common ... who does n't want to see the eiffel tower ????",1
i also saw a sweet little lady with her cross body open and slung behind her back .,1
this tower is number one to visit in paris !,1
surprisingly little wind at the top and amazing views stretching in all directions .,1
half the family walked down to ground via the steps and the rest got the elevator .,1
"views are spectacular , but take a jacket with you , as it was freezing up there !",1
"and it 's painted a terrible institutional fake bronze color , which does n't help .",1
unfortunately could n't go till top as the queue was huge to buy tickets .,1
we bought some sandwiches from a local store and enjoyed them in the shade .,1
everyone waiting expectantly for the setting of the sun behind the tower .,1
you can just see the tower from a different angle .,1
we have been there in april so maybe we have been very lucky but there was no queue at all to buy the tickets and only a 5 minute queue for the lift .,1
a much better view of the tower without all that stuff in the way .,1
"the lines for the ride stay long but that said , it means that anyone is able to go up and see this amazing city from the top of the eiffel tower .",1
the eiffel tower was breathtaking !,1
i did get to see someone propose to his gf right under the tower which was sweet .,1
"nighttime is also a `` must do '' if you have the time , but you will wait in line .",1
"stroll around and surprice yourself , do n't do what everyone else tells you !",1
two levels .,1
"excellent value , only cost us something like 18 euros for family of four .",1
it was fun though .,1
"we were able to get the tickets to second floor within 5-10 minutes , walked up the stairs -lrb- ~ 10-15min -rrb- to 2nd floor , then there was a very short line to purchase the ticket up to the top .",1
"but despite all this , it is worth seeing - ideally from up close to get a better view and an appreciation of its size .",1
i wanted to see it and possibly go to the restaurant .,1
easy to understand why it is so iconic .,1
we came by boat -lrb- a good choice -rrb- as part of the paris in one day .,1
looking right out at it .,1
a must see for your visit to paris !,1
certainly it is impressive and you are emotionally taken by its size and particularly by the amount of people who want to be able to take in such an amazing piece of world architecture period .,1
i did n't know the statue of liberty in ny was built using similar techniques and shipped to ny .,1
i want to visit again soon !,1
it is a wonderful end to any day in paris .,1
how could anyone visit the city of lights without climbing the eiffel tower ?,1
it took around half an hour to queue for tickets as we had n't booked in advance .,1
"we got the ticket to the top , the views are stunning , ticket price to second floor is 11 $ or 17 $ to top floor .",1
so amazing !,1
this was a birthday present to my husband who wanted to see the tower up close .,1
what a difference today .,1
"other than that there is n't much to see , it 's a tower",1
lighted up bright and view was amazing .,1
yeah sure !,1
interesting and informative .,1
everyone knows that there are great views but some things easy to forget are :,1
book in advance to avoid the queues !,1
"is something that you must visit , but be aware of the street vendors they can be really stressful and frightening",1
it is a definite `` must do '' when in paris ' and the cost will not break the bank .,1
"we kept returning to the tower at night to see the lights , and would grab a spot on the steps of the trocadero to take in the sights .",1
seriously awesome .,1
it 's very busy but worth it .,1
also great to see at night .,1
we did not stay at the attraction till sunset .,1
some interesting local characters and action around the periphery and across at the trocadero .,1
"also , we visited the park in front of the tower at 10 o clock and we saw the lighting show !!!!",1
go right to the top - its worth it .,1
"there are a lot of caricature artists around -lrb- but beware , they actually make true caricatures hat have no resemblance to you ! -rrb-",1
"we walked day and night , completely safe .",1
i had ridden to the top before and they did not want to .,1
"i thought this was very inconsiderate on behalf of the tour organisers , the fact that they would not dispell the bad weather conditions on a whim for me really damped my day .",1
really enjoyable 3 or so hours !,1
brilliant views .,1
"i only made it to deuxieme etage , could n't face the top !",1
"although climbing the eiffel tower would offer you a good panoramic view of paris , it could get pricey .",1
lots of pickpockets !!!,1
august is a great time to visit as many parisians are on holidays and the city is quieter than usual .,1
fab thing to do in this lovely city .,1
the very same views are different at every level which is kind of mind-blowing .,1
"lines to get up the tower are very long and once you get up , it is even more crowded with everyone packed into such a small space .",1
"still , it 's an icon that truly lives up to the hype .",1
brought the kids here on our tour of paris.the kids loved the park beside the tower.we did n't go up the tower because the line was too big.absolutely stunning at night .,1
"a must see for any trip to paris especially first , amazing beautiful .",1
the queues were quite long but the pay off was worth it to see some the greatest view of all paris in every direction as far as the eye could see .,1
"do n't get me wrong , going to the eiffel tower is very cool .",1
i still went up of course .,1
"also , the view is best from the champs de mars side of the eiffel tower .",1
defiantly worth the money .,1
if you 're not planning to buy then just say a firm no .,1
"i went with my wife last fall and it was rather cloudy , so we only went to the second level , as the top was in the clouds .",1
ths is our second visit to paris and eiffel tower .,1
"also , there is a great little restaurant just north one block along the river .",1
"oh man , what a feeling .",1
it 's a bit overwhelming but i 'm so glad we went !,1
"the views are still amazing , especially from the top level .",1
i recommend you to go there as well .,1
worth the long wait in line for a beautiful view of paris in every direction .,1
"we purchased our timed entry ticket online 90 days out , really easy .",1
such an impressive structure and enables amazing views of the city from even the first floor and second floors .,1
you can see out over all of paris .,1
obviously this is a must do for anyone who has n't gone up in the tower .,1
the tour guide was really good and had lots of interesting info about the tower and it 's history .,1
"you need to visit , is a most do it , and you will experience a super joy doing it .",1
great view easy to get from hotel transportation recommend great .,1
best view of paris can be seen from level 2 of tower,1
although the view makes up for both .,1
we lingered on each level .,1
the whole area around the tower is nice to just bring a snack and hang out for a few hours .,1
walk from where we were staying in the 7th arr .,1
"if you are here , you must climb on top of the eiffel tower .",1
"it 's not only an iconic spot , it 's useful !",1
the view is spectacular !,1
we brought tickets to use the elevator to go to the very top as we wanted to save our legs for walking around paris instead of walking up stairs .,1
it was a little chilly but we enjoyed the trip all the way to top .,1
"when i came back down , the lift stopped at another floor not very far from the bottom .",1
we waited about an hour and a half to go up .,1
better at night than day !,1
18 years after my first visit i returned and had booked months in advance so got up to the very top within 25 mins .,1
was very quiet at night time -lrb- around 11 pm -rrb- ❤,1
"although this iconic tower pops up into many vistas all over the city of paris , it is essential to get up close and personal to admire its unique architecture and special soft spot in this city 's passionate psyche .",1
"we chose fat tire bike skip the line tour to the top , otherwise it was easily a 2 hour wait , spent the extra $ so we could spend our time in other ways .",1
"it was busy but not overly so , about what you would expect .",1
i went to eiffel tower with lot of expectation and imagination but it was just an ordinary experience .,1
holiday season it sparks with thousands of led lights .,1
as we were leaving for brussels in a few hours by high speed train we returned to our room and packed for our trip .,1
as my daughters said you see in pictures and it 's amazing how the lights go on .,1
"because of them , i find it rather a bother to go there ... just look at it from a distance and enjoy that .",1
we were lucky enough to see it from our hotel!highly recommended,1
we enjoyed the ride up and the view at each landing .,1
the view is also spectacular and worth every euro : -rrb-,1
"we did n't go up , but the eiffel tower is very cool from the ground view as well .",1
there is something misterious about it !,1
"then , at the very top , wife and i indulged in some champagne as we got to take in the most gorgeous view of the city of lights all lit up at night .",1
"lovely & amazing , but you have to wait a long time to book a ticket , unless you have a group , not less than 20 persons , you can go & book your tickets from another place , just an advice : book a ticket for the third floor from the start as you have to c the view from above , it is wow",1
we firstly went up to the top - the view was amazing !,1
"while the food was not what we expected , the view certainly made up for it !",1
preferably book in advance so that you can use the fast-track queue and so that you do n't have to stand in lengthy queues for a ticket on the day .,1
long lineups to get to the top though .,1
service was prompt and courteous .,1
even though we bought the skip the line tickets we still waited 40 minutes then another 50 when queuing for the summit .,1
the view of the city is spectacular .,1
"the view of the city is breathtaking , to say the least .",1
the day we went was overcast and drizzly so the crowds were not bad .,1
lines move fast .,1
we were advised to arrive early to beat the rush and that was certainly a good idea .,1
"wonderful to climb to the top of tower by lift , great view to see all landscape of paris , nice atmosphere and birder around the ground , you can take alot of potos here for my memory trip",1
"having seen the huge queues for the tower whilst on the pen bus tour , new hubby and i were very reluctant to go up the tower at all -lrb- we 're not keen on crowds or waiting and dislike people quite a lot ! -rrb-",1
"also you must visit it during the evening , as well as the day .",1
we walked from rue de rivoli at about 3.30 pm and went up the tower at 4.30 pm .,1
"it was a dream for some of my friends , they totally enjoyed the experience .",1
of course its really a renowned landmarks of the world .,1
top view and great experience at the champaign bar .,1
"the eiffel tower is a wonderful site , bigger than i had thought .",1
"having said that , the 75 minutes in the queue on a warm sunny evening was enjoyable and allowed us to really take in the surroundings and the atmosphere .",1
very busy and top tier closed for a short time .,1
a definite must see and not to be missed experience .,1
a huge sense of history and wonderful views of paris into dusk .,1
we queued for hours to get in and wanted to go to the top.when we got to the end the queue we were told it was closed and only could go to second level.the staff seemed grumpy.when we got to the 2nd level they then said that we could queue for another half an hour and pay again to go the top.as it was to busy to pay at the bottom .,1
"had a spectacular view of the eiffel tower from our hotel , but to see it up close it was everything and more .",1
"we took a long walk from our hotel and arrived for our scheduled visit , we had ordered our tickets online .",1
"you can avoid this by buying your ticket online in advance , but the line moved quickly so it was n't so bad .",1
just enter the reserved entry avoiding the very long ticket line and head to on of the base areas to catch a lift .,1
what a sight .,1
"the iconic , unmatched beauty of the eiffel tower goes without saying , but the constant haggling to buy merchandise or sign petitions for donations took away from the view .",1
must do attraction can not afford to miss it .,1
great experience would recommend it .,1
coffee and pastries on the second level were surprisingly affordable -lrb- much cheaper than the louvre ! -rrb-,1
"i have visited the eiffel tower several times before , but i wanted to take my young son to see it .",1
the second time we came was at night because i wanted to see it sparkle .,1
best seen from the palais de chaillot .,1
then we got a chance to see some sections of the tower that are not open to the public .,1
"as we made our ascent , it never felt crowded .",1
"like saying , when friends or family asked around : `` paris !",1
get off the metro at trocadero to see a great view of eiffel at night .,1
we did n't actually go up in it because of time but will save that for another trip !,1
somehow the french do n't seem to know how to do run leisure facilities/historical / cultural trips quite as well .,1
we go up the tower every year .,1
the twinkling lights were amazing !,1
such a grand vista from all three stages - a real treat to enjoy this most historic structure - it enjoys a very spacious plaza complete with fountain and long water feature which reflects the tower - this is a '' must do '' visit for everyone who comes to paris,1
shooting up in the lift as the vertical columns draw closer and ever closer until they are tightly fitted around the elevator .,1
in day time as well as night .,1
there is a prebooked ticket queue and 2 different queues when we were there .,1
at ten am there was just a short line and we were on one of the elevators in no time .,1
"from a distance , close up , underneath , from the west , north , south or east , it does n't matter .",1
we especially enjoyed seeing all the families having picnics on the lawn .,1
it is a great attraction by day or night !,1
we did not go inside to take an elevator ride to the top but it is something we should have done but did n't see a need .,1
i got up at 1:00 am central to press the button .,1
the size is monumental !,1
the view of city from the top was excellent !,1
beautiful to see at night !,1
security has been stepped up since the nice incident which is good for safety but it takes away some freedom .,1
you absolutely must see it .,1
hiring a guide helps in understanding not just about eiffel tower but also about the rich parisian history .,1
it 's majestic !,1
there are tour companies which offers that .,1
weather was good when we came at 8am -lrb- for 9am opening -rrb- to line up .,1
and go early on the morning .,1
the queue for those who had n't prebooked was very long so i recommend booking before you go .,1
"first , get your tickets ahead of time on line .",1
"but expect long waits for security , to buy tickets and then to take the elevator",1
"not only will you get a fantastic view of paris , but you will see the inner workings of the elevator as it runs up and down , as you climb upwards .",1
eiffel tower looks awesome when i walked nearer to it near to river seine .,1
make reservations & enjoy fabulous views of a beautiful city .,1
this time from a different angle .,1
it 's high !,1
"lots of bothersome africans selling souvenirs , try not to interact too much .",1
my 3rd visit and the aura of the place does n't stop to fade away .,1
with few visitors at this hour we could walk at our own pace and were n't crowded in .,1
otherwise your wait will be ridiculous and you may end up disappointed .,1
was a bit confused by the pricing for each option of stairs/elevator ride .,1
there is nothing like paris at night .,1
make reservation at le jules vernes restaurant to enjoy the view on top of the tower .,1
it is free to walk around and under the tower however to go up there is a charge .,1
get your tickets in advance !,1
so glad we went .,1
i hear it is fabulous at night might be best to take a tour,1
it is a must see attraction and is deffo worth the visit but just plan it for a less busy time or book tickets in advance .,1
"if we did it again , we would have got off at the first level on the way down and walked down to get another perspective .",1
i was almost there for about 90 minuts and enjoying the view of paris from all sides of the tower .,1
we arrived with a skip the line tour that took us to the 2nd story of the tower .,1
"when we were there , at around 9pm there were lights playing up at the tower , makes it look super pretty !",1
take your drink of choice and munchies with you because you wo n't want to come down for a while .,1
be on guard for the hawkers who are persistent .,1
what can be said which has n't already been said about this iconic paris landmark .,1
great time .,1
it was on my bucket list .,1
i really enjoyed the seeing the eiffel tower .,1
beautiful both day and night .,1
night time is much more magical and less busy .,1
"this floor had a glass floor , along with a restaurant .",1
we even got to iceskating for free in the eiffel tower which was amazing .,1
and i recommend going to see it .,1
"at night , they also do a little show where the eiffel tower is lit up and sparkling .",1
as the lift was so awful on the way up -lrb- see 58 tour eiffel review -rrb- we walked down the stairs and it was actually quite scary to have a security guard walking down at the same time as you checking the structure of the metal was okay !,1
not worth it .,1
you can stay as long as you want .,1
you must see it both during the day and at night .,1
"the views were spectacular , could see for miles .",1
great place to grab a bottle of wine and lay in the park,1
better than i expected .,1
really is awesome up close .,1
one of those iconic structures that everyone has to see in their lifetime .,1
"we arrived just after noon on a weekday , but it was during christmas week , so it was crazy-crowded .",1
outside or inside it is stunning .,1
we went on the worst day for weather possible and it was still worth it .,1
we did not see the need to go up this time as we had both done this separately at different times .,1
recommend to take a thick jacket if you plan to go up .,1
very worthwhile .,1
but that was still an excellent view .,1
"we ordered `` skip the line '' tickets on-line , and our visit was smooth and enjoyable .",1
you can never imagine how it will be until you see in from your own eyes .,1
"it 's what you think it 's going to be , but much more gorgeous in person : -rrb-",1
it is n't necessary to go up the tower although the views can be spectacular .,1
fantastic view of paris .,1
we also avoided the lines once by booking a dinner at their fancy restaurant right in the tower ... its a bit pricey but the food is good and the view is the best .,1
and from the top it was like looking on the map of paris .,1
we went three times before we left paris .,1
we had a great trip to paris .,1
i went here on a monday afternoon .,1
dont miss the summit which takes you to the top floor of the tower .,1
you 'll lose that sentimental gift you 've had at your trusty side for twenty years and have to cope with it 's loss .,1
wait for 30 to 40 mins in line and await turn .,1
worst case i would have to purchase a river cruise which included a visit to the eiffel tower for about 50 eur per person -lrb- not that i had the budget for that -rrb- .,1
we were impressed just by the sheer size of the structure .,1
you have to visit to this place to know why it is in the list of 7 wonders .,1
the first time i saw the eiffel tower was in 1999 when a friend and i visited for the first time .,1
worth the money !,1
"very crowded , but the only way to go is on a skip the line tour .",1
the eiffel tower is definitely a destination while in paris .,1
truely amazing man-made masterpiece .,1
the eifel tower is really an amazing place and very beautiful .,1
"otherwise , the lines are long for an elevator ride .",1
there is alsoa little film about the eiffel tower that is worth the watch .,1
it 's fun spotting famous parisian landmarks from a bird 's eye view .,1
i mean it 's a tall building with nice views of surrounding paris - that 's it .,1
we arrived at the eiffel tower at 9 am -lrb- when it opens -rrb- only to find the lines for the elevator to be miles long already !,1
we happened to be in the area at night and stopped by about 5 minutes before the hour .,1
a trip to this wonderful landmark .,1
this was a fantastic way to go as it meant we skipped the 3 hr queue for a ticket on the day and got the benefit of a guide who explained the history and background to the tower and spent time pointing out different landmarks visible and also the history of those places as well .,1
views from the summit make the wait in long queues worthwhile .,1
"this is history , what can somebody tell you about eiffel tower ??",1
definitely worth it though .,1
the view at the top was amazing !!!!,1
"skipped the line and followed our english speaking guide to the second level , then off to the summit !!",1
"during the day it 's also amazing but at night , when it lights up .",1
if anything the tour was too short could of spent another hour learning about the area .,1
went to the summit .,1
"we opted to take the stairs down , which we and the kids loved .",1
it offers a nice view of the seine river and the eiffel tower at once .,1
"some people say `` it looked so much smaller than i thought ... '' , i had quite the opposite , standing at the foot of the north pillar , the eiffel tower rising up high into the clear blue sky .",1
"i 've been to the eiffel tower several times , but never with a tour guide .",1
perfect !!,1
second time i 've ever been to paris and second visit to the eiffel tower .,1
ws very organised too and cery busy,1
there is something magical about the tower that you do not realize until you see it up close and personal .,1
it is so beautiful .,1
the symbol more associated with paris .,1
"also , go to the glass floor on the first floor .",1
still there were some srowded tourists around and the weather was nice .,1
it is just so beautiful to look at ... what more can i say ?!?!,1
it 's become that thing you have to do .,1
we went in the early evening around 5pm and lucked out with virtually no line .,1
well this review is more like a diary entry rather than a review .,1
a bucket list item to check off .,1
wear comfortable walking shoes if you choose to do the stairs instead of the lift .,1
we also got a chance to go underground to the radio telegraphic center used during the war .,1
what trip to paris is complete without seeing the eiffel tower ?,1
"never had vertigo until that point , i think it was the number of folk in a confined space up brilliantly high .",1
wanted to visit for so many years .,1
i came to paris for the weekend .,1
i suggest you book tickets online beforehand to get a little ahead in line .,1
the dinner was fantastic .,1
i 'm so glad i had the experience .,1
"the views of paris are excellent , and gave us a new appreciation for how far the city extends in all directions .",1
"if you time it well and get to the top just before the sunsets , the eiffel tower is worth it !",1
"i did not go to the top or eat in the restaurant but no matter , it is like a beautiful centerpiece that must be admired .",1
we went on a tuesday night and had a small wait for tickets .,1
this was a great place to visit while in paris .,1
we did n't really see the first or second levels because of the overcrowding .,1
we walked to the second platform and back down 600 steps -rrb- .,1
be careful here as lines are long so can be a long wait which for elderly and young children is difficult .,1
we really enjoyed stopping off at the level 2 on the way back down and having a leisurely drink and rest .,1
if this is your first time to paris you have to see it ... but be prepared .,1
"and everywhere we went , they saw the souvenirs of the eiffel and they must have gotten about 10 key chains -lrb- a few i bought , and several given to them for free when i bought other stuff since my girls so charming i guess ?! -rrb-",1
every panoramic view includes her .,1
"since this was the first time for our son , we decided to pre-book our tickets to access the second level via lift .",1
more information about the tower to read as you go around would have been nice as we ended up googling for answers to kids questions .,1
2 1/2 hours just to purchase the ticket .,1
can spend as much as time you want to .,1
the monument is situated at perfect location with some of the most expensive streets as its surroundings .,1
"it is also great in the day , but nothing beats how it looks at night .",1
"if you can , take the stairs ... it 'll save you a headache making the queue for the lift up , it 's good exercise , and it 's a lot of fun .",1
"but the experience is beautiful , you can see the city go on forever !",1
"we did the stairs , and likely would have waited for the lift .",1
"and keep a close grip on your wallet / handbag , especially in lines for the elevator .",1
both are worth it .,1
and watching the frenzied matches of the euro 2016 on the large screen with tour eiffel in the backdrop was an experience of a lifetime ... .,1
this is where u can purchase tickets to continue up to the top .,1
"it is fairly crowded , however the crowds dont seem to purchase the ticket to ride all the way to top .",1
please make reservations ahead of time as they generally do not have any spots available if you walk in .,1
"named after the engineer who built it , eiffel tower is the most enduring symbol of paris .",1
"i was only in paris for a couple of days really , but going up the eiffel tower just had to be done .",1
i think it 's better to do a boat trip .,1
we took the elevator up and walked the stairs down .,1
we walked the 1st two floors and took the elevator to the top and watched the sunset overlooking paris .,1
be mesmerized .,1
the view was incredible and well worth the wait in line .,1
"we paid 17 $ euro to go to the top , the line was short , the wait to get up was minimal and everything was smooth and efficient .",1
make sure you are tipsy before asking for the bill !,1
ran on time .,1
make sure to visit with a loved one !,1
we went at night and the city of lights did not disappoint .,1
"hotel odeom was a great place to stay ... very friendly staff , nice rooms , good food .",1
we enjoyed it even more on a day when the crowds were thin .,1
there are souvenir shops in the tower with some stuff surely worth picking .,1
"quite spectacular at night , with the tower all lit up .",1
you get lesser crowds and the tower in daylight and at night .,1
i must admit that paris is the most beautiful,1
we enjoyed our time at this icon .,1
first floor we enjoyed must with a on 3 screens showing the history of the tower .,1
"it takes a trip just for this spectacular , unique , awesome , huge , breathtaking masterpiece of modern art .",1
bought `` skip the line '' tickets and it is well worth doing that as the queues for those waiting to buy tickets were long.it was a cool sunny day and you could see for miles .,1
all in all a great experience .,1
also had the added bonus of pretty twinkling lights .,1
great to see .,1
incredible sights both of and from the tower .,1
i 've been to the eiffel tower on previous occasions so not really fussed but my recent visit was a pure shambles .,1
we probably got up to the top and back down in the time some people were still in line .,1
"it was an amazing experience , everyone was super friendly !!",1
i am huge fan of the eiffel tower !,1
after our dinner and as we reached the bottom of the eiffel tower the lights lit up and began to twinkle .,1
a must do if you are coming to paris .,1
we could only go half way due to the weather but the views were nice .,1
"having seen the eiffel tower in daylight , i must say i was very disappointed .",1
be aware of the wind and cold -lrb- at least in the winter -rrb- .,1
"interestingly the french think it 's an eyesore , but without that eye sore i seriously doubt many people would ever visit paris , and normally not more than once .",1
"i visited the tower twice in 2 years and this time around , i went all the way up .",1
the sparkling light show makes the tower extraordinary enchanting and the viewers enthralling .,1
always keep an eye on your belongings and your loved ones .,1
we had as much time at the top of the tower as we wanted .,1
beware of courteous teenage gypsy girls in a team of 5 to 6 trying to get you to donate for disadvantaged children at the fringe of the location .,1
the views are beautiful .,1
the views are staggering and a must do on a trip to paris !,1
a must see landmark .,1
although the crowds were quite offputting .,1
"if you really want to experience eiffel tower , reached at that place in early evening , stay there till 8:00 .",1
this was my 5th visit to paris and i finally went to the top of the eifel tower .,1
"if you can , make the trip to the summit !",1
this is an iconic touristic masterpiece .,1
these were delicious and far less expensive than the rubbish take away options available at the tower .,1
going on a weekday at 9:30 am may have helped,1
we went on a monday morning -lrb- as most shops are shut on a sunday in paris -rrb- and to try to get up the eiffel on a weekend day would have been a long wait .,1
there are signs everywhere warning of pickpockets that does tend to detract from the experience .,1
it 's not a good opportunity to take photographs of the tower itself unless you approach from the ` mall ' side close to the military school .,1
"another suggestion is to visit eiffel at night , the city and the tower is in lights and so pretty !",1
incredible !,1
we did a walking tour with flat tire tours and we learned so much about the tower from the walk and even more once we got up .,1
book in advance if you want to go up the tower at decent times .,1
plus the best part of the paris skyline is the eiffel tower so when you are up there you obviously ca n't see it .,1
"the tower lights up at midnight with thousands of tiny white lights creating a dazzling effect which is pretty , worth taking shots of that too .",1
but mind your zipper !,1
it was worth it !,1
"for the fee we paid , we where very glad to see all the attractions by night .",1
wonderfull construction and view of paris from the top !!,1
"it is well worth the wait and the fee for the elevator , you ca n't walk up anymore .",1
no need to book in advance for the top of eiffel tour .,1
we visited the eiffel tower on a tuesday morning and had no lines .,1
"when we turned the corner and looked down the street , the tower was standing tall and beautiful at the end of the street and it took my breath away with its gigantic beauty .",1
i could not believe the inpact the tower has on paris .,1
it 's very difficult to book the tickets on the official website as they are sold out in no time .,1
choose to walk to the second deck instead of taking the elevator to save some money - the queue is shorter and it 's really not that tough .,1
it is a pain waiting on lines .,1
"at 11 pm the tower was illuminated with a small light show , i loved it !",1
"would need ashtrays in the area , lots of cigarette butts everywhere , enjoyed the boat rides along the seine and the hop on hop off bus tours .",1
so we opted for the stairs !,1
we followed the suggestions of some folks on this forum and got there a bit early -lrb- ~ 8:30 am -rrb- and waited at the south entrance to walk up to the second floor .,1
liked everything ... .,1
had to go through a bit of security -lrb- not as much as i would 've liked -rrb- a brief bag search and then we began walking !,1
it 's the eiffel tower for cryin ' out loud .,1
i had an most amazing time there .,1
their guides are knowledgeable and know their way around the city .,1
"the queue for the tickets was quite long , as there were none left online , and only one tickets office open ... .",1
if u want to go on 2nd top of eiffel tower then u should have 4 to 5 hours free .,1
the tower itself is great to see at night .,1
awesome view although it was a little chilly at the top .,1
will go there again for sure .,1
"paired with a boat ride of the seine , the eiffel tower makes for a quintessential parisian experience .",1
we had to go to see it .,1
and then another 10 mins .,1
how can anyone possibly give the eiffel tower anything but 5 stars ??,1
"but the first level was higher than anything around it , so the view was fantastic .",1
it 's a really romantic place and specially during the night !,1
the experience and views never get old !,1
worth every euro for the entrance .,1
unforgettable .,1
we arrived at trocadero station at 9 and caught sunrise at the tower it was breathtaking .,1
we were even interviewed by some students researching on how people felt over it 's closure .,1
"wow , what an incredible view !",1
the app was a great enhancement to the visit .,1
"first , there is impressive security all around the tower these days .",1
but the trip to the tower may take longer due to the queue to access the stairs/elevator .,1
:d,1
book your tickets beforehand or face waiting in queues forever !,1
from the arc de triumph so you are better coming up here at night to beat the crowds !,1
we went again at night to view the tower with its lights .,1
"nothing more , nothing less .",1
indulge yourself with a glass of champagne and take in the views .,1
"my partner and i visited last year , and couldnt believe how overcrowded the place was.hardly any queue lines open and the organisation of people was shocking .",1
to coin a cliche a must do,1
the barricades and ticket selling sheds underneath the tower are a total eyesore and no longer can you wander in and get that photo looking directly up into the tower unless you 've paid for a ride .,1
the gardens around make a perfect place for a picnic .,1
"but remember , it only shows for 5 minutes long at each hour .",1
go midweek during lunch or dinner -lrb- after the coach tours have departed -rrb- .,1
once we were done we watched the eiffel tower light show .,1
"enjoyed a beautiful day and shared a glass of champagne on my wife 's birthday , the crowd was very calm which was nice .",1
if you want to go to the top book ahead of time as it was always full so we couldnt go up .,1
"the surrounding grounds are less than attractive , filled with illegal street vendors , selling cheap trinkets on filthy blankets , if they 're not busy running from passing disinterested police .",1
a delayed review as i went here the first time in september 2014 .,1
this still allows you to skip all lines and once you are on the 2nd level you can purchase a ticket to the top from the booth on this 2nd level .,1
there is a metro station that will bring you right at that spot .,1
"i recommend a trip to the top during dusk in the summer , and then photography from afar as the sun settles behind the paris horizon .",1
"when you pass all check points , you can choose to use eleveator or stairs .",1
"that said , the eiffel tower is beautiful , and so is paris , and yes , i am so happy i saw it !",1
"rivets , pulleys , etc. .",1
"long lines to get in and buy tickets , scam artists , and huge crowds were a great distraction from this landmark",1
we could go up it as it was set up for the euro 2016 championships .,1
there is a couple of restaurants and a gorgeous view in the middle of the tower .,1
"highly organized we took the elevator to the first floor , they gave us a very nice table overlooking the seine river .",1
she led any who wanted to follow to the 2nd floor where she explained the view in every direction as we walked around the 4 sides .,1
i want to see your husband .,1
what a place .,1
elevators going up are extremely crowded - be careful of pick pocketers .,1
i recommend doing at the day time and then going back at night to see it light up from the ground .,1
"climb , do n't take the elevator ... its not just the view but the audacity of the era it was made in .",1
do n't queue up for 1.5 hours for the lift to take you up .,1
views from the top are amazing .,1
"if your trip allows it , try doing the eiffel tower at night as well as in the day time .",1
even with cold winds and clouds views were amazing from the top .,1
something everyone needs to do at least once .,1
but recommended that you go at the top even though paid,1
visited at day and night both,1
be prepared for security on every place in paris including shops and washrooms .,1
"just like most folks , come to paris and go up to the eiffel tower , we join a tour with a guide , the waiting was over an hour or more to reach the top , you can see as far as your eye can see , paris is beautiful .",1
"going up in the tower is a must , even if you 're afraid of hights !",1
we also saw it at night and it was truly beautiful .,1
just before arriving in paris we thought we could get online tickets but they were already sold out 3 months in advance !,1
you have to go if you are in paris .,1
visiting is something you simply must do in paris .,1
visiting the eiffel tower is a must .,1
the lighting and the feel when you are at the top is amazing .,1
and do try to get up to the top floor .,1
at night it is lit up and has a series of sparkling lights providing a show .,1
not sure about climbing it though .,1
do n't try to go up in summer .,1
"although it can take a few hours to get up and come back down again , its a must if it is your first time in paris .",1
and the number of people selling light up tin models of the tower at the bottom was annoying .,1
we took some great photos from the edge of the seine .,1
"then be prepared to feel a little sick when taking the elevator to the very top , because it will probably make your stomach queasy .",1
a visit to paris is n't a visit to paris without a visit to this magnificent piece of workmanship .,1
"there are a lot of street vendors trying to sell items , but a polite `` no '' gets them to back away .",1
i called the day before and they told me where to go .,1
my 10 year old loved it .,1
once at day to take amazing photos at the top .,1
outside the pesky folks selling goods outside .,1
the iron structured eiffel is impressive .,1
"a must see , go to the top ... not as bad as you would think !!",1
"because of the terrorist attacks , the eiffel tower was closed and not lighted at night .",1
many selfies of this metal masterpiece .,1
a truly must see .,1
"warning , do not take cans or glass bottles in your bags as you go through security and they will remove either of those items and you will lose them .",1
time for the city to clean it up .,1
the tower was pretty cool even though we did not bother with going inside it .,1
the top of the arc de triomphe is an excellent place to view the tower .,1
got there at 6.45 in order to watch the sunset .,1
this was made a good experience because i booked in advance through `` get your guide '' which saved long queuing for tickets .,1
the views from the top of the tower are unforgettable .,1
we loved the visit and spent about two hours .,1
it was so bad when we visited that the tower workers went on strike for a day -lrb- and shut down the tower -rrb- to protest the lack of security and the proliferation of petty crime .,1
"but if you want to see the eiffel tower , then you do n't need to go up it .",1
"as a result , we stopped at the 2nd floor which you can access by elrevator or on foot and the views are great !",1
the eiffel tower is the icon of paris .,1
a must visit when in paris .,1
the view from 1st floor is also exciting !,1
"only downside is you have to be on your guard for the pickpockets and gypsies who roam the plaza trying to rip you off , given the chance .",1
it is fun and beautiful .,1
this time just took pictures from below .,1
we went on a rainy day so there wasnt that many people .,1
i didnt want to wait in line with a toddler so didnt go up but had a great experience nevertheless at the bottom with the park surrounding it and the little market selling bits and pieces on the side .,1
we stayed close by so saw the tower light up at night .,1
"whether you visit early or not , there are queues .",1
it 's worth the wait in every way .,1
a trip to the city of lights would not be complete without paying this icon a visit .,1
husband booked a little surprise trip to paris from the south of france .,1
"we did not book ahead , i would recommend it .",1
one must not be there to be served and one will never be there to find himself alone enjoying the eiffel tower all by himself .,1
it is stunning .,1
this is one of the most iconic towers in the world .,1
"overall , the tower itself is stunning and a must see .",1
i would recommend a visit to paris to anyone .,1
we could see how high we could go .,1
we visited paris and the eiffel tower last september and were not disapointed .,1
`` the city of lights '' is an ideal city for a romantic excursion .,1
we visited this amazing landmark late january and opted to get the elevator to the summit .,1
we had 650 stairs up .,1
next time will be longer .,1
i loved the special lighting at the top of the hour .,1
you ca n't visit paris without climbing eiffel tour !,1
"the eiffel tower is a cool thing to see in paris , but i would wait until things calm down before visiting paris , in general .",1
"it is fairly close to various metro stations , so is very accessible .",1
it 's a once and a lifetime experience for many and i highly recommend going to take a look before you leave town .,1
an iconic tower and the most happening place in paris .,1
would definitely like to go to the top and see the view .,1
definitely not one to miss !,1
then over to the trocadero for a great view before catching the metro back the the hotel .,1
this is my second time here in a few years .,1
"with the recent events in paris , security is quite visible on the premises .",1
it began to clear up when we arrived .,1
effial tower is a must if visting paris it it is beautiful and must be seen in the day and night time has the lights make it look so pretty never went up as feel we didnt need to .,1
"my sister and niece arrived about half an hour before opening , and all was well .",1
"when we arrived home , i am sure that we had over 50 photos of the tower from all angles and distances and during the day and night .",1
champagne at the top of the eiffel tower !,1
next i 'm going to some building that has a bunch of old paintings in it .,1
that aside - it 's so worth it when you get up the tower .,1
"once we got to the second level and realized we could see everything from there , and in clearer detail than at the top , we called it good !",1
from tourists taking pictres to people selling cheap souvineers .,1
it was a steep climb but the views were worth it .,1
you have to get summit access and make sure you get your tickets in advance it is worth every penny !!,1
the best time to visit the eiffel tower is around 8 p.m. on the weeknights .,1
the tower is huge and so impressive !,1
must see at night !,1
make sure to buy your tickets ahead of time in order to save time in the queues !,1
oh !,1
it is def a must go see .,1
"you can judge by yourselves with this video of the eiffel tower from the top all the way down , just look for viajero360 in yout ... hope you like it .",1
it was overcast this first time .,1
"this was a lifelong dream of mine as it was also my birthday , which made it an even more magical occasion .",1
the eiffel tower is amazing at night .,1
"dinner was really good , if a bit expensive -lrb- but you ca n't beat the view ! -rrb-",1
i used the stairs to the second floor and even though the walk was tiring once again it was worth it !,1
"by the way , just before entering , i bought a small bottle of water .",1
"we were in paris for 4 days and each of these days went near the eiffel tower and spend few hours near it , there 's a river that 's flowing near it .",1
we all know this .,1
at first i thought it was some kind of iron but altogether but when i arrived to the site i realized how majestic the tour eiffel really was .,1
it 's very surreal to actually see in person and the view from the top is really breathtaking !,1
for my 15 years old doughter it was the first .,1
we had three hours in paris at the end of a week mostly spent in normandy .,1
by skipping the line at the eiffel tower it allowed us to spend more time at the louvre .,1
incredible view :-o .,1
also they do a security checkup in the entrance .,1
magical !!,1
we were at the second highest level of the tower when over the tannoy a siren started and asked people to make their way down the stairs due to a security alert but not to panic .,1
we decided to listen to her talk since we had paid a lot of extra money for the tour and the skip the line tickets .,1
there was hardly anyone in line and we went straight to the top .,1
here are the pro tips to getting the most out of the eiffel tower .,1
"we saw the best views from the summit and second levels , anyway .",1
hence skipped .,1
"if you 're scared of heights like me , do n't take the stairs down !",1
glad we did it but not as magical as i had hoped .,1
it was very crowded and freezing on the platform but so worth it .,1
"this tower is simply beautiful , imposing and so graceful !",1
"however it will be hard to even stand there on a rainy or windy day , on sunny day , it is pretty much full of people .",1
"the first was at night and the tower was stunning with all the lights on it , i also liked the walk up to the tower - loads of people where sat on the grass with wine and food having fun with groups of friends .",1
"the walks was long but easy , fresh and beautiful .",1
the sight is great as you approach .,1
"like a magnet , visible from different corners of the city , it attracts you 'till you are there , patiently waiting for that moment in which -lrb- at night -rrb- townsends of lights illuminate the hole tower and you can say : i got it",1
they security is understanderably very high with our bags going thorough x ray searching which was reassuring .,1
met the guide a few mins walks from the tower and then accessed the tower quickly as expected .,1
our 6 and 8 year olds loved the experience despite the waiting to start the experience and queues for each lift on the way down .,1
rightly put in the seven wonders list .,1
felt like a sardine in the lift but it 's to be expected during busy times .,1
it is difficult to judge the length of time it will take you to get through the queues but we fluke d it perfectly to be up the tower just before and during sunset .,1
be warned !,1
it was n't my first time but i am always in awe .,1
it is not as tall as you would imagine but it still takes a place of prominence in the landscape and horizon .,1
seeing it right in front of me gives me a feeling that i can not explain .,1
"okay so first off i do have a fear of heights so going up the eiffel tower was n't the smartest move , that said my partner tony loves high buildings and i knew he was excited about going right to the top so i agreed .",1
worth the wait as you get a totally panoramic view of the city .,1
this is a must do ... go to the top ~ wait in the line and purchase the over priced champagne .,1
"as a metal tower , it is n't very attractive unless you climb to the top and get a great view of paris on a clear , sunny day .",1
must see must climb tourists attraction .,1
but the view is beautiful !,1
"while it is an engineering marvel , i was left unimpressed by the structure which , to me , looked quite ugly !",1
"spent some time on the first level where you can sit and relax , grab a bite to eat .",1
we waited for our elevator at the 2nd floor .,1
i could stare at the eiffel tower all day .,1
"unfortunately the top lever was closed , but levels 1 and 2 were excellent .",1
so we took chance .,1
"its a trademark in paris , the gardens are amazing for drinking wine outdoor",1
it is an icon and a sight to behold .,1
best time to visit with no crowds is winter .,1
it was nice during the day and from the 3rd floor .,1
"we went up to the top of the tower , great view and a romantic experience .",1
"eventhought i 've seen eiffel several times , it 's still a must .",1
"unlike past visits when we have waited for a couple of hours , we went from joining the queue to getting out of the lift -lrb- on the 2nd level -rrb- in about 15 minutes .",1
food was good and the view was great .,1
we purchased tickets where we did n't have to wait to go to the second floor .,1
there are three levels each giving a vantage point over much of paris from different perspectives .,1
"when we arrived , i was surprised at how lovely it was .",1
it 's a must visit .,1
amazing picturesque and romantic views .,1
paris is always known as the most romantic and fashionable place ... and of course it 's true ... the seine river cruise and the view from the top of eiffel tower during sun set is all u need for an awesome memory ... it 's best to visit eiffel tower during sun set and seine cruise must be done at night to completely enjoy the beauty of paris ... the chill breeze and ur partner by ur side .,1
of course we had to get a crepe and enjoy the view !!,1
visited during the day to see paris view .,1
"but we just stayed in the bus since they take you around the island -lrb- yes , it 's on an island -rrb- and it circles the entire eiffel tower .",1
the views were worth it .,1
shopped in the gift shops and went back down .,1
people were crowding and cutting the line/cue and it just strung randomly in any direction instead of having some direction .,1
walked up to the window bought the tickets and went to the top .,1
we went 3 times to try and get in and all times were really really busy .,1
a bit disappointing but i saw the reflection of the tower in the clouds - which is apparently a rare observation .,1
you can do the stairs to the second floor and then an elevator to the summit .,1
but it 's gorgeous and i could n't give it a bad rating !,1
so beware !,1
must do in paris - we did enjoy this and ate in restaurant in first floor which was ok .,1
this is my dream place ever since i know about paris .,1
"maybe if i stay near and come so early in the morning so i do n't have to see the huge crowd , maybe it will be a different experience .",1
the line was shorter than the other entrances if you forget to book your ticket in advance .,1
visit all the floors .,1
"we visited paris in the peak of the tourist season , and we were happy to just see tour eiffel instead of climbing it .",1
then have a great time in one of the coolest constructions ever made .,1
"if u are patient to brave the queues , the breathtaking views are worth it",1
views from the second floor were worth the climb .,1
"amazing place to visit if you 're ready for queuing for hours , worth waiting though as it was an unforgettable experience and views are breathtaking",1
"in my view , there are probably better ways to spend an afternoon in paris and see the city .",1
the view from the second floor is just as good as the one from the top so unless the queue for the second floor lift is short do n't bother with it .,1
"the champagne bar was closed - which was to be my rewarded , was n't too happy about that !",1
view eiffel from trocadero - such an amazing view .,1
during the day it is one experience and at night it is a whole different experience .,1
in my opinion it 's the most beautiful place to visit in paris ... and a life experience !,1
i saw a few suspicious men looking over my friend 's shoulders to see where they kept their purses and then saw them scoping out other people .,1
the hourly light show on the tower is nothing short of spectacular !,1
"it was so interesting to learn that she the tower was built , the plan was to tear it down in 5 years .",1
so cold from 2nd floor and all around .,1
i 've been there in february 2016 in my first trip to paris .,1
much more security than the last time i visited but due to the cold weather and early time security and ticket purchase were quickly completed .,1
this is another must see .,1
you can also haggle as i bought two key rings and a large flashing one for $ 5 .,1
this was great to visit .,1
it is a simply a magnificent sight .,1
walk around it .,1
we advice to visit in the evening .,1
"booking the eiffel tower tickets ahead of time on-line is a must , as the wait is otherwise prohibitive with young children .",1
you need to walk around and take a quick shot .,1
i had a small tripod but did n't really use it .,1
you need to reserve a ticket on time to get it during the day .,1
i 'm not keen on heights anyway .,1
you will find the exact same items on the ground along the side with no wait .,1
buy tickets in advance to avoid hours waiting in line .,1
we was only waiting about 30 mins until we got in the lift which is very good and this was on a saturday morning .,1
but besides that its a fabulous atmosphere to stroll around and enjoy,1
so be careful !,1
if you really want to go to the top just go during sun set and you will have the best and breathtaking ever,1
staffs are rude !,1
i drank champagne on the top !,1
its worth paying for a skip the line which you can do only to the 2nd floor .,1
people taking selfies will hold up the lines .,1
stiff prices up at the second floor but try the macrons !,1
"it is a must for couples , families , and anyone for that matter .",1
we arrived at the pont de sevres metro station turned the corner and there it was .,1
this was one of the highlights of our trip to paris .,1
we joined a tour that gave you skip the line access and tickets to go to the very top .,1
i ca n't imagine a saturday ! -rrb-,1
the view is incredible with a 360 degree view of paris and the siene river and its many boats .,1
we bought the skip the line package deal through viator .,1
the day time slot was 10am and it was n't too busy so i only waited about 5 mins in the security and lift queues .,1
awesome to watch eiffel tower was twinkling at night .,1
"try to go early , 9am when it opens , when it is not crowded inside the tower .",1
"my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our dinner in jules verne , a very fine dining restaurant in the eiffel tower .",1
this was a good idea as it was very busy .,1
most go see it for yourself !!,1
crowded but the line moves fast .,1
the eiffel tower is the main attraction spot in paris .,1
the lines were n't too long and it 's a great way to view the city .,1
amazing architecture that went in to this tower !,1
best viewed from across the river during the day -lrb- also great photo opportunities -rrb- and from tour montparnasse by night .,1
went early in the morning to avoid the que .,1
the tower was beautiful from the top and bottom .,1
"in the surrounding area there are lots of groups of people enjoying the view , great atmosphere however there was a huge litter problem in the garden areas .",1
just be cautious and use common sense .,1
i may need to be pinched because i do n't think it 's real ... i do n't think i 'm really here .,1
view for 2nd floor is good too .,1
"the place was buzzing with people , huge lines for going to the top .",1
i can stare at it for the whole night especially when its twinkling lights are on .,1
we did not go all the way up as it was very very cold and windy and the line to go further up was quite long .,1
"but for the other 98 % , do yourself a favor and splurge on the restaurant 58 lunch or even better , dinner .",1
i have been there thrice and on all occasions this spectacular tower reminded me the fine engineering of french republic .,1
"when you get to the summit , the cold winds and amazing view of the paris skyline will meet you .",1
theres cool little shops and cafes around it .,1
revisited in the evening to see it lit up .,1
this is a must see for all visitors .,1
"on my return trip , i will not go back up again .",1
"there was a 1 hour wait for us -lrb- we bought tickets at the venue , not online -rrb- but that is n't a big deal .",1
"cold and windy the day we visited , but the eiffel tower is exactly the landmark you have envisioned .",1
what is it ?,1
we went up to eiffel tower at night time .,1
we were even surprised with some complimentary ice skating on level 1 on our way down .,1
how can you not come to the eiffel tower when you come to paris ?,1
the second time we went to go up into it we bought a lunch package at the tourism booth and with that you get to skip the long line .,1
"it is for sure a place you have to visit when in paris , but it did n't live up to its reputation .",1
you have to visit its first floor with glass flooring .,1
i have always love paris for their view of eiffel .,1
well done everyone !,1
it has been years since i first desired to visit this iconic landmark .,1
"its my second time to visit eiffel tower , and i was still amazed with its beauty .",1
also you can take the elevator/lift back down from the second floor even if you got a stair pass,1
remember to check the weather before you go up .,1
i 've been chased for doing just that .,1
"simple , interesting facts , look for her history with mata hari during the war .",1
why should that be ?,1
this is a good habit anywhere .,1
even better when you go get closer to the tower .,1
"we timed our trip so we could view paris during daylight , sunset and then darkness with the first light show starting at 6.00 pm , truly amazing .",1
we had the option to go to the summit for about 12 euros more but if you have a problem with heights the 2 floor was good enough for us .,1
give it a freshen up dear mayor of paris !!,1
"however , we took the stairs to the second floor and there was virtually nobody else about .",1
much to our delight we could purchase another ticket on the evening and go up to the top .,1
what is a trip to paris without a visit to this world icon ?,1
made the already beautiful night more memorable !,1
we did all the way to the top .,1
for the eiffel tower part of the trip you got to skip the lines and proceed up to the restaurant on the first level where you were served lunch .,1
we bought skip the line tickets on line which was well worth it to avoid the queues .,1
"yes it is a tourist thing to do , but you ca n't come to paris and not go to the eiffel tower !",1
of course paris is wonderful so why would n't the eiffel tower .,1
i tried to purchase tickets for the eiffel tower well in advance -lrb- about 4-5 months -rrb- with no luck .,1
"i had heard from people that the eiffel tower was not as big or neat as you would like , i found it to be the exact opposite .",1
never miss paris ' famous landmark !,1
the whole paris city looks just breathtakingly beautiful .,1
"like any other old movies , this is portrayed as the romantic place to be in .",1
i was impressed though with the price charged of 5 euros for an adult and 4 for a youth to go up to level 2 which i thought was good value for a major tourist attraction .,1
expensive but worth it as a one off !,1
we went to the 2nd level .,1
"for what was designed as a temporary structure for the world fair , this is now one of the most iconic landmarks of our time .",1
for such a popular attraction there has to be a better system !!,1
it 's is an amazing structure but way to many people .,1
you ca n't really see anything up close anyway .,1
huge queued in the morning .,1
when you go on top of it you will see the whole splendour of paris !!!,1
you get pestered here by hawkers so i 'm glad we did n't hang around too long .,1
one can certainly say it is easy to find ...,1
i hear it is much better at night .,1
go see it on a sunny day when the foundations are on .,1
"no problem , you can buy your tickets to the top on the second floor , not queue at all .",1
i visited the tour eiffel and i liked the view !!,1
"we had a tour guide to show us around the inside of the tower and give us the history and stats , which was so interesting .",1
"-lrb- i would n't bother going up , the best views of paris are those with the eiffel in it -rrb- .",1
we waited longer to get down because so many more people had come .,1
a must see as it 's probably the most famous sight in paris .,1
then we came back at night .,1
the views were unbelievable and we even saw a storm traveling over the city .,1
"we had direct access after passing security -lrb- no queuing -rrb- , to all three floors and were lucky to see the sights of paris during daylight , dusk and evening - perfect !",1
the lack of signs and efficiency was staggering .,1
better book elevator to the top .,1
went at night .,1
few words can do justice to this masterpiece .,1
it was my favorite past time .,1
do bring layers as it can be way cooler at the top than at the bottom .,1
symbol of paris ... nice ... its great at the day but even better at night .,1
its really huge ... be amazed !!,1
enough things been said and i doubt i can add anything that was not written before .,1
could not recommend this highly enough .,1
we were there in the evening and it was spectacular .,1
"and even though paris is so much more , and offers everyone something spectacular it truly stays amazing to visit this monument .",1
"its obvious from the outset that you 'll wait in queues but on climbing the stairs to the second floor , i then got into a queue for what i thought was the elevator taking me up , only to find my ticket did n't cover that .",1
totally ok to wait the line that was there .,1
i wo n't review this much because it is the eiffel tower ... a monument for a wonderful city and beautiful country .,1
a must see emblem of french pride and engineering .,1
the icon of the city .,1
you forget about the long cues when you reach the viewing platforms .,1
definitely a place worth visiting .,1
entry is only at specific time but no time limit to exit .,1
i 've seen the photos of the eiffel tower many many times but they never done it justice .,1
it is one of the best attraction i have seen and i will suggest to go rich the top of it .,1
"at about 10:00 pm most evenings in the summer , it will light up and dazzle and sparkle .",1
and there were tasty snacks at the top to refuel so ca n't complain .,1
i stayed away from crowds and always kept a quick exit in mind .,1
i had an amazing time walking up the stairs to the 1st and then 2nd floor .,1
long queue to get the tickets,1
had nice ice cream & very refreshing lemon slushy whilst sitting & taking in the view .,1
"worth the crowds , we took a guided tour , so we could skip the lines and we were able to go to the top !",1
must be seen in the dark .,1
"if you are brave and energetic enough , you can climb hundreds of stairs .",1
we were never rushed -lrb- we spent 1-1/2 hr in the restaurant !,1
"a large fence keeps visitors from walking around it , and there are aggressive street vendors everywhere .",1
a site not to be missed .,1
totally different view each time .,1
we did a skip the line with viator .,1
we found the entrance nearest the park the best -lrb- no line through security -rrb- for those with reservations .,1
"everyone talks about the paris lights and paris is beautiful at night , at 11 pm something magical happens .",1
"i noticed that in the morning is terrible busy and when i went in the afternoon was much better , still busy but the line was faster .",1
i waited and waited and finally got down .,1
in our opinion it will be look better at night with dark surroundings and the light are lighted up .,1
so we were able to go all the way to the top -lrb- in about 4.5 hours ! -rrb-,1
good in the day time but best during and after sunset .,1
"at night , in the day , twinkling , or not lit at all ... most certainly a must see while visiting paris !",1
a ticket for an 18 year old was 5 euros to the second level walking .,1
the views are amazing the crowds are always a bit overwhelming .,1
i first visited the eiffel tower many years ago and was n't planning to go to the top again on this trip .,1
just under the tower you can find cash machine if you need .,1
spend the extra euros and go to the higher floors .,1
lines could get very long and they also have security checks for bags which can take some time .,1
there is a restaurant for drinks and food and bathrooms .,1
atmosphere was nice !,1
"on our trip with the whole family , we waited for the midnight hour .",1
we went in the evening and stayed to see the tower lit in all its glory .,1
"it was good , but not as good as i expected .",1
"we pre booked tickets online via trip advisor for a tour of all the landmarks , boat trip on the seine and up the tower .",1
there are close to 700 steps till the 2nd floor and the view from the top is breathe taking .,1
"an excellent day for those with a keen eye for photography , from the ground all the way to the top ; amazing views .",1
"i just did n't like the fact the stairs close at 18:30 and beyond that you need to take the elevator , but only until 21:30 .",1
highly recommend getting a tour guide to at least bypass the very long first line to general public and have access to the group tour line .,1
"it took only 2 years and 2 months with 300 workers , 18,038 pieces of wrought iron and 2.5 million rivets to build the eiffel tower .",1
however we bought discounted tickets on paris attractions prior to our trip .,1
"that is , unless you can afford the jules verne ... in which case you are probably not looking on trip advisor for your vacation plans !",1
"we did not buy tickets to the top , the views from the 2nd level were lovely and the line for that lift were huge and we had too much paris left to see .",1
it is amazing and you can appreciate why the people of paris would not let it be taken out after the exhibition it is the centre point of paris,1
it is an enchanting experience .,1
"the lady of paris always amuses me , no matter how many times i visit .",1
lol amazingly romantic .,1
we visited the eiffel tower at night and lucky us there was no queue !!!,1
"it was so gorgeous , especially at night when it was lit up in the belgium flag .",1
most people come to paris solely to see the tower .,1
we took the metro 4 and changed onto metro 6 from gare montparnasse to bir hakeim .,1
keep items in a satchel and you wo n't have any issues,1
absolutely loved seeing the tower lit up and night and the eiffel tower light show was very exciting to see : -rrb-,1
"the weather was rather windy so when we asked to book at 5pm , the top level was closed !",1
"my partner and i visited paris in august and we stayed in a hotel close to the eiffel tower , it was the first thing we wanted to see .",1
we also recommend a trip to see it is close up and naturally have your picture taken like a true ` tourist ' :-rrb-,1
"the line up was quite long to go up and i knew i would be seeing paris from other venues , so just walking around the base of the tower and seeing it from virtually everywhere we went was enough for us .",1
i was in paris over new years and visited the eiffel tower .,1
visit to top is a must to get the amazing view of paris from all sides .,1
we did not climb the tower due to the crowds and the wind but merely being in the presence of the structure was enough for us .,1
do n't take large bags !,1
"i can still say that i have been to the eiffel tower , but i would have liked to enjoy the whole experience !",1
it 's such a world renowned place and so awesome it really speaks for itself .,1
it ended up being a beautiful day and we had to make a huge line .,1
i asked my long time girlfriend to marry me under the eiffle tower,1
"we headed up on the stairs option up to the second viewing deck where we then caught the lift , certainly recommend this as you get more unspoilt views !",1
it 's just a bit pity that i didnt manage to go up to the tower due to security measures .,1
we had it on our short list of must see places and stopped by on the day we arrived .,1
advance tickets recommended .,1
even though you are in paris for 8 hours or more .,1
it 's what you go to paris to see !,1
really worth the effort .,1
"eiffel tower no. 1 on paris my advice to get you ticket on early before 1 or 2 month before your visit better than take 4 hours to get a ticket and lose one day the best time to visit in the sun set time it is amazing time you can see all paris from the top , also try to visit the 3 floor and if you are rich get lunc or dinner there",1
i recommend to do it during the day if you really want see the whole of paris .,1
it is the most recognizable structure in the world that you associate with a city .,1
"bit more scary than expected.good price , $ 17 to the top -lrb- plenty of places charge a lot more -rrb- .",1
if not you might end up waiting 3-4 hours in a queue .,1
"first off , if you want to go to the top , prepare for a 1-2 hour wait to clear security .",1
the one attraction i wanted to make sure we did with the kids and it did n't disappoint - really enjoyed it !,1
do n't go alone .,1
"one of the things to tick off on any paris visit , but overall quite an average experience .",1
"though , i bought few for myself as well : - -rrb-",1
the only drawback is that access is difficult in the peak tourist season .,1
save yourself a few euros and a 3 hour wait and walk up !,1
"i 've visited the eiffel tower in april , july and november.i 've enjoyed the experience each time.it 's wonderful to be there when the lights go on at night , it was a fantastic experience to see the fireworks july 14th and in november a hot chocolate purchased at the top of the tower was a welcome treat !",1
"it was pretty strenuous to walk so if you have any health problems or a lower fitness level , either take it slow or think about getting the lift if possible .",1
"well worth the effort and yes there can be long queues , this time we bought ` skip the line ' tickets which are well worth it and does save you waiting so long on the ground .",1
"there are also a lot of people trying to sell you little towers , crappy selfie sticks and the best of all the guys from africa that grab your hand and make you a bracelet out of embroidery floss and then demand 20 euros ha ha .",1
definitely cold up there .,1
buy your tickets online before you go - lines are crazy .,1
it 's like a live show !,1
proof of work disability will will merit special pricing,1
"we went up the north leg and waited 2 hours and just as we got to the ticket office , they closed the top level due to overcrowding so could only buy an 11 eur ticket to level 2 .",1
like most places in paris it can be busy and crowded and you have to queue through security bag checks .,1
take the elevator up and walk down for the experience,1
"buy your tickets to the third level way in advance because we had to get them through an agency , as they were all gobbled up by tour groups reselling them ... buy early !!!",1
"on the second level you 'll find restaurants -lrb- you 'll need a reservation -rrb- , cafés and shops .",1
this should be the first stop for anyone traveling to paris .,1
"anyway , going down was a challenge , since lifts were full on 1st floor and had to wait long time ...",1
loved the tower and its views,1
lots of stairs to climb to get to the 1st & 2nd level .,1
always noce as well to discuss with visitors always happy to be here,1
everyone should really go and visit .,1
"we came back on monday around 8 pm and the lines were much less , we waited for 10 mins max .",1
seeing it for the first time at night was breath taking .,1
so the next ticket office staff was also insisting that he should pay a child price .,1
"book tickets before so you can join the que for the lifts up , rather join another que just for tickets .",1
first dream would like to go this place now i was there is very nice and amazing in paris i spend 2 hours there .,1
going in the lifts was a bit scary as they seem to squash a lot of people in but once you reach the top it 's a wonderful view,1
what a delight to get to stand below one of the worlds most iconic structures went on a bright december day and was amazed by its presence it does n't look that tall from a distance however close up it is amazing watch out for the lights at night they twinkle on the hour every hour for five minutes a nice feature .,1
the weather was super cold up there `` december '' but also it was awesome .,1
we used staircase going down .,1
you can buy refreshments inside .,1
if you have kids under 10 cross the river for a playground that offers excellent views of the tower and photo opportunities .,1
"this was a very beautiful view , unfortunately it 's a big tourist attraction , which also attracts street sellers .",1
"biggest tip i could give anyone is to take the elevator up to the second level , enjoy your time up there but avoid the elevator going down , walking down one of the legs is an awesome experience .",1
you can stop off on the first floor and second floor for lunch/tea/dinner depending on you appetite and your budget .,1
wander across the road or alight at metro trocadero for wonderful portrait views of this wonderful spectacle .,1
the observation areas are all outside and it was extremely windy .,1
visited this icon 10 years ago and went up to the top .,1
"also , watch out for pickpockets !",1
security keeps all the novelty pettlers and will you sign my petition scammers on the outside so you can better enjoy the visit .,1
"whenever im in paris , la tour eiffel is a must for me to visit otherwise it does n't feel like ive been to paris",1
that awesome .,1
the shopping and food is to die for .,1
"last visit was 2 years ago , and every time we feel the wow factor !",1
we arrived at about 10.30 am and there was n't really a queue .,1
maybe next time i will hike up them !,1
it really is a beauty in the sky .,1
it is easy to book this ticket in advance and print it on line .,1
we queued for about 20 minutes to get our tickets and bought summit access .,1
just tired of saying no all the time !,1
at the top you could see so much more of paris .,1
"during the day you can sit in the park and look up at it , take pictures etc. .",1
ideally set off in the morning at the start of the open .,1
later we did the river cruise and saw it all in lights !,1
"over priced , but then i think the entire country is over priced .",1
the views are wonderful ... .,1
so save your cash !,1
in sorry for the vendors but thrilled for hubby and me !,1
"because paris is so low rise , the views from the top are truly extraordinary .",1
great for professional photographers .,1
"look , i know everyone wants to see this icon , and most do when they come here .",1
an easy elevator ride -lrb- actually there are two rides -rrb- get you to an observation deck that offers views that will drown your fear of heights .,1
lifts were out of order so we did stairs to level 2 .,1
you also miss the hawkers selling dreadful little plastic towers at the base .,1
"spectacular view of course , but that feeling i can not describe .",1
a must destination for a first time visit to paris .,1
"also the amount of ladies pestering you to sign there homemade survey , just say no and move on , we were warned they are part of a pick pocket gang so watch your belongings .",1
went back to the eiffel tower as its a must do thing in paris .,1
"area around eiffel tower was under construction and unsightly , leaving promenades leading to the tower more crowded and jammed with hawkers of eiffel tower trinkets .",1
do take note that the observation deck on top is partially outdoor .,1
loved every minute !,1
because of security measures the garden surrounding the tower is surrounded by an ugly makeshift fence .,1
i strongly recommend to take the stairs up and not to use the elevator .,1
this site is not good for disability or dealing with excessively hot weather .,1
download the visitor guide to your phone for a tour and interesting background stories .,1
"remember , though , you can not take liquids up !",1
"we had n't pre booked tickets so we arrived early , security was quick and efficient .",1
visiting the eiffel tower is something that you have to do !,1
get your tickets online so you do not have to wait in line .,1
marveled at the history of the structure and the craftsmanship .,1
we have fantasized about eating an eclair on the eiffel .,1
"even though we did not have table right next to the window , there is an excellent view from any table in the restaurant .",1
otherwise be prepared for long lines and street urchins .,1
"if you 're thinking , `` should i make the trip over ? ''",1
a site not to be missed when going to paris .,1
obviously a must see if you 're visiting paris .,1
so many people pushing to get selfies and blocking everyone else from getting to the windows to see .,1
the second tier is a bit nerve wracking now that i 'm getting on but those views are still worth it .,1
"it was a misty day so view was not great , but it 's more about the experience of going to the top rather than what you see when you get there .",1
"of note , the official website never stated that they were closing the top for weather reasons - this would have been appreciated .",1
thousands of people come to see the eiffel tower and a lot of them pay to take the motorized ride way up into the tower .,1
"we fall asleep and wake up from our close by apartment with a full view of her iconic style with evening lights and blinding led shimmering for five minutes at ten , eleven and midnight .",1
it was in september 2015 but for my is like yesterday .,1
"we got a view of the city during a day light , evening and a night .",1
platforms are big and solid .,1
our hotel sent us to a restaurant that had an excellent view of the tower .,1
take the tour to 2nd floor or ride to the top and celebrate with a glass of champagne .,1
"well , except our dear asian tourists , who seem to be buying anything you put in front of them .",1
pre booked for 10pm great views at night .,1
we went up till the summit and took lots of pictures there .,1
"that familiarity caused the visit to be somewhat underwhelming , but it was still worth the trip up to the 2nd level .",1
very busy but always recommended .,1
"i dont know about peak tourist season , but in the fisrt week of april , around 4 pm , the queue was hardly ten minutes long , and we could go up to the second floor without any fuss , unlike what most posters imply .",1
i paid for a skip the line tour through viator .,1
especially the highest part of the tower is super crowded .,1
we stood right under it with armed guards all around .,1
we were very lucky in that the queues were not long and the weather was wonderful .,1
the view from mid level and the top are great .,1
"i have visited paris few times but it is only in last september -lrb- 2015 -rrb- , i had night views .",1
must see it during the day & a definite must at night !,1
the tower is the focus here and it is truly special .,1
"me and my partner recently came to paris , and we went up the eiffel tower and the views are amazing from the top .",1
it 's advisable to go later like 8 or 9pm to skip the waiting & crowds .,1
the food at the restaurant in the first level was delicious .,1
all at one place .,1
a must stop .,1
the eiffel tower is a given so i wo n't say much other than go at night !,1
you can go up by stairs or take the elevator .,1
that was the best !,1
"adults tickets are 17euros , children 8,5 and free for under 4 years but you must have an id for the child to prove the age !",1
"really beautiful , and was definitely the highlight of our trip !",1
then i switched to the elevator for the top .,1
"the day that i visited , there were limited to no queues and quite memorable getting to the 2nd floor .",1
visited briefly on ny eve to see it lit up .,1
perhaps .,1
going up to the top is breathtaking .,1
do not accept flowers from anyone unless you are willing to pay for it as they place it in your hand pretending it 's a gift then aggressively ask for money !,1
is nice and so good .,1
even though i went there just after what happened on 13th november ... i still enjoy the view that the tower provides me .,1
"each level is a must see , especially the summit .",1
came here a week after the terror attacks .,1
it is everything one imagines and more .,1
"it stops at the first level and you can take a look at a nice view , the up to the last floor , where you have fences anti suicides .",1
queued for an hour .,1
see the tower at night for its light show as well .,1
we visited the eiffel tower early evening .,1
this well known landmark was even better than expected .,1
reached the eiffel tower just before 9pm and that 's when the sparkling lights went off .,1
would definitely recommend !,1
the eiffel tower is just a structure but it is an amazing one to see .,1
"a really nice and wonderful , it is important to get to the top and raul the stunning scenery of paris .",1
our visit was enhanced by the international music groups that performed with the tower in the background .,1
book your `` skip the line '' tickets before you leave to avoid a possible 3 hour wait .,1
we did the skip the line for 3 levels and it was worth it .,1
7 $ each to get to the second floor by elevator and 6.50 $ each to go up to the summit if you want to .,1
it will be a perfect evening with your loved ones .,1
the top most attraction in the city of romance .,1
watch out for pick pockets .,1
our only downside was the crowds which is probably a daily expectation .,1
as it happened on the day it was pouring with rain so the queues were not that long .,1
i visited the eiffel tower in may there was such a ling cue and loads of people trying to sell stuff not a good experience !!!,1
"yes , it is a cliche .",1
on this level is the restaurant and you have your first opportunity to view paris .,1
which is amazing !!,1
the views are absolutely fantastic and the small room in 3rd floor is so cool .,1
we opted for a window seat which i do not believe was worth it .,1
such a beautifully amazing structure .,1
"6780 coral way , miami fl 33155 course that recommended and necessary .",1
the light show happens on the hour and my son was excited to see the twinkling lights .,1
we had a beautiful night .,1
"as long as you do n't mind thousands of people queued to go inside , you will be fine .",1
"the pricing seems pretty reasonable , and there are now also 2 stages of security bag checks which is great .",1
defo something to see .,1
wandered around the parks which is very pleasant .,1
got to visit this place if you are in paris .,1
a new life long memory was made !,1
do not be put off tho .,1
its beautiful / nice / romantic etc ... but i rather the view at night -lrb- less pollution and most def less people around trying to sell you selfie stick -rrb- lol ...,1
the eiffel tower is absolutely amazing !!!,1
beautiful and impressive .,1
amazing view over the city .,1
we highly recommend !,1
"also you have to go through security if you want to use the toilets near the eiffel tower , they are in the secured area .",1
loved my first sight of the eiffel tower it was so special as my husband was with me and he proposed to me again just because we were so loved up,1
and some day the tower may hid behind the fog .,1
"well organised , especially if you pre book your tickets and get fast tracked .",1
and then walked along the seine .,1
"the queue takes almost an hour , so calculate that .",1
"we walk up to the eiffel tower , which is really worthy .",1
"i 've been to paris twice , solo .",1
definitely a must at least once in your lifetime .,1
this will take you to a major road junction -lrb- featuring avenue rapp -rrb- .,1
"if you have a chance , you may want to watch the sunset from the summit and stick around for the light show .",1
very organised .,1
when in paree this is a must do !!,1
great stop on a sunny clear day .,1
"my wife and i have been here a couple times now , but this was the first time we went up .",1
it 's like it 's made of solid gold rather than rusting steel .,1
during my visit i met group of rude visitors skipping the line so my overall experience is terrible and i am definitely not coming back .,1
"one must go - but beware of the cons roaming the area , and try to see at night , much more romantic when lit up .",1
"even if you only go to level one and have coffee , you will experience something unique in the world .",1
we went to the top and enjoyed the panoramic view of the city from the top .,1
ok ... a must see in paris for sure .,1
this line was about 30 minutes long and cost 7 $ .,1
only 5 euro to go to the second floor .,1
"i never know there was a garden bar , and cafe .",1
in order to go up it there is a huge wait .,1
views and photo ops are remarkable !,1
and there is a nice place in the first floor to relax with your family ... do n't miss that part,1
"eiffel tower located in champ de mars in paris , france is not only the city 's top attraction but also the top attraction of the world .",1
a set menu of sensational culinary experiences .,1
did not get to go up the tower due to short visit and booked up .,1
the views were beautiful and food was delicious .,1
"worth stopping by , not my favorite place in paris but the restaurant is nice .",1
we took many many many pictures .,1
the effects are magnificent !,1
you should visit the tower .,1
you can still walk up and get tickets !,1
queues are ridiculous and as many people walk away as go up .,1
everyone knows eiffel,1
this was the quickest line .,1
"unless you intend having a meal at one of the restaurants or to have a look in the very small and crowded souvenir shop -lrb- s -rrb- , there is not much else to do .",1
"the only caveat is the summit -lrb- the very top level -rrb- closes at 11pm , so we could n't see that , but from level 2 , you can see all of paris illuminated with life and love .",1
"be sure to reserve ahead ... i mean really ahead , as in months before you visit -- especially if that visit will be in the months of june-august .",1
the area around it is also nice to spend time in .,1
"we pre booked tickets online from the official website , its worth knowing that there is such a thing as ticket touts offer tickets at double the official price .",1
it is one of those icons that you see your entire life and it is great to see it in person .,1
great views of paris from all angles from here .,1
it 's a cheap attraction and it kills some time .,1
"built in 1889 and designed by the young engineer gustave eiffel , the tower stands at 324 metres tall .",1
"we went first thing in the morning for 9:30 opening , which also helps .",1
"after all , it is just a tower .",1
"really , eiffel tower may as well be the most visited place in paris but it is worth the visit , it totally looks much bigger in reality + you can get souvenirs from vendors there for cheap prices , way cheaper than shops .",1
buy your tickets at the eiffel tower .,1
"all these people are fraud , try to avoid them as much as possible .",1
our most recent visit we bought tickets to the summit -lrb- third floor/top of the eifel tower -rrb- .,1
"just get over the queues , take a book , take a sandwich , take a friend .",1
and they are going as fast as they can at the ticket offices - it 's not inefficiency but just an over popular monument .,1
we used the viatour jump the line tickets and they were extremely useful .,1
it was quite expensive but the views are breath taking .,1
"or , walk around to find that perfect angle for a great photo .",1
"when we first viewed it from our river boat , it was aglow with the colors of the belgium flag in reverence to the very recent terrorist attacks in brussels .",1
even if you do n't it is pretty spectacular .,1
the awe that comes from being around the eiffel tower is amazing .,1
take the 3rd floor ticket for the real view .,1
"and the view on the 2nd level is something to behold.also , you know it does n't hurt to have that been there done that photo : -rrb-",1
had lunch in the cafe which was nice .,1
just keep walking if you 're not interested .,1
pictures do not do this justice .,1
"you ca n't go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower , also called la dame de fer or the iron lady .",1
fantastic sight to see awestruck when standing underneath it it really is awesome its just amazing .,1
"walked up , looked around , took a selfie or ten .",1
could n't visit paris without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
you can see everything from the new frank gehry building to the west to sacre coeur and the pompideau and maybe even your hotel .,1
"i hate heights , however , the fact that the tower wraps around the lift lessened the fear .",1
it 's even better than i 'd imagined .,1
only 17 euros for a ticket to the top with a wonderful view .,1
it 's a must see attraction and you really need to go to the top .,1
book ahead to avoid long lines .,1
"if you 've never been , your visit would be incomplete without a trip up !",1
4 of us all had the experience menu .,1
loved the place ... : -rrb-,1
one of those things in the world that lives up to all of the hype .,1
we were up on the 2nd level observation deck before the 11pm light show .,1
i went to paris ten years ago and when we got to the summit of the tower it started to rain and it was so cloudy that i could n't see anything .,1
took my breath away to see it !!!!!,1
"you wo n't avoid all of the lines -lrb- it 's a huge attraction , after all -rrb- - but you will cut your wait time in half .",1
"even if you do not go up to the top , you can still find numerous great views of this monument throughout the city .",1
lineups are impossible the landmark for paris .,1
get there early and you will probably have a relatively short wait .,1
it 's a little scary to think you 're going to the top of a 130 + year old 240 + meter iron structure but it seems very solidly built and maintained .,1
an amazing piece of engineering to say the least .,1
go later in the evening -lrb- 8pm -rrb- and avoid the queues especially if you are happy to walk up which is a good way of using up excess energy of boys .,1
walking up to the second floor is possible but it is 686 steps -lrb- you do n't want to be sore for your stay in paris :--rrb- -rrb- the views are breathtaking from all levels and it is fun to stand on the transparent glass -lrb- albeit a little scary -rrb- the eiffel tower is the most recognized structure around the world .,1
try the macaroons from the 2nd floor viewing deck .,1
"the down side of this attraction can be the huge lines you have to make to purchase your tickets , go through security and then to enter the elevator/s .",1
we heard so much about the tickets that we pre brought our tickets online .,1
"huge construction , massive structure - really one of the man made wonders !!!!",1
there is a magical in looking up from the base of the tower at night as the lights twinkle and hundreds of people star in awe .,1
it is stunning at night also as it is lit up .,1
this has been on my bucket list all of my life and i finally was able to do it !,1
"it was practically a free-for-all , and unfortunately , on most days at least a 2-3 hour wait !",1
the view from atop of the eiffel tower was spectacular .,1
"magnificent , but more spectacular when you take the evening cruise down the sienne .",1
"having said that , if you visit paris you are obliged to go see it but i would suggest just just book a few hours and get it over with .",1
do n't waste a complete day on this `` meh '' attraction .,1
"i made the mistake of not doing that , but if you make the same mistake do what we did and be there around closing time , the lines completely die down and you can be one of the last people up .",1
since then more than 250 million people visited the eiffel tower .,1
wasnt that hot either beginning of august !,1
it 's a true marvel of design and machinery .,1
selfies are priceless there !,1
it 's a must see at night and during the day for the view over the city .,1
at 10pm the tower sparkles for 5 minutes with hundreds of white lights .,1
"she gave us the history but most importantly , she got us right in .",1
try to get the tickets booked online before hand as the crowd is crazy .,1
"huge , istake on our part that we didnt pre book so be warned to do so .",1
"better still , if you can , i would highly recommend dining in one of the restaurants housed within the tower itself !!",1
do n't miss a chance to go to the top of eiffel tower at 15.50 euro .,1
"if you are visiting paris , you absolutely have to visit the eiffel tower !",1
"you do also queue again on the way down and feel very tired by the end of it , saying that everything v was so beautiful so it was worth it .",1
it is simple stunning .,1
its like millions of leds starts blinking .,1
its a must ☺ .,1
loved this place very much,1
"ari was on time , professional and very patient with my wife requests .",1
it was stunning !,1
go to top !,1
this is a must do when in paris .,1
the view is awesome and unforgettable .,1
she was excellent very informative and well spoken .,1
the views were amazing but it was fairly foggy so you could n't get the full affect so i 'd recommend going on a clear day !,1
"ca n't really express how magnificent this monument is , especially for those visiting for the first time .",1
"taking a ride up to the top on a chilly day is n't something i 'd recommend , and you can get a panoramic view of paris from the pompidou centre and many other places .",1
staff was on strike for 1 week .,1
i do n't care how many times i visit paris ... having a picnic with champagne in front of the eiffel tower will always be on my itinerary .,1
walk around and view its massive size .,1
if you choose to buy a ticket to the top can do so from the second floor .,1
not much queuing .,1
bit of a queue but worth the wait and the money .,1
view was so gorgeous from up top .,1
you will need to take two different elevators to reach the top but once you are there it will soooo worth it .,1
paid 17 euros each adult and made our way to the top .,1
"the views are much better from the montparnasse tower -lrb- tour de montparnasse -rrb- but if you have never been to paris , you should simply join the crowds .",1
it could be a left over scaffold left to fester .,1
there is a waxwork image of a meeting-taking place with thomas edison and gustav eiffel .,1
what a work of art and technology .,1
definitely worth the visit !,1
"it is definetely the tourist place but after you pass all the queues , you can find up on the second and third floor a place where you find your own peace and quiet place .",1
be ready to see a few couples getting engaged at night !,1
while they had security it did not feel professional .,1
plan on waiting in line .,1
but the view was spectacular and the city looked amazing from the height .,1
we stopped here quickly on a bus tour and since we did not want to go up the tower it was fine .,1
anyway the walk to the tower is just great .,1
steps wide and with regular landings to catch your breath its not an ordeal .,1
i also saw for the first time the statue of liberty in paris .,1
"unfortunately , due to recent terrorist activity in paris , the security everywhere is getting tighter .",1
"when i first saw it , i wanted to cry - it was that beautiful .",1
"surrounding area is very nice , and the view of the tower is a once in a lifetime .",1
"it 's a very impressive piece of architecture , but all the awe people usually feel when they see it and stroll underneath it is not present in my case .",1
it is ridiculous you have to wait again when you want to go down .,1
if you are fit and able take the stairs .,1
we visited during the day and evening and both views did n't disappoint .,1
"there are security checks on the way in before you get your tickets and i found these security officers polite , friendly and helpful -lrb- the gentleman who searched my bag was great fun and gave me some good advice on my personal safety -rrb- .",1
"the eiffel tower is neat to see , especially at night , but now worth the long wait to get to the top .",1
"the wonderful lawns & gardens facing the structure are equally well maintained , however the open area around the structure unfortunately is not .",1
did n't wait long for the lift to go to the second floor or the one to the summit .,1
supposedly one of the most romantic places on earth .,1
you get a 360 degree view from all the levels .,1
"we walked down the stairs from level 2 to 1 , level 1 is a bigger viewing platform with interesting information on the tower and a restaurant .",1
plan ahead and come .,1
you have the option of climbing up to the second floor then getting a lift to the top and do the cruise at some other time .,1
so pack some patience and enjoy the view !,1
i will tell you that if you are handicapped -lrb- like using a cane to steady yourself -rrb- you can not go up to the very top ~ you can go part way up .,1
it was a gorgeous brisk day and the sun was out .,1
and our friends from usa need to know that eiffel himself worked on the statue of liberty .,1
we walked to the eiffel tower from our hotel to see the lights .,1
went there at night with my contiki group and was fast tracked via the group entrance .,1
this was a must see in paris !!,1
"well where do i start , me and my mum recently visited paris and had to go up the eiffel tower of course !",1
avoid visiting on weekends as this place is fully cramped up .,1
"great view , very nice lunch at restaurant .",1
we did the green bus tour .,1
an icon in the world .,1
the lines to walk up the stairs are always a lot shorter .,1
there was hardly any que .,1
you can walk up one of the legs of the tower to the first level or you can get the cable cars all the way to the top,1
see it lit up at night as it is so beautiful and just think it was built in the late 1800s for an exhibition but never taken down afterwards .,1
with this visit i can say `` check '',1
the `` picnic '' was served in sweet little dishes and was surprisingly delicious .,1
we had a 15mth old but this was no real obstacle .,1
visiting paris and skipping eiffel tower would be criminal .,1
"paris lit up at night , then the eiffel sparkles every hour for a couple minutes , and it was wonderful !!",1
"even if we were all to write the worst things about it , people would still go and see it .",1
"after about 20 minutes in line for the elevator , we made it to the top for stunning views .",1
we were so thrilled to finally see this iconic tower .,1
the location is also perfect .,1
if you are going to paris you need to visit the eiffel tower .,1
"the icon of paris , the symbol of liberty ~ ~",1
it 's only 7 $ to walk up .,1
go to paris and not go up the tower that is a nono .,1
"instead of going to the summit , we only went to the second floor which is about 125 meters above ground .",1
it was very cold but it was worthy .,1
we had a clear cloudless blue sky day with views of all of paris and beyond .,1
might be worthwhile getting a few tips on how to get the best from your camera in low light .,1
it was much larger than i imagined .,1
it 's beautiful during the day time and night for sure with many reasons .,1
"it is always better to buy the ticket on line , then you can avoid long waiting time to buy the ticket.it was really organised !",1
"this magnificent steel tower , tallest in europe , is an icon of paris , as well as of france itself .",1
this is a must to visit ... and climb too .,1
"we arrived fifteen minutes early but were granted admission with no issues , and skipped a huge line which was for those who had n't pre booked !",1
and the view ... well enough said !!,1
must see for paris .,1
fabulously scary !,1
"like i said , it 's the eiffel tower , paris 's landmark and one of the most iconic monuments in the world .",1
can not beat it !,1
there are vendors with souvenirs and drinks .,1
one can only appreciate it from either the architecture build of the soul of it .,1
it is luck that my husband suggest that we go in the morning .,1
as is seeing the eiffel tower all lit up and sparkly at night .,1
there are many young men hovering around the site with trinkets for sale .,1
we did n't feel the need to go to the top of eiffel tower as views of paris can be seen from other vantage points free of charge.nothing could prefer me for the height of it but viewing the tower at night was the highlight .,1
the lines here can be nuts .,1
"jam packed with tourists , long lines to go up , seedy characters selling junk , but you need to be there anyway if it 's your first time .",1
we walked around outside .,1
we kept checking back for tickets online and were lucky enough to get them .,1
excellent views all round at the top and also on the second level and the first level where the restuarant is .,1
"i kept a money belt under my clothes , a very sturdy cross body bag with the zipper under my hand or/and under my jacket .",1
the line-ups are long so be there early .,1
"impressive by the seine , but very crowded , long lines to go up .",1
the best view is of course from palais de chaillot .,1
"if you are unable , do n't miss your time by doing long lines to buy a ticket instead visit other monuments .",1
the only benefit of going up is to see paris from another angle .,1
we had not pre-booked ` skip the line ' tickets as we had so much on and were not sure when we were visiting the tower but i would strongly recommend a tour or these pre-booked tickets to save you time,1
"otherwise , just look at the really tall thing .",1
level one houses t he famous jules verne restaurant or serves as a transfer point to elevators to levels two and three .,1
"the cues to get in the tower were unbelievable , without our pre booked tickets we 'd have cued all day .",1
we decided not to go up due to the huge numbers and a hot august day getting the better of us .,1
it 's 1 million times better to see in person than tv or magazine .,1
it was great to be visiting the tower .,1
the pick-pockets must have been taking a break because we had absolutely no problem viewing the beautiful paris sky line at night !,1
if there is only 1 thing you do in paris .,1
"do n't do this on your own , you will be waiting forever on lines .",1
"beautifully lit at night , fun eat in the little park beside it .",1
i definitely would recommend getting tickets on line ... it was a beautiful day when we went and the line looked like it was about 2 hours long !,1
spent the afternoon climbing after having a so-so tourist lunch on the first floor .,1
"we took advice from fellow travelers and visited le tour at night , when the lines were much shorter .",1
this truly is a `` must-do '' .,1
its a must see .,1
very cheap and very worth it .,1
symbol of paris that is not to be missed .,1
strongly recommend to do an upfront reservation to limit the waiting period .,1
all i imagined a trip to the effiel tower would be .,1
truely a wonder !!,1
just wow !!,1
"it 's easily booked in advance online , you skip the line , you have a guided tour of the engineering and history of this beautiful marvel !",1
seeing it in person and soaking in the atmosphere is so much better than pictures or videos .,1
oh and some champs .,1
we arranged our timings to be at the top for sunset and it was amazing .,1
we went anyway to see it up close and found you can go and join a queue to get tickets to go up either in the lift or walking up the stairs .,1
does n't need a hard sell .,1
"taking a metro that evening allowed us to discover the iconic tower for ourselves , which is the way to go .",1
beautiful at night time particularly when sparkling/lit up on the hour !,1
such an iconic place to visit that i hope my daughter will remember in years to come .,1
i think the security could have moved a bit faster .,1
through a mixup our `` skip the line '' tickets did not work out .,1
she beckons each of us to come visit her and never fails to impress .,1
the eiffel tower is the place must to go in paris .,1
if you do it fast it can take around 1.5 hours to go to summit and get back .,1
views of paris were awesum .,1
we walked up the tower to the first level which was easy and presented a great view .,1
the lights in the evening are beautiful .,1
it did seem to be more crowded as the day progressed .,1
if you want to go to the top level from there you can buy an extra ticket but only by lift .,1
on my next trip i would love to go up at night .,1
we bought tickets online so did n't have to wait long .,1
"the trip up the eiffel tower was a highlight of our visit to paris , the views from the top are incredible and more than worth the queuing .",1
as it was still around 30 degrees this option was n't appealing .,1
prebuy your tickets to avoid queues .,1
we were there in late july ; arrived before 10 and waited maybe 15 minutes to but tickets .,1
you wont regret it !,1
it ´ s good exercise and gives you time to reflect over this fantastic construction !,1
we arrived on the opposite side of the river having come from the arc de triomphe .,1
splurge on a glass of bubbly at the top !,1
only thing funny or odd is the unlicensed sellers selling all the tat .,1
it was bigger than i imagined .,1
we were able to see things that we did not have time to go too .,1
make the most of it and visit all levels,1
we visited multiple times during our 5 day stay in paris .,1
if in paris you need to do this visit !,1
"it was more wonderful , the light show at night was the best scenes of paris .",1
"because of the heightened security , the queues took longer than normal apparently , about 2 hours in total , but this was the middle of the day , and the day before the euro 2016 final - so probably busier than normal .",1
it was a 3rd floor tour and we paid about $ 70each .,1
the eiffel tower is an absolute must see if you are in paris .,1
the second level has just as nice views as the top and a little more space for maneuvering .,1
i never knew there were names surrounding the entire tower of all of the architects that helped with the tower .,1
be very careful if you decide to use this company .,1
"the lineup may be atrocious , but it is definitely worth the wait because once you are up to you can see the whole city .",1
"the lines were long to go up , however , we came back in the evening after 630 and the lines were not bad .",1
beware of algerian kind of people who dupe the tourist with their many cheating skills .,1
"not only is this , imo , the most spectacular perspective , but also you are emerged in a sea of humanity from all four points of the compass with a collective uplifted gaze that lifts the soul .",1
looks like samobody put tower from the sky .,1
built so long ago yet so modern quit the enigma .,1
it is the eiffel tower !,1
i have been coming to the eiffel tower ever since my first visit to paris 50 years ago .,1
it took us about an hour to get up then down .,1
"i really enjoyed seeing this , it was excellent !",1
"there is n't much to say about this iconic attraction , so go see it for yourself !",1
"we went to the ticket counters and got the ticket ourselves , it took us just 40 mins to do the entire thing , to go to the summit and come back .",1
"after a rainy morning , the sun came out and shinned beautifully for a wonderful picture of the eiffel tower .",1
"if you go to paris , you must climb on top of the eiffel tower , as the view is breathtaking .",1
surprisingly we were told by several friends not to visit the eiffel tower on our trip ... so glad we did n't listen to them !,1
as soon as i looked at it i was completely struck .,1
the most fantastic site you will ever see both from the ground and up high .,1
the eiffel is everything it was built up to be .,1
i 've visited the eiffel tower a couple of times .,1
we spent 4 hours in the tower .,1
never miss a chance to go on the top of eiffel tower !,1
it just seems to be -lrb- for us anyway -rrb- one of those places that epitomises a city and travel in general .,1
"lovely in sun or snow , although dull in the grey it is still a must although seeing it sparkle in the evening sky may be just as good as visiting it .",1
"families , couples , solo travelers ... they were all there .",1
there are fantastic views of this structure from all across the city .,1
especially romantic in the early evening when you can see beautiful views transition from daylight to evening when the city of lijghts comes alive .,1
an awe inspiring feat of engineering .,1
it is a few minutes walk from the nearest metro so be prepared .,1
so we know the good stuff .,1
all in all we had a nice time and would go up again .,1
we began going up about 3.30 pm and so were there as the sun began setting which was spectacular .,1
"we enjoyed a paris cafe ' before we left and watched a parked car leave its parking spot -lrb- i say this as the cars are parked bumper to bumper - literally -rrb- and was curious as to how they parked or left when ready to go - well they go forward and backward , forward and backward and in this particular case he could not get out so he backed up to the car behind , then pushed it backward into the next car and the next car until he had enough steering room to leave - wow !",1
looking at the queue it could have been quite a long wait .,1
the view is amazing - day and night .,1
nice restaurant to get coffee and snacks from,1
take some time to walk around and get the picture that you do n't normally see .,1
"even though it the most famous land mark in paris , the real beauty of the eiffel tower is at night with all these beautiful lights that blinks with every o'clock .",1
that was apart from the walk up the stairs one - no thank you !,1
"we did not get to go up the tower due to time constraints , but still worth it to take a few pics and remember our trip .",1
it s looks like a magical city .,1
it 's a great photo opportunity .,1
but the view from the first level is sill pretty awesome if you do n't want to pay extra/wait in line .,1
that was actually a lot of fun to watch happen over and over again .,1
an amazing feat that has stood the test of time .,1
not a big deal .,1
took my adult son this trip and he did n't really want to go because it is sooooo touristy .,1
"other than that , it was an unforgettable visit for me and my wife !",1
visit it during the day and of course a must visit at night when lit up .,1
it was a first for the children and they really enjoyed it .,1
seeing it from the seine was almost better than being right there !,1
not enough time for the third .,1
we loved when the eiffel tower lit up every hour in the evening .,1
it is probably the best place in the world to count different nationalities in just one square quilometer .,1
this is a breath taking place in paris specially at night .,1
however tried to get ticket to the 3rd floor and stood in another queue for an hour but could n't purchase it .,1
"since we had both been here before years before , we decided to forego going up .",1
must see if you are in paris for the first time .,1
best get a table by the window it 's worth it .,1
when going to paris you really must visit the eiffel tower .,1
the view from the tower is worth every money spent .,1
"luckily , we went in may so it was n't super crowded .",1
wow it was breathtaking .,1
"the crowds were thick , as july/august are the busy times , but we went right to the front of the lines as part of the tour .",1
"to climb the eiffel tower had been high on my bucket list , and i finally got to go !",1
amazing views from both second and top floors .,1
the eiffel tower is obviously the cliche of paris .,1
"it was $ 7 each and hundreds of steps to the first floor and then she decided that we would continue up , not for the faint hearted .",1
we visit eiffel tower .,1
love love love the eiffel tower !,1
"a dream come true , an incredible view of the city .",1
separate security and elevator line for those with tickets - probably cut out several hours of waiting .,1
"you do n't really have to go up , the view of the structure itself is fascinating , and the area around it is great too !",1
nothing compares to the beauty of the real thing .,1
this time round the lights and romantic appeal lured us in and before we knew it we were going up the tower .,1
we had a picnic on a bench .,1
also !,1
so special !,1
"if you think this will get you in quicker , think again , anyone without a reservation was turned away and forced to go to the back of the main queue .",1
its truly stunning and its huge !,1
we did all see the tower at night when it was lit up and it is spectacular .,1
first tick of the europe bucket list .,1
"up close , the surrounding grounds leave a little to be desired ... more dirt than grass .",1
we have been here before and decided to come back but not go up .,1
the view was amazing and meanwhile we were up there the dakness fell over paris .,1
we went on a cold day and the lineups were long but it 's the eiffel tower !!,1
"the first thing you think of when you think of paris , is the eiffel tower .",1
loved being there !,1
"awesome , amazing views .",1
i would go just for the views and experience .,1
one of the seven wonders of the world .,1
there are shops inside where you can grab snacks .,1
very famous .,1
an hour to wait in the line .,1
"we arrived at around 6.20 pm , still light and very busy , just thinking of taking a few pictures then leaving .",1
we have heard about the beauty of this tower .,1
buyer beware .,1
"although booked tickets well ahead , still had long queues to get onto lifts .",1
see it by day and by night .,1
this is not exactly what you see in the pictures .,1
it 's definitely more comfortable to visit in the morning - later there 's a thousand tourists in the lines for the tickets .,1
in the night you should come back because,1
this was the favourite thing for my girls .,1
it was amazing both at night and during the day .,1
"yes i saved some time and that was worthy , but you can do the same for less if you book the admission in advance .",1
purchasing an advance tickets is a must !,1
"17 euros one and half hour queue for nothing apart from being a rip off , 5euros for half ltr bottle of coke just to say you have been up the eifel tower",1
make sure you go all the way to the top !,1
"just watch for the many african men , pickpockets and general conmen littered around the base of the tower",1
i saw a big box with pocket knives and lighters taken away .,1
"do yourself a favor , pre-book for a specific entry time online and avoid all the waiting .",1
the only downside was that they were painting - as they have to every seven years i think -lrb- which takes about two-three years to complete - so there was areas closed off and much scaffolding .,1
before you enter the lift lobby you will get to walk through the tower through the bottom .,1
"it was clean unfortunately only 2 entrances up in the tower were open and the queue was ever so long so we did n't venture up , but around the tower there were ride for the kids and a photographer thank goodness to stop them from being board and a nice little souvenir stall .",1
"lines too long for tickets , but you can experience the view fully from outside of the park .",1
liquids are allowed if you have children .,1
a must visit when in paris !,1
the 2nd and 3rd levels are great .,1
best view of paris !!!,1
the only downside is the queue which lasted about 3 hours and so we got up to the top a little bored .,1
"even so , we had to wait with everyone in a long line for security that including searching our bags and our persons with really little cover .",1
it was well worth it and actually less tourists and more locals were there .,1
fortunately for us it did not pour down rain until we finished our photo shoot .,1
"to see and go up the eiffel tower , is something i 've always wanted to do , my advice would be get there and queue very early as the queues get very long very quick or book a skip the queue ticket .",1
get your tickets a head of time and do n't worry about going to the top !,1
we had a nice tour guide but she was young and appeared inexperienced .,1
it 's the eiffel tower !!,1
"it took us up to the 2nd floor -lrb- you can add on trips in the lift to the top -rrb- , which for us was fine with great views over paris and good photo opportunities .",1
"it was gorgeous at this time , we watched the sunset , it was extremely romantic .",1
you get to see paris in its full perspective so you at least have to do it once .,1
it has some majestic attraction .,1
"be prepared to wait it out or , just walk around and enjoy the surroundings .",1
spectacular !!!,1
"but it 's not there is something about it that is just charming , we walked around the base of the tower and played in the parks .",1
that you have to pay for every level too is a bit much .,1
i prefer to just sit on the coffee places across the tower and enjoy my coffee looking in the tower rather than visiting and climbing the stairs .,1
"again , the lineups for the elevators an be quite long do i 'd recommend getting up there as soon as possible to avoid wasting any time .",1
"i also went for a meal at the restaurant , which has ample seating , friendly staff and beautiful views .",1
"great views of paris , not too expensive and also a must-see when in paris .",1
the eiffel tower was absolutely amazing .,1
be aware you have to allow time for travelling up and down the lifts as there are line ups and limited numbers can be taken at a time .,1
spring is definitely the time to choose to go up the tower !,1
however it is close up and at night whilst it was lit up that we saw its magnificence .,1
built to only be temporary its a structure that stands the test of time and looks amazing day or night and definitely worth a visit to gaze upwards at and walk around its perimeter .,1
"astonishing sights , the eiffel tower is an amazing sight just the sheer size is spectacular but at night when the light come on it is so pretty an amazing sight .",1
had not anticipated it would be so spectacular,1
you can not go to paris without seeing the tower .,1
once to get to the first floor you have to climb to the second floor .,1
we looked for shelter inside but there are n't any seats at all so we left quickly .,1
it is quite stunning to see and very romantic .,1
walked up the tower to the second platform and the views were a great reward .,1
the cost is roughly $ 20 american and worth it .,1
we were lucky to visit the eiffel tower all the way to the top during low peak season time so we barely had to wait in the queue .,1
it is all it 's cracked up to be but to avoid the mad queues and get some great views visit on an evening around 10ish .,1
it 's obviously a beautiful thing .,1
the bonus of going after dark is seeing the tower dancing with lights .,1
do n't waste money on buying from tourist agency .,1
last advice is take your champaigne with you because its extreemly expensive at the top .,1
"up there , have a glass of champagne from the little ` shop ' and gaze across the city laid out below .",1
"we did this as part of a tour of paris , i 'd highly recommend getting a skip the line ticket , the views are great over the city .",1
this is a must when you first visit paris .,1
i purchased the tickets online with a recommendation of my friend -lrb- was difficult but worth it instead of waiting in a long line -rrb- .,1
the first reason for this is that we only queued for 10minutes and it was at a peak time .,1
"another observation i had was there were people selling ` mini ' eiffel towers on the ground , and then you would see cops chasing them out .",1
loved it from first sight .,1
"if you 're fit , skip the longer lines for the elevator and take a walk up to the first and second levels - it 's quite an experience !",1
what can i say that has n't been said about this ?,1
"wonderful , we visited the restaurant , great service and surprisingly the food was excellent we pre booked for my husbands 50 th birthday , the only downside was having to wait outside for ages before being let into the restaurant",1
i visited this in august and it was pleasant weather there .,1
highly recommend that you go there - a must see !,1
a must see at least once tourist attraction .,1
"if you 'd rather just admire the tower from the park , yes , you can .",1
"nothing less than amazing , very crowded -lrb- august -rrb- 2 hours waiting line , but worth it.if you want to eat at the restaurant you must book in advance , unfortunately i did n't know .",1
you have to visit and go up the top .,1
free advice - if at all possible avoid paris from june thru august - crowds were horrible !!!!,1
"be mindful of the pick pockets and scammers , keep your valuables on you at all times and do n't respond to the women , who have clip boards , when they ask if you speak english , just ignore them and keep walking .",1
have to have to visit the top of the tower .,1
level 2 is smaller so it can be very crowded .,1
"amazing , everything you think of and more ... just be early to avoid the insane queues or do what we did and had lunch at the le jules verne restaurant",1
who can visit paris and not go to the eiffel tower ?,1
it cost 17 euros for a adult or 14.50 euros for 18-24 .,1
"beautiful , majestic and very memorable .",1
"do yourself a favor : buy a crepe , find a patch of grass or bench , sit down and people-watch in one of the most romantic places on earth .",1
our hotel was 10 minutes walking distance to the eiffel tower .,1
10 mins from level 2 .,1
ha,1
absolutely beautiful and well worth the trip .,1
visit in the day for a clear view and at night so you can see it light up !,1
she took us to the top level and was eager to share her experience .,1
we visited the torre eiffel in april .,1
we had the best time ever and the kids throughly enjoyed our trip to paris !,1
the structure itself is amazing .,1
"it was worth the trip first thing in the morning , took the lift right up ... took in the amazing view and experience of going up the iconic tower with the kids .",1
we had champagne on the top which was a great touch !,1
in special holidays like easter it can take hours ... in any case is the eiffel tower so it deserves a visit !!,1
nice to sit on the grass in a nearby park and have a picnic .,1
"i assume all this is a response to justifiable security concerns , but visitors might want this heads up to diminish their expectations .",1
beware of pickpockets and street vendors and artists .,1
great place to visit,1
it is awesome to see eiffel from other parts of the city .,1
at 2 weeks before my trip all tickets were sold out so really need to book at least 1 month in advance .,1
"a must see , such beautiful views of paris from all angles .",1
"but do n't try to get in the elevator , you need to wait many hours ... disappointed about that .",1
iconic tower in paris .,1
naturally worth a visit if you 're in paris .,1
i travel a lot and i still suggest it for several reasons :,1
"the park grounds and landscaping are currently being completely renovated , but that does n't change the experience of seeing paris from far above .",1
the view is extraordinary .,1
better to get up and go in the morning as the queues build up really fast .,1
many men selling mini eiffel towers .,1
"eiffel tower one of the place i would like to visit since i was kid , i visited eiffel tower sept less crowded but queue will be still there , as we did not manage to purchase online we just decided to walk in , we decided to take stairs up to second floor continue with the lift to summit , amazingly beautiful landmark , great view from top , we enjoyed our visit .",1
security was on high alert checking every bag and person as they entered the grounds and again when they entered the tower so felt safe .,1
not one photo from the top -lrb- gutted -rrb- .,1
"only one elevator was working and the line took for ever but you try to forget all this when you get on the elevator and start going up , it is great experience and you never get enough of it no matter how many times you 've been there .",1
spectacular views do nit disappoint .,1
"amazing view , good to take a coffee with a view .",1
you 've got ta go though !,1
"although it is hard to miss , the eiffel tower is a must do .",1
went for the day to the eiffel tower .,1
"yet , when in paris you should see it at night .",1
it 's nice that you can just sit on the lawn till dark and get pictures .,1
"we were in the lineups -lrb- security , tickets , and elevators -rrb- for hours with two kids .",1
no big bags allowed .,1
"but enjoy it , very special .",1
"this is , i suppose , to prevent scalping , which is a good thing overall .",1
all the days we had in paris had great weather apart from the day we went to the eiffel tower .,1
"this fall day , the ground temps were in the mid 60s , but we were glad we packed our windbreakers and down vests !",1
be aware it is tourist central .,1
"definitely book the tickets online - you go almost straight inside , there is a separate queue to security check for those who already have the reservation and separate queue to the elevator itself .",1
you have to make 2 trips .,1
"yes , it 's a must see and you must photograph it when in paris .",1
"preordered tickets , do n't go without .",1
it 's basically steel scaffolding with 3 platforms .,1
"we went at night and saw paris all lit up , what a wonderful experience .",1
its equally beautiful on the ground around and under it as it is looking out over paris while up on it .,1
to see the tower was breath taking .,1
the views were magnificent .,1
the most iconic beautiful romantic building in the world !,1
would go back in a heart beat .,1
"shining , sparkling and colorful .",1
"we did n't go to the very top , but just took the stairs -lrb- a lot of them ! -rrb-",1
the best time to go there is before it gets dark and you spend some times there until it gets dark .,1
"let 's face it , it 's one of the reasons you come to paris to see .",1
we had only a few hours in paris and decided to see the tower .,1
a -rrb- less wait .,1
"no visit would be comple without coming to see the eiffel tower , especially at night time when it is all lit up .",1
we really enjoyed the views and made sure we had a glass of champagne .,1
bastille day so had to walk nearly all the way home from watching the firework .,1
"the first check to go through is security , then it 's on to the next line for tickets , then you queue for the elevator .",1
if we had needed to buy tickets at the bottom of the tower the wait would have been much longer .,1
"viator is excellent , flexible and a good value .",1
"i 'm 61 years old and have creaky knees , but managed the stairs down just fine , just went slowly .",1
the day we went there the lifts were closed due to a social strike .,1
"to then think you 'll be up the tower experiencing magnificent views , to wait about an hour and a half :-lrb- this was supposedly a priority ticket i think not !",1
"the kids were wary to go up the tower , but once they did , they were very happy they did .",1
"however , the best view imho of a dazzling eiffel is from trocadero gardens as you can literally feel that there is a gateway leading to the tower .",1
"she led us through the lines , security -lrb- you are allowed cameras -rrb- , and looked after us for the hour and a half tour before leaving us to our own devices .",1
we walked down the many many steps -- fun .,1
it was n't a nice day but still worth a trip up this historic landmark .,1
it is a must see if you go to paris !,1
"intitially , i bought tickets to ride up to the second floor with a tour group , but ended up buying the additional ticket to go to the very top lookout for just 6 # .",1
"dinner for 2 in the lower eiffel tower restaurant , over looking the seine river , 2 glasses of champagne , wine , 2 appitzers , 2 entries , 2 deserts and coffee , super service and a view that is unsurpassed on the planet earth , this is the place .",1
"the lines were excruciatingly long ... allow at least two hours , the scenery once up there is breathtaking .",1
the ambiance and view were unbeatable !,1
the eiffel tower is a place that has to be visited .,1
my fiancee got advance booking tickets as a surprise and that way we did n't have to face a long queue !,1
we went to the second level which had amazing views of the city .,1
paris most famous landmark .,1
and you can skip the queues .,1
after several visits to paris we finally went to see the eiffel tower and it was just super .,1
it definitely has to be a memorable visit to the iconic structure of the world - eiffel tower .,1
she is absolutely hugh but beautiful .,1
ques for the lifts are very long but otherwise it was a nice experience .,1
my husband has a smart watch and the smart watch alerted him that the phone was more then 30feet away that 's how he realized he was pick pocketed .,1
it is a must see for everyone .,1
there is 670 steps up to the 2nd floor .,1
one of the hot spots you and your family can ever visit !,1
"we went up to level 3 , but it felt that level 2 offered better views mainly because it did n't have the same safety fence around the edges .",1
thought twice to drop the plan .,1
is gorgeous landmark that is beautiful and fun - and defines a trip to paris .,1
we tried to purchase tickets on-line months in advance but with no success .,1
romantic place to visit for every couple .,1
it was more fun too .,1
take a boat trip down the seine river at night - its well worth the stunning view !,1
get there early as the lines can be extremely long .,1
just thrilling .,1
i do n't think you can experience a structure quite like it anywhere in the world especially one with such a beautiful city surrounding it .,1
i do n't know but the feeling of just sitting there watching and looking at the tower is really a wonderful feeling that you can always remember this is not only for lover 's but even if you 're with you friends and family this is also a must see in paris most specially at night .,1
"the wind was biting cold that day and despite this , the view was pretty amazing , the architecture of the tower itself magnificent and the old school elevator was charming .",1
i had visited paris multiple times but had n't been to the top of the eiffel tower since 1987 .,1
however try and arrive early as the queues seem to get bigger throughout the day .,1
eiffel tower is the most important monument in paris .,1
the queues were long winding snakes full of people waiting patiently to by tickets to go up in the lift .,1
went up to the top and it is worth to visit .,1
you really can not miss this and say you have been to paris .,1
a good tip is to go to straight to the summit which saves on delays at first or second stage .,1
it saves you a long wait in the line and costs less than the elevator ride .,1
the only way to minimise your exposure to crowds at this landmark is to climb to the second level .,1
there are lots of shops around the tower and there is a big queue to go up but it is well worth it !!!!,1
the views are incredible !,1
"if you are in for some romance you can buy a flute of champs on the top , but it 's pricey -lrb- $ 10 or so -rrb- .",1
"crowded , crowded and more crowded .",1
truly iconic .,1
"thirdly , make sure to go up and see the amazing views of paris .",1
"for a fee , you can go up to the observation decks at the top .",1
"no to roses being shoved in your face , no to young gypsies sticking petitions in your face , no to being offered a `` selfie '' stick every 5 metres .",1
if you like tall things you should have a look .,1
"in fact , the trip to just visit this site is well worth the time and effort .",1
amazing to see and visit .,1
it absolutely poored down whilst we were going up but it was still worth it !,1
the next night we set the alarm for 2:15 a.m and as soon as the tickets went on sale at 8:30 a.m paris time we were ready to go !,1
we chose the stairs option which had a much shorter line .,1
finnaly got my ticket and went up .,1
do n't know why these people are allowed to ruin a visit to a world famous monument .,1
i 'm 29 and in good shape .,1
obviously a must visit when you are in paris .,1
it does this on the hour until the tower closes so is well worth waiting for .,1
just go there and enjoy to maximum !,1
definitely a must see and it is worth to pay more to get on a tour in order to get tickets without having to line up .,1
waaaoo is the only word,1
brilliant !,1
beware of large groups who expect to all go past you in one go !,1
covering the entire tower .,1
the tour ended on the second floor -lrb- about 10:30 a -rrb- and we purchased tickets there to continue to the top .,1
"even though i thought it is nothing else but steel and will be borin , it actually was amazing and interesting .",1
just beware of all the rude tourists !!,1
"pack your patience , a little snack or lunch and after you finally get to the top you will say , '' it was worth the wait '' .",1
"i can not imagine visiting paris without going to see this lovely wonder , and even if you are afraid of heights like i am , i still went up to the second level to enjoy the views .",1
"the original eiffel tower are by far the most beautiful of all , i 've visited the replicas but the view from the top are breathtaking !",1
needless to say the tower itself is worth a visit anyway and the views are great .,1
highlight of our visit to paris was our time spent at the eiffel tower .,1
"the view is spectacular , you wo n't be disappointed .",1
what an amazing experience it was having dinner at restaurant 58 on the first floor of the eiffel tower !,1
the weather was stunning when we visited so it was very busy .,1
"and the perfect , perfect views 360 degrees view of paris .",1
"what can i say about eiffel tower , i think not possible finding new words to explain how magical is this emblem !",1
it 's amazing to see the construction up close and on a clear day the views are great .,1
"if the weather is not great that day , would n't suggest go to the top since not much will be visible anyway .",1
also beautiful .,1
we finally made it !,1
"great light show on the tower , great atmosphere , not crazy busy like times square !!",1
definitely more our cup of tea than being herded around with the tourists .,1
this makes the eiffel tower stand out on its own .,1
"despite the cold , the view from the upper deck was irresistible .",1
"if afraid of heights , avoid the outside level on top floors .",1
wonderful views giving a sense of the scale and beauty of paris .,1
"we went up , took pictures , appreciated the view and went down .",1
do not think it is necessary .,1
"it looked beautiful from far and once i saw it up close , it was ok .",1
iconic,1
you must go and see it by yourself .,1
magestic and beautiful .,1
if only it did not rain .,1
we bought tickets online to the summit .,1
the eiffel tower did n't disappoint .,1
"we went back during the day , just because and it was beautiful but she wears diamonds at night .",1
if you have n't been up yet ... what are you waiting for ?,1
still any time i am in paris i go there .,1
"markets , food vendors , and of course there are those pesky street vendors , but oh well .",1
also book the tickets asap because they sell out quickly .,1
this is clearly necessary -lrb- the french do resemble a nation in fear - there are even armed soldiers patrolling some of the railway stations -rrb- but it does spoil the view of the tower and especially the once lush parkland surrounding it -lrb- most of which is no longer accessible -rrb- .,1
it 's almost impossible to visit paris without visiting the eiffel tower at least once .,1
definitely one to see .,1
"if you ca n't get a reserved time to the very top , purchase tickets to the 2nd level .",1
my experience in the eiffel tower was very adventurous .,1
there are three levels in the eiffel tower the lower one the middle one and the upper one which is very high .,1
although it has a good system and maintenance in place .,1
go both day and night .,1
-lrb- walking up stairs - not with elevator .,1
the public restroom was out of order .,1
and the people who are doing the security checks are rude and pushy .,1
the view is fabulous .,1
"it was very interested more than i thought.please be careful for juggler around the tower.all of people around them are with juggler and if you interested , will missed money certainly !",1
i would definitely recommend seeing the eiffel tower,1
something out of romantic novels or disney .,1
"organised via hayes travel at around # 90 each - great food , friendly staff and lovely views ; good vfm ; unforgettable !",1
perfect time for a family visit .,1
"it appeared that they were trying to keep the people queueing cool with dry ice mist being released overhead , but when i reached that part , it was missing everyone completely .",1
"i was a little nervous to travel with my family in paris during the euro 2016 tournament , but i have to commend the french for their security measures to keep travelers safe !",1
"unfortunately , it loses a lot of its charm bc it 's surrounded by security fences galore , an unfortunate necessity .",1
the sommelier paired the wines to accommodate our taste .,1
"the line to go up can be long , but it 's the eiffel ... you have to do it at least once !",1
it saved us a lot of time .,1
it was a lifetime experience .,1
expect long lines .,1
"if you are able to buy your tickets ahead of time -lrb- weeks in advance -rrb- , or if you are willing to spend more do a tour .",1
this area is not only packed but filthy and unsecure .,1
champagne on the summit of the eiffel tower .,1
reached a bit too late and long queue for tickets .,1
the eiffel tower has three levels .,1
"the visit generally is not very well organized - you need to stay in a queue for some time to buy tickets , then present things for a security check up .",1
three years ago i brought my grandsons to paris and went online to reserve places on the elevator for the last time available on friday night .,1
vendors are everywhere so be choosy on the prices you pay .,1
i 'm curious of the restaurants up in this tower ; p,1
"although it was a man-made structure , it was made with the finest diligence , but hard material !",1
at night it sparkles every hour - so fun !!,1
a must see for any traveller visiting paris .,1
even though we got a specific time to go up we still ended up going up about and hour after our time slot because it was so busy .,1
the eifle tower is better appreciated from below .,1
"therefore , we only found parking at the parking house .",1
also alain ducasse -lrb- michelin star chef -rrb- has a restaurant here !!,1
"it costs 5 euros -lrb- for students -rrb- , and 7 euros -lrb- adults -rrb- to climb to the midpoint of the eiffel tower , which offers an amazing panorama of the city .",1
very busy as usual .,1
"nice to see , as i did n't know before , that there is a little room where g. eiffel would entertain .",1
this was made very easy with our vouchers for all tours being emailed to us .,1
do not support these people as their activity is illegal .,1
"everyday i have to walk through the eiffel tower and its never enough to look at it , the part that is in front of the tower , always has some movement going on , little kids , mostly people with dogs and exercising , the carrousel , hotdog , crepe stand .",1
walking around the eiffel tower is just magical !!,1
"the eiffel tower is simply the best -- crowded , yes , but fun to visit and with great views .",1
"the views from the top are spectacular , i 'd do it again and again .",1
my recommendation is to choose a tour group only if it is worth your time .,1
i mean who wouldnt give a five star to eiffel !,1
be patience to wait in long lines : to buy the tickets and to get in the tower .,1
cool experience .,1
we visited during the day and it was so much bigger than expected .,1
its old i know but still a beauty .,1
"security was high , which was comforting .",1
i got there at 10am but still had to wait over an hour in line .,1
legs was like jelly in the lift watching the lift go up and seeing the amazing views of this beautiful city .,1
but somehow me and friends did not get a `` jaw dropping '' moment when we saw the tower .,1
as everyone knows you ca n't come to paris and not visit the eiffel tower,1
wonderful to visit at night !,1
the atmosphere is fantastic and it offers amazing night time views !,1
once you are on the lift going to the second floor you have an amazing sensation that you are about to experience something special !,1
"a gentleman at the information booth directed us to the `` self cleaning '' portable washroom around the corner , where we waited over an hour to use .",1
during the weekend daytime there was a lot of families and joggers as well as bride and grooms taking wedding pictures .,1
unfortunately the top level was closed as too many people and we would have to wait over an hour to buy tickets on level 2 .,1
when in paris - just do it .,1
"next time i would be more relaxed and go up if convenient and good weather , otherwise skip it until another time .",1
wow what a great view from the top worth a visit .,1
definitely worth the money to explore this iconic landmark - the views are breathtaking !,1
"we went to the top of the eiffel tower , it was amazing to see paris from there .",1
as paris is so beautiful it is a good idea to get there on foot walking by the river .,1
you can get souvenirs .,1
"i been there with my family , it was very nice experience , lifts were fast & big , if you want to make pictures 2 floor is best for view , night time 10 clock lights lit up & it 's nice to see that beauty of eiffel tower .",1
the whole experience took a little over an hour .,1
go early or prepare to wait for hours .,1
even for stairs .,1
obviously you can not go to france without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"the eiffel tower is one of the most touristic places in paris , so obviously it is very crowded .",1
"you need to buy a ticket to go up , but you can get discount if you buy a five day métro pass , but it 's well worth the wait , the queues move pretty quickly .",1
it 's beauty is different during the day and even more beautiful at night as it glitters .,1
"while in the ticket line they posted a 40 min delay from the second floor to the top and by the time we got to the ticket window the top was closed so we just went to the second floor , this is still pretty high with great views of the entire city the view from the top must be spectacular .",1
superb design of iron/steel structure .,1
the line for tickets will be long but it 's worth going up once in your life .,1
do not go to the eiffel tower in the middle of the day on a warm weekend !,1
was a wonderful few hours .,1
the views from the second deck are just as good as the views from the top .,1
we visited the eiffel tower at night and fortunately were there at 10pm as on the hour every hour the tower glistens and its spectacular .,1
it 's got the breathtaking views from the top .,1
"on the day we went , not all the ticket booths were open , despite the long queues , and this was frustrating .",1
it is all it is suppose to be .,1
i would recommend going early if possible as the ticket lineups we crazy .,1
i think i took 100 photos !,1
"great experience , excellent food , beautiful breath taking views a must try restaurant when visit paris -lrb- book in advance at least a month before you get there",1
we had baguettes -lrb- ham and butter -rrb- and a beer sitting on an outside bench on the second floor and watched night fall .,1
only downfall so many tourists but you get over that pretty quick when you see the view .,1
i will focus only on the visit in the tower itself and not its surrounds .,1
bought tickets online two months prior and access was quick and easy .,1
"climbing to the top of the tower was an enthralling experience and then having a champagne there , was amazing !!",1
the climb was not difficult at all even for the children who were around 10 yo .,1
cherry blossom around the tower !!,1
we went up the eiffel tower in the day time and did n't find the queue too bad although did opt to climb up the steps to the second level which is tiring .,1
no cans .,1
opted for the summit ticket and was not disappointed with the 360 views .,1
"the sacre coeur was lit up green , the observation wheel was lit up green and being able to see all the sights of paris was cool .",1
"absolutely fantastic if you get the chance see it at night , as it is an unforgettable experience !!!",1
arrived via taxi at 7:45 pm and stood in a 10 min line .,1
i am somewhat scared of heights but i did n't find this scary at all .,1
no line at tower h. bad idea to pre book .,1
this time we visited the tower with our children ages 15 and 11 .,1
and ask you to fill up a survey .,1
awesome spot for a picnic ... some cheese and wine w an amazing view !,1
"it is a great feeling to be there , to see paris from such a high point .",1
still beautiful amazing structure .,1
"the views and been up the tower it 's self was amazing , the food and service in the restaurant on the other hand was not .",1
it is safe and you will enjoy walking on the glass .,1
"i would highly recommend buying tickets ahead of time , however , as those without were waiting in a line that was at least three hours long !",1
very nice and romantic .,1
i visited paris with my 4year old son and we decided to go and have a look at the eiffel tower .,1
once we went into the park side it was much better and relaxed .,1
my wife and i went to the top of the eiffel tower during the daytime .,1
"meaning if you want back in , you go thru security again .",1
best is to see the sunset from there .,1
what a lot of people under this tower .,1
they light up when the champagne is poured in .,1
"if you have time , i highly recommend making your way to the top pf the tower for gorgeous city views .",1
a few touts but quite mild and nothing bad .,1
dress warmly -lrb- it 's windy out there ! -rrb-,1
"lovely views of the city but very crowded , even though we had no lines or a wait .",1
so there are always a lot of people at the tower .,1
"unfortunately , as we got to the cash desk , the overcrowded summit was closed until further notice because so many people were up there .",1
we could n't do that because of our schedule .,1
we were in paris to celebrate my 50th birthday we had lunch in the eiffel tower restaurant which was excellent and great value for money,1
i got lucky both times because the weather was great !,1
the building itself is n't very appealing with its rusty colour .,1
the structure is beautiful and the top was just as i had imagined .,1
i was so happy to finally see it in person .,1
"we loved learning the history of the eiffel tower and getting a behind the scene tour of the engine room , as well as getting to access the champs de mars bunker and learn the role it played in military communication during the war .",1
we purchased ticket ahead to avoid the lines and it was the best thing we did .,1
"loved the views , simple queuing system and not expensive .",1
this place is very crowdy and if you like to see the tower with less people and from the distance view so cross the river seine and climb up to the trocadero area and you will have an wonderful view to the tower and the mars field behind .,1
"as a family traveling with a stroller , the mass of people near the tower was a bit stressful - primarily on the sidewalks .",1
sorry for my desperation to get down to assist my wife .,1
"however , we specifically liked the first sausage sandwich shop which comes your way when u r coming from bir hakeim station to eiffel .",1
there are many places around that you can get great shots of the tower .,1
one exactly after one day of the attack by truck driver at nice .,1
delinquency is everywhere and they let you know with big signs .,1
it 's beautiful all lit up .,1
came with my daughter and had a great time .,1
take the subway .,1
it is pretty cheap at 17 euros to go to the very top .,1
he was knowledgeable and entertaining .,1
"i erred ever so slightly , in that i should have had us exit the metro at trocadero , which is across the seine , but there is a platform there where you can get the best photos of yourself with the tower behind you .",1
c'est tre beau .,1
for better views of paris consider the top of notre dame and especially sacre couer .,1
fantastic views from all vantage points .,1
"this meal was more than 500 euro , but the price for the location -- the eiffel tower !!!",1
walk down from the 2nd level if you can .,1
"if you do visit , buy the skip-the-line passes , you 'll be so much more happier .",1
no large bags .,1
nothing compares to view on the top of this gigantic structure .,1
the kids had so much fun and literally sprinted up the stairs .,1
lots of people trying to sell you something .,1
"food and waiter service at the restaurant were wonderful , as was the magnificent view from window table !",1
we bought tickets in advance online and went right up .,1
we chose to walk up the eiffel tower .,1
"we spread out in the adjacent park and drank a nice bottle of rose while marveling at , the tower .",1
nice park around the towers .,1
why not go at sunset .,1
"such a beautiful tower , especially at night when it sparkles !",1
"it is a beautiful site , and just as beautiful from the ground .",1
the best visit ever !,1
take the time to have a good look at the structure as it 's pretty amazing .,1
this was on the list of things that i really wanted to do in paris .,1
at 1000 feet in height the views from the top are stunning .,1
looks charming in the yellow light .,1
it is because it saves a lot of time and is not really a challenge which does not meet the child several years old .,1
"really quite manageable , even with an 11-year old .",1
"on this trip we took the stairs and paid 11 euro each to do so , this took us as far as the ` second teir ' , which to me was much , much higher than i expected .",1
queue is long but worth it,1
"i also explored the 1st level and surprised to know there is an iceskating rink , restaurant and snacks , convention center , glass walkway .",1
its size is unreal in person and the park is such a nice place to spend the day in .,1
i had a great time in paris and could n't leave without going to the summit of the eiffel tower with its amazing views of the city .,1
"try to have dinner at the restaurant in the tower too , it was amazing !",1
"the eiffel tower was n't open the day we went , but it was still wonderful to walk the grounds .",1
plan carefully to avoid the long lines - we arrived early in the morning before it opened and had a relatively short ~ 1 hour wait -lrb- while it opened -rrb- .,1
"i 've done both of these and enjoyed both for different reasons , the view from both is amazing but different .",1
have seen on foot - take the metro to trocadero and just walk round - if you have a wee one with you take a ride on the victorian style carousel x a msut,1
plan to reach the top by evening .,1
"however , the atmosphere here is great and i loved sitting on the green waiting for the tower to light up .",1
i chose the north elevator .,1
it was crowded and long lines to go up into the tower so just walked around .,1
the light show hourly was also a treat .,1
looking forward to returning to paris and other areas of france one day .,1
the view was so worth it .,1
"you 'll see it everywhere , everyday , from every different angle and you 'll be in love .",1
"we did n't pay to go up due to limited time , and there were quite large queues - even for early morning in december .",1
"i visited the top floor , and it was all chilly there .",1
"its the eiffel tower , feel the love , grab a glass of champagne and take in the view and fall in love again , even fall in love with paris !!!",1
i live in paris so i have seen and visited the tower many times .,1
the new glass walkway viewing area on level 1 is not for the faint hearted .,1
"the guide was prompt , ticked us off , gave us our tickets to go up .",1
grab a sandwich and enjoy a nice picnic in the park along the eiffel tower .,1
maybe because years of watching romantic movies and waiting for the special something to happen .,1
but this is really still stunning that this was built 128 years ago .,1
there are confidence artists and pick pockets that the police do nothing about .,1
the guide explained the history of the tower and the history of several monuments in paris that are visible from the second level .,1
recommend the visit,1
the queue to elevators was moving pretty slow but it was n't long .,1
our tour guide john is a history buff and loved doing the tour and sharing his knowledge with our small group .,1
"personally , i ca n't imagine anyone who can leave paris without seeing eiffel tower !",1
well worth the line to get to the top .,1
"been to the eiffel tower many times , but never bothered to get advance tickets to ride the elevator to the top .",1
we loved level 2 .,1
since i wanted to see it both during the day and at night we went back around 9 and took the elevator up !!,1
"just keep your valuables in sight and your cards , passport , etc at the hotel in the safe .",1
a visit to the eiffel tower is something to be experienced and a meal at the restaurant adds to the attraction .,1
it got us upto the top of the eiffel tower with express entrance ... .,1
i visited eiffel tower during my second visit to paris .,1
we had the best !,1
way too crowded and touristy .,1
we booked in to see the eiffel tower with blue bike tours `` skip-the-line '' tour .,1
the line up to get tickets looked so long that people would have had to be waiting for 2hrs in the hot sun .,1
"1st floor has a new transparent floor and a lot of people didnot visit this floor , but its really worth exploring .",1
wonderful view .,1
"if it is your first time visiting the eiffel tower , i would recommend taking a tour with city wonders .",1
this is a must for everyone .,1
gift shops are not very interesting .,1
"it 's full of tourist , but nice for good pics and there 's a really nice little park off to the side to enjoy the outdoors .",1
my 7 year old 's favourite part of the trip .,1
"booked tickets in advance , very reassuring to have increased security , just make sure you give yourself little extra time .",1
most overrated attraction in all of europe,1
"we lucked out and went mid afternoon and had almost no lines to ride to the top , no need for skip the line tix .",1
lived the experience of seeing the tower esp at night .,1
after a long climb you can see panoramic views of the whole city .,1
on the second level they were very attentive and made sure she was enjoying her visit .,1
the eiffel tower is a treat wherever you see it from and whether it is during the day or light up at night .,1
best photos can be taken in the park or up on the cement platforms across the street from the eiffel .,1
"the lines were n't too bad , and we were able to go all the way to the top .",1
nice and romantic place .,1
the restaurant on the first floor was great and the service was amazing .,1
there is also lots of tiffs .,1
i do n't think you can prepare yourself for how tall it is until you get there .,1
we enjoyed the trip to the eiffel tower .,1
"it 's actually quite affordable , and the lines are n't too long compared to other places .",1
but becareful with your wallet or bags .,1
a absolute must-see in paris !,1
"i prefer going at night time , seeing it light up is amazing and worth seeing .",1
"strongly suggest ` skip the line ' guided tour , thru viator !!!",1
it is definitely worth a visit no matter what .,1
went here at night time and it was just absolutely beautiful .,1
we had a good friend -lrb- french -rrb- with us so it was even better spending time with loved ones .,1
a little expensive for champagne in a plastic flute but how often are you at the top of the eiffel tower ?!,1
too many incredible places to eat in paris without spending money on mediocre,1
forget the men selling wine and champagne for $ 20 - grab a cheaper bottle from a monoprix and find a park bench to sit and enjoy the view .,1
the view is incomparable .,1
you do n't need to go up to the top the line ups are long .,1
the view us awe-inspiring and gives a lovely perspective of the view .,1
best to go walk around the outside or take a bateau mouche and see it from the water .,1
this one meets under the leg of the tower .,1
we spent our time taking photos and exploring the floors we were on .,1
at night there is nothing more spectacular,1
sabastien is a knowledgable guide -- learned lots about paris ... since he 's a native .,1
we did not get tickets ahead as we heard you can wait a long time to pick them up .,1
you have to see the eiffel tower .,1
i do n't wanted to leave but unfortunately we had to go more further and see my other choices of places .,1
we bought tix and went up to the 2nd floor viewing deck .,1
there was a queue for the elevators and they crammed the elevator full .,1
"it was 50 years since my last visit and nice to see that they have expanded some of the venue to offer more for , visitors making the visit more pleasant .",1
one note previously you could walk under the eiffel without a ticket now that has been blocked and you have to go through some security checks .,1
we visited both during the afternoon and at night -lrb- in the same day -rrb- on a saturday .,1
"we booked tickets in advance , saved us a lot of time in the line .",1
go just before sunset and pay the 17 euros to go to the summit .,1
also you might find a mist surrounded eiffel tower which has its own charms .,1
however a word of warning .,1
what can i say ??,1
the eiffel tower is as amazing as i thought it would be .,1
"it 's an impressive feat of engineering , and the views from the top are phenomenal .",1
it 's easier .,1
"a steady wait for the lifts to the second level , then more of a wait to enter the smaller lifts to the top .",1
buy online fast pass to avoid the long line ticket booth .,1
the same restrictions for champ de mars .,1
but u must go the topmost level as the view is breathtaking .,1
one of the best observation place i have been to .,1
better to wait until late night and then watch the tower lite up .,1
it was fun and tiring .,1
obviously a must see .,1
you were allowed to walk around and take in the view between courses .,1
this memory will be with us for a lifetime .,1
"everyone 's face has the excitement , nervousness and fulfillment look ... something that says , i made it here ... finally !",1
there were people popping wine and champagne all around us and the cops there did n't say a thing .,1
when walking through do n't make eye contact or they will follow you .,1
saw it during the daytime when the scene is relaxed .,1
it is worth the time and it does not cost any extra .,1
this is something you have to see in the daylight and again at night lit up .,1
goes without saying it define paris,1
be aware that the security lines to get in can be quite long so budget your time accordingly .,1
", but well worth the wait !",1
in morning & in evening .,1
so nice to wake up to that view .,1
"there may be a few structures taller and bigger , but the grace that eiffel tower enjoys , is unmatched .",1
best to order your ticket on line and get a time slot then get it the fast lane .,1
"even on a foggy day , it was surprisingly worth the wait .",1
"fui com minha esposa e nossa filhinha jantar na torre , e foi fantástico !",1
only downsides are that the second floor gets very crowded as even those who paid to go to the top have to queue for the second elevator here and it can be hard to move .,1
we took the lift -lrb- $ 17 -rrb- and the quite quickly .,1
"you can choose any leg to climb , on foot if you prefer , but beware , lots of steps .",1
"we went to see the eiffel from trocadero about 4 pm , still too early for sunset , be wary of young teenagers making you sign a petition - actually a ploy for a donation - even demanding a $ 20 minimum donation - what a scam !",1
"surrounding area is bit dusty , my new boots got spoiled within the first half an hour !!",1
"in person , so much more than anticipated , as other reviewers have noted .",1
iconic ?,1
please be cautious .,1
all very interesting .,1
a must visit for anyone travelling to paris and for those not visiting is something to look forward to .,1
because of current situation armed military near by and checks for bags going to the toilet .,1
"we purchased a tour from viator and had a wonderful visit the food was great , the wine was even better .",1
the tower is especially beautiful at night .,1
"when you are really looking up to the top from the bottom of eiffel tower , the feeling is really beyond any words that you could ever imagine .",1
"it 's expensive , but a lot of fun .",1
definitely worth the visit if you can afford the time .,1
we only had to wait about 15 minutes before the elevator took us up .,1
could n't ask for a more romantic spot .,1
go up before sunset and you can see the lights of the city come on .,1
i visited the eiffel tower on a cold day in march 2016 and was in absolute awe of this incredible structure .,1
it was all so magical and romantic .,1
make sure you order tickets weeks if not a month or 2 in advance .,1
"part of history here , buy your ticket in advance online and skip the line to buy .",1
"the view is spectacular , you can pretty see all of the city of paris including the river seine .",1
"it is worth booking beforehand , however , it looked very easy to buy tickets onsite .",1
the lines were short and we were able to go all the way to the top .,1
the eiffel tower is a must but my favourite time is at night when it is all lit up .,1
it is worth the visit if you are n't scared of heights !,1
"thinking back , i remember a man bumping into me and that must have been when he snatched the purse .",1
no queues .,1
it is easily one of the most visited attractions in the world but for all its hype it did n't quite meet my expectations .,1
"if you ever go to paris you must go and visit the eiffel tower , if you get a chance book dinner a few months in advance to eat in the restaurant there , must be patient as the ques can be very long .",1
it was quiet when we went so photos are great .,1
what you get is a magical evening altogether .,1
it would have also been fun to bring towels and wine and have a lunch picnic all day .,1
eiffel was so nice to see at night with the light show .,1
love all the help and support they gave us and made the trip that bit more enjoyable !!,1
picnic lunches - well priced - make a reservation .,1
stunning photos .,1
"you just have to visit , it is really impressive at night when its lights are on ,",1
we enjoyed the views from the ground as much as those from the top .,1
was apprehensive going to this iconic tourist attraction after the recent terrorist attacks but there was plenty of security in and around the eiffel tower .,1
"thieves are everywhere on the tower , so hang on to your things like your life depends on it !!!!",1
"the eiffel at night , is the most beautiful sight in the world .",1
"i went there with my husband , even if it was closed due to security problem.there weweremany tourist like me , who couldnt give up to be there.truly a icon !",1
go to the summit and take your time to point out the landmarks and you will be amazed at what you can see .,1
"i have been here 15 years now and to this day , seeing the eiffel tower brings a warm feeling to my heart .",1
to the front of the line to the lift .,1
"we had reserved tickets to go to the top of the tower but unfortunately due to the terrorists attack on friday night the tower was closed , in memory of the 128 people who were killed , as well as all the food stands and gift shops that are in area of the benches .",1
our intention was to climb the tower until we got up close enough to see its size .,1
we arrived on a thursday night and is was really quiet so when the weekend rolled around the huge crowds were a surprise .,1
i would suggest trying to go during the week so its less crowded .,1
good coffee while we waited too .,1
the lawns around the tower servers as a place to sit and relax esp .,1
"amazing atmosphere , crepes on the go and a lot of fun !!!",1
an absolute must in paris !,1
"whether you take a walk around the grounds , have a picnic on the grass in front , or pay to go up the eiffel tower , it is worthwhile .",1
stunningly beautiful architect but beware of pick-pockets and pushy touts selling what can only be described as tack .,1
but the sunrise pictures from trocadero are by far the best .,1
she is an attractive structure .,1
we did n't brave the crowds to go up the tower .,1
"we paid euro 11.00 to get up there and because of the timing that we were there -lrb- around 5pm -rrb- , surprisingly there were n't many people and there was no queue .",1
there is a metro close by and bars and restaurants .,1
we went at night and were very glad we did : you can see more detail when it is illuminated against a dark sky than when you 're squinting against a daytime sky .,1
"area around the tower is extremely happening , the view from the top is affable and if you have lot of money - dine at the top for the great experience .",1
"as others have said , no visit to paris is complete with out visiting the tower .",1
buy the trip with blue bike which will help you go up faster .,1
"ok this is what you do , if you did not buy your lift tickets 3 months in advance which is what is recommended , and you leave it to the last minute like me , you get there early in the day , get in the line that has a picture of the stairs .",1
"loved going up to the top , i recommend that for sure .",1
i dined in the jules verne restaurant .,1
our taxi driver said it would be less crowded later at night so we went back after dinner .,1
my wife and i both agree that it 's something we would never do again .,1
night visit is a must to see paris by lights .,1
as you would expect it 's busy .,1
we were there after 8 am and were in the vicinity until noon ... and the lines remained long .,1
"is was my second time to paris , and had only gone up at daytime .",1
"at night the tower will glitter after sundown on the hour , which is a site to see as well .",1
i was underwhelmed .,1
we were close to the front - about 30th in line .,1
"the lines seemed to get longer after we arrived but from arrival , 2 elevator lines up and plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the view , not to mention a champagne toast , we were on our way within two and a half hours !",1
"it 's one of those things you must do in your life , walk up the eiffel tower .",1
it is still worth it for the view .,1
"of course , you can not miss this paris spot , a must-see !",1
"our hotel was right down the street from here , so we got up early and walked around .",1
the eiffel tower is taller than you can even imagine and seeing it on tv does not give justice to its size and beauty !,1
viewing the tower from a distance is just as grand ... beautiful golden lights in the evening and she sparkles up at the top of every hour for 5 minutes .,1
"the surrounding neighborhood is full of hotels , shops , and cafes for your enjoyment .",1
la tour eiffel is one of the world 's great landmarks .,1
then you wait for the first elevator .,1
"we loved the experience , you hear about the tower all your life and now you get to experience it first hand .",1
less crowds too .,1
queue up .,1
"queue from the first to summit level -lrb- if you choose summit level -rrb- , it is well worth doing .",1
amazing views of the entire city .,1
the elevator takes you to the first level and the view was amazing .,1
"designed by gustave eiffel , the tower stands above gardens of the champs de mars worth the walk .",1
pay the extra and go to the top .,1
it was a pleasant experience wish i had done it sooner .,1
we visited the eiffel tower on a previous trip during the day and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves .,1
this trip we took the bus to the location and of course it was dark when we got there .,1
especially at night .,1
i was a little worried that the height might be an issue for me but i felt secure and was ok .,1
"if you purchase from the official website , the price is the same !",1
it is a beautiful structure to appreciate for sure .,1
"when my sister and 10-year old niece were in paris , we could not pass it by though .",1
one can enjoy to see this through tourist bus .,1
its the thing you have to do when in paris .,1
it was great the see most of the city at dusk .,1
we arrived around 11am -lrb- not ideal but had visited sainte chapelle first -rrb- after taking the metro to the trocadero station .,1
do n't miss it if you are in paris !,1
i ask someone to allow me to butt into line .,1
would do it again .,1
visited here as part of a surprise visit to paris with my husband .,1
"streets , food , weather everything was just great .",1
"58 tour eiffel has tables that overlook the trocadero , and it is worth the price/wait to sit there .",1
"after all , you ca n't visit paris and not see the eiffel tower .",1
so of course we had to take her to the eiffel tower .,1
take a slow tour around the tower and take in the spectacular views .,1
"climbing the stairs and taking the elevator to the top was a much more memorable experience than a tour would have been , so if you are choosing between one or the other , pick the first option !",1
"i was stunned by the view initially when i first saw it , it felt so surreal .",1
"we went to the first level for a champagne lunch at 58 tour eiffel , which was very good .",1
it is definitely worth the 17 euro cost - spectacular views of the city of lights !,1
our session ran late because one of the elevators was broken .,1
the group i was with -lrb- thirty to fifty years younger than i -rrb- flipped a coin to determine whether to see the eiffel tower .,1
the view from the top is beautiful .,1
you ca n't go to paris without going to the eiffel tower at least once .,1
the tickets are timed .,1
it looks majestic and is a really nice place to be .,1
while on the way down make sure to stop at the lower 2 levels to get a different perspective of the magnificent structure !!,1
if you are ready for a bit more of a windy experience then the summit is where to go .,1
+ romantic as my expectations !,1
firstly when getting off the coach we waited 30 mins for the toilet !,1
once up the tower we could n't get down !,1
"the lesson , book early if you can commit to the day and time .",1
very busy and a lot of street sellers but they did not really pester you - just a lot of them in one area .,1
it was an easy climb and our 5 and 7 year old walked up every step themselves .,1
its having an amazing view .,1
it was made on temporary basis and kept permanent ... not a joke .,1
we had booked the top of the tower on the eiffel tower site prior to leaving and were glad we did .,1
such huge lattice tower standing tall .,1
"getting to see it in person was magical , especially at night when the lights come on every hour on the hour .",1
at the top it is usually cool .,1
i enjoyed it .,1
the queues are awful - at any time of day - you ca n't avoid them .,1
we were lucky enough to go on a sunny day so visibility was awesome .,1
we were not able to book tickets online before our paris visit .,1
once in a lifetime experience .,1
"needless to say , if you want to go back down , there are new queues !",1
"the second floor view are great too , but the view from the top ca n't be beat .",1
have wanted to see the eiffel tower my whole life and was an amazing and breath taking experience seeing the tower ...,1
"in my opinion , it is not necessary to pay the addition euros to go all the way to the top .",1
make sure to take pictures from the top .,1
crowded of course .,1
you will have less stress and more time to look at it and the wait wo n't be as long .,1
i could n't stop taking pictures every time i saw it from every angle .,1
lots of queueing as expected for any major tourist attraction .,1
the eiffel tower was built for the 1889 world 's fair and was supposed to be destructed right after .,1
we walked the bridge and got a view from there which was bliss !,1
best booking in advance instead of paying on day,1
"was my dream to be in eiffel tower , just wonderful , amazing , a magnificent experience , i love it , is just perfect",1
our tour guide was very knowledgeable which really enhanced the experienced .,1
if you 're visiting at a busy time of year-which is probably year round-buy your tickets in advance so you wo n't be disappointed .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see for anyone visiting paris .,1
"you will be dizzy all day , but so worth it !",1
"beautiful day or night , always full with visitors , but also great big parks to lay down , have a bite of a crepe and observe the beauty of the tower .",1
a very romantic place .,1
so we decided to take the stairs .,1
"there are stalls , merry-go-round , souvenirs , champagne , strawberries all for sale around the vicinity .",1
once on top u get a breathtaking view of the entire city .,1
"see paris from a birds perspective , i would recommend booking before hand and avoiding the queues ; standing on the glass floor on the restaurant level is an experience .",1
yes to the very top !!,1
ensure you have an everlasting memory by kissing your love at the top .,1
"yea , a tourist trap but wonderful anyway .",1
come here at sunset/evening so you can see the view in sunset and then the tower lighted up in the evening .,1
"it is arguably the symbol of france , and it stirs emotions every time one sees it , no matter how often that is .",1
"so , because of horror stories of standing in line for hours on end , we decided to book the behind the scenes tour .",1
prices are good .,1
"do yourself a huge favor and go to the supermarket , pick up some bread , cheeses , fruit and a baguette , and find a sunny area to gaze at the eiffel tower while you enjoy your picnic .",1
"we went in november , in our first day we went here and decided to walk up the eiffel tower but being a little unfit we only made it to the first floor !!!",1
maximum time at the top is 45 minutes .,1
the eiffel tower is n't visible from everywhere as most people assume it is ... you have to be in a certain area to see it from afar .,1
the evening lights are good and can be enjoyed from outside .,1
i have been before and we did n't have to wait as long to get tickets .,1
we booked advance queue jump tickets to avoid queueing .,1
in 2012 we had a brief visit and marked it a 4 star .,1
they should not take so many people up if they ca n't manage .,1
if the flashing lights are on they look quite amazing .,1
you could buy tickets to walk up .,1
"when you come to see the real stuff , you will immediately know it is not overpraised .",1
we arrived mid-morning and bought a sandwich at a kiosk just beside the west entrance .,1
"really , the eiffel tower is all they say and more .",1
very rushed .,1
we took the lift to the first floor ... awesome experience .,1
had a glass of champagne at the top to celebrate but did n't try the restaurants .,1
if you purchased the summit -lrb- top -rrb- ticket then you have to wait another half hour to go up on the second elevator !,1
i was absolutely terrified because it was a lot higher than i thought it would be but it was well worth the fear .,1
loved all the inside stories about this iconic landmark .,1
beautiful from a far but also up close .,1
i revisited the tower after some 26 years - still a spectacular place to visit but incredibly busy .,1
"go at night , it 's less crowded .",1
"the tower has four feet , so pick a place to meet with your group in case you get separated .",1
i would recommend getting the lift if it 's raining anyway the steps can get very slippery .,1
those of us who climbed did get to the level for the elevator to the top sooner .,1
"at first , i was thinking just to take a photo at the eiffel but as soon as i 've seen the crowd .",1
we visited in the evening before it got dark with our 2 kids -lrb- 9 and 11 -rrb- so we were able to see the city before it got dark .,1
"there are many taller towers with better views , but the feeling on the top of this iconic tower is unbeatable .",1
the tower stands so tall and grand .,1
"however , as others have mentioned on their reviews , there was the usual very long queue of people when we came .",1
also very very filthy and a lot of people trying to sell you stuff illegally and the metro system is a nightmare until to ride it 5 or so times to get it down .,1
i climbed to the second level on the tower and the view is breathtaking .,1
"luckily nothing happened to us , but i became very edgy toward others .",1
"the only negative point is the queue , even with tourist passes etc , you have to wait .",1
had lunch at the 58 eiffel restaurant on the first level with lift ticket included to that level .,1
just one is sufficient .,1
i did not pay for going up to the 1st or 2nd levels .,1
incredible views from up the tower .,1
"50 sellers -rrb- hustle , but man they 're annoying !",1
i visited the eiffel tower in january so luckily for us it was t too busy although the queues were still a long wait .,1
"the view is fabulous , and they have a glass floor to walk on also .",1
had no idea paris was so big !,1
a bit expensive but worth it .,1
"if you take metro to there , you can get off in trocadero station to take photos .",1
book tickets ahead so you can cut down on your wait time !,1
"even in daylight , it was magnificent !",1
this was a bucket list item .,1
it was a really great evening and quite memorable .,1
be careful !!!,1
the downsides are the price and the long queues .,1
our hotel was closeby so we had several visits .,1
we decided to take his suggestion because the 2 lines on either side only merged to one elevator .,1
this place makes you fall in love .,1
we had sandwiches with us so we had a lunch/picnic on the 2nd level ; we sat on a bench and just enjoyed the view .,1
- `` which tower ? '',1
the boat cruse and the walks on the bridge was absolutely phenomenal .,1
would definitely come back again,1
"if you 're adventurous , you can still climb the 1,710-step to the top observation desk and avoid the long lines , or you can enjoy glass lifts which offer a panoramic view over the extraordinary architecture .",1
"stunning structure and taking the lift shows the old structure to its best as you can see the rivets , welding etc. .",1
"really worthwhile , but you need a head for heights and patience with the crowds .",1
"for a beautiful view at night , the best place to go is trocadero .",1
view from champ de mars good though .,1
"fantastic views and very informative , cinema , kids quiz , interactive displays etc. .",1
waited on line for about 45 minutes on a saturday night before giving up since it was so unexpectedly cold .,1
"the views on the second level are amazing , yes , but the views from the top are incredible and can not be described in words as you have to feel it to experience it .",1
my first thought of paris before i visited was the eiffel tower but after visiting paris for the first time not that impressed .,1
the eiffel tower is the iconic symbol of paris and can be seen from various areas .,1
i would recommend going up if you get a chance .,1
we went through the security lines which were fairly quick .,1
we went first thing in the morning to avoid long queues as did not book tickets on line,1
no need to pay extra to go to the top .,1
"did n't think we would go up the tower since we did n't have much time in the city and i had read how long the lines were , but it was misting rain when we got there and there were no crowds .",1
"we went here about 4pm , there were still plenty of people waiting to buy tickets and lining up .",1
like i said it 's a must see .,1
"although it 's not necessary , if you can time it to be there at sunset , it is even more beautiful .",1
just spend a day walking around the tower with my wife .,1
i suggest you go to the top and drink a glass of champagne .,1
"all tourist buses , metro and buses go to this area .",1
"expansive also , but the worst is really the staff .",1
we probably spent 20 minutes actually checking out the views from level 1 and 3 .,1
"must get the lift though , not the stairs , absolutely worth the extra couple of pounds as i saw a few puffed out people taking a breather on their walk up/down .",1
the view is beautiful from there .,1
must-see when you are in paris .,1
it 's much prettier and easier to appreciate from a distance .,1
"we visited here as a family of four -lrb- 2 adults and 2 children -rrb- and the first thing that pleasantly surprised me -lrb- ok , shocked me -rrb- was the price - we paid on the gate and it was far cheaper than we expected !",1
"of course if in paris , you must visit the eiffel towel , which is considered as a symbol of paris.up there , the atmosphere is amazing and gives you a full view of paris .",1
"on the second floor there was an hour que to get to the top , which was ok since we could view almost all of paris during the queuing :-rrb- i think we were at the top floor for five minutes , not that big difference from second floor when there are some clouds like it was in our case .",1
the queue to get in past security was an hour long .,1
it 's cool to have a coffee with the eiffel tower as a backdrop especially at night .,1
the view is unparalleled .,1
if you wait until you get there you will have to stand in long lines .,1
you have to see the eiffel tower !,1
plenty of street vendors selling eiffel stuff if that 's your thing !,1
you see the city of paris unfold before your eyes .,1
"the queues going to the top was terrible , i was able to get into the 2nd level of the tower .",1
visit time includes the long wait times for the lifts .,1
likely was the timing of our visit ... it was during the flood while the city was getting ready for euro 2016 .,1
"a lovers paradise , beautifully standing tall since years giving paris a different identity .",1
you can avoid this queue if u purchase tickets online .,1
"i can speak reasonable french which helped us out but most people were frustrated by the delays , lack of information and lack of staff , most of whom did n't understand anything that was said to them !",1
cant get enough of effiel tower .,1
went straight up in elevators - no lines-no waiting .,1
the problem is that there is always wind at the upper decks .,1
then we took the lift to the top to see the spectacular views of paris .,1
try to choose a warm day so you can linger for a snack and a drink !,1
"they are relentless , felt like i said ` no ' a hundred times .",1
one of the most famous structures in the world .,1
oh and it looks even better at night !,1
we got the lift up and then walked down to the first the floor - where there is a glass floor - kids loved looking down at the ant sized people .,1
"if in the city of lights , the eiffel is a must .",1
an obvious destination in paris and totally worth lining up to ride to the top for the amazing views of the city .,1
take a moment to absorb the experience of being there .,1
we could n't wait .,1
little souvenir shops to make sure you remember your special trip .,1
personally i prefer `` trucadero '' exit because of better view .,1
"staff very friendly , security thorougher but moved through the queue quickly .",1
beautiful at night too .,1
the tour is highly recommended .,1
"when we went last month , the upper floors of the tower was closed .",1
"go to the sommet , if you are afraid of heights conquer your fears its worth it !!!",1
you will not regret it unless you do n't do it !,1
my husband continuing to the top for even better views although it was windy and does sway .,1
it is an experience that rivals no other museum in the world .,1
the icing on the cake was at midnight when the tower lit up and the lights began to twinkle .,1
"buy your tickets way in advance because they sell out fast , or you have to pay more through a `` tour '' service .",1
this is a fabulous treasure .,1
has visited several times .,1
"always crowds , so you need to get there early .",1
overall i really enjoyed it despite the frustrations to get to the top .,1
try and walk over the bridge and walk back .,1
we took a guided tour which i do n't normally do but it meant we did n't miss anything and we really enjoyed the history and facts of the tower,1
it was really cool at 9 and 10pm when it twinkles .,1
friendly staff .,1
"few shady characters around the place selling stuff , well worth the visit",1
we had stopped at one of the many grocery stores nearby for some wine to take back to our room .,1
great views but terrible lines without a timed reservation .,1
"the best view , without street light distractions , is from the park side .",1
we missed on the online reservation .,1
the lines of course !,1
"especially , night vision mostly better than day .",1
trip to paris is not complete without a visit to eiffel tower .,1
get skip the line tickets ahead by buying tickets in advance as the lines can be quite long .,1
one starts appreciating the beauty a human can create .,1
then we went past the line and into the lifts without much delay at all .,1
i would definitely say it 's better during the evening time and although only walked up it during the day i can imagine on a clear evening the view is incredible .,1
"no visit to paris is complete without a visit to the tower obviously a clear day is best but even those whos time is limited , irrespective of the weather conditions , make the ride up for the fantastic views",1
the tickets were surprisingly cheap as i am under 25 and from the eu so i got a discount .,1
some people even pack their lunches so they do n't spend money at the cafe = plan ahead .,1
we saw ... we did n't wait in line .,1
me and hubby walked to the eiffel tower after a one hour walking and exploring around paris .,1
"we visited twice , once to see paris at night from the 2nd level and once in the morning from the top .",1
"we took the lift , and it 's probably advisable unless you like climbing lots of stairs .",1
it is amazing at night .,1
you have to reserve your ride for the visit to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
this is truly a bucket list experience .,1
"take the stairs-best way to avoid long waiting time in the queue , especially during peak season .",1
lit up and you can have fun picking out all the sights of the city of love ...,1
"besides the majestic presence of it 's existence from outside , it was a great experience to get to the top .",1
beware of pick pockets .,1
you had the choice of going up the steps or the elevator .,1
well worth the immense wait in line,1
do n't plan to picnic unless you want to be in the small corner park nearby .,1
best to go in the mid of the day as the waiting time is less then in the morning .,1
you 'll also be pleasantly surprised on the hour !,1
we walked all around and underneath .,1
crowded with as a diverse a group you 'll find any place in the world .,1
amazing view .,1
there was a waiting time of about 15 minutes to catch the lift down or you can take the stairs and descend .,1
incredible views across paris not to be missed !,1
same this visit !,1
amazing sight to behold .,1
i just thought it 's just a iron .,1
this visit was the twinkling lights every hour after dark .,1
i advise you to take a champagne flute on the tour eiffel it is very romantic and amazing place,1
"i was completely awe struck by its size , detail , and overall beauty .",1
"a must see on any trip , you just dont know how great a wonder it is until your standing next to it the park next door is a great area to get a selfie with the tower too .",1
please mention my name !,1
get here before it opens as the lines grow .,1
a must see if in paris .,1
we did do a `` skip the line : '' tour which we highly recommend too !,1
go in the early evening .,1
"loved the lights at night , too .",1
not sure why the police do n't move them on .,1
we recommend this to everyone .,1
the eiffel towel is lit with sparking lights on the hour for 5 minutes from dark until either midnight or 1:00 .,1
a tourist must-see but the barricades and lines may put some off .,1
"if you do not have time to queue to take the lift , which can take several hours including security , enter from the back of the tower -lrb- park side and not river seine side -rrb- and go through security and join the relative short queue to pay for the cheaper ticket and walk up the steps .",1
i will always remember the scene .,1
we got out with drinks for around $ 600 for 4 people .,1
apparently some guy named eiffel built it .,1
please beware that north american vs parisian month/day/year format differ .,1
i have heard so much about it from people who have visited there but to be there yourself is the most breathtaking moment for me .,1
taxi is still cheaper than the pedi-cab in general .,1
pre-purchase !!,1
constructed by gustave eiffel in 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 world 's fair .,1
we took the hop on/off bus by night and got fabulous photo 's of the eiffel tour lit up,1
there is a huge difference in the tower by day & night .,1
"hours passed , i mean hours to get to the top .",1
"after making it through the police gauntlet we went up the tower , enjoyed the view then came down to be assaulted by cheap street vendors selling all and any thing .",1
the other two levels are nice to walk around and enjoy as well .,1
"you queue for security , tickets , elevators - everything .",1
reasonably priced and absolutely delicious !,1
an absolute must when you visit paris for the first time .,1
for those wondering about when to arrive/what to expect for waiting times : we went on a sunny sunday in peak season and arrived at 8:40 am for a 9am opening time .,1
"we walked up to level 2 , spent hours enjoying the summit and a picturesque lunch .",1
"nevertheless , we went that day and got some great photos because it was not too crowded .",1
a stunning structure to view close up .,1
been twice .,1
just make sure you show up on the booked one slot .,1
"we went at 8:30 pm , lovely sunsets , lights aglow after 10pm .",1
"we to the south pole -lrb- hahaha , forget what they really called it -rrb- and waited about 10 minutes or less to buy tickets .",1
not sure why but you ca n't .,1
everything is great but the time one spends in the queue .,1
i got great pictures from every view .,1
only $ 17 per person to get to the top of this iconic monument is fantastic value .,1
there where a number of other customers looking refunds and the way we were spoke to was nothing short of a disgrace under the circumstances .,1
the lighted facade is fantastic and it twinkles on the hour - a sight not to be missed !,1
"on the advice of our french tour guide , we got online tickets to the second level and had great views even with a fog cover .",1
and light show during evening time is worth watching .,1
once you come down to any floor you can not go up again hence take you own time .,1
i love paris and the eiffel tower is the best place to visit in paris .,1
it was hard to get to the rails to look out in all directions .,1
we did n't end up going to the top because of the long lines - we go really good views of paris from the arc de triomphe and the sacre coeur basillica so we did n't feel like paying so much to wait in line for hours and see paris from up above .,1
that was nice .,1
be sure to take the pictures by the corousel where there is this guy who takes a beautiful snap for 10 # but worth it .,1
amazing experience and utilise the park to sit back and absorb this magnificent structure,1
"we had tickets to the 2nd floor views were good , but i think the views were better from the 1st floor .",1
this is probably the first thing you think when talking about paris .,1
the views were magnificent and it was n't too crowded at the top .,1
the eiffel tower by night and day seem like 2 different places .,1
i get it .,1
"the views were amazing , try the macarons they were the most elicit us we had while in paris .",1
lots to do and management is just superb !!!,1
"this was a good way to see the main highlights of paris with a small group , then we were dropped off at the base of the eiffel tower to proceed to eiffel 58 restaurant for lunch .",1
luckily the day we went was not overcast so we had a wonderful view from the tower .,1
there was an ice skating rink as it was christmas time .,1
instead personally i do n't see what all the fuss is about .,1
"we did n't want to go up the tower due to the heat and large lines that week , but for free you could gaze endlessly at the lights into the early morning .",1
i do not know whether i should call it a marvellous piece of structure or engineering or an art !!!,1
just take the famous picture in front of the tower and leave .,1
"just brilliant , anytime of the day or night .",1
eiffel tower is spectacular !!,1
we arrived mid morning and within 15 minutes had paid .,1
go to the top -- no point in being there and not doing that .,1
and eiffel tower made it spl .,1
"the crowds are not wrong , it is worth the time and the effort , not sure i 'd go beyond the first level",1
after purchase was amazed how quick security and on to lift .,1
the tour was about 1 1/2 hours cruising the river which was very nice and then we walked to the tower where we received our tickets for the tower .,1
top was magnificent ... very breezy the day we were there .,1
such a mind blowing experience - words can not express how beautiful it is .,1
we purchased tickets to the top but found the need to wait in a long line for the second time to make the rest of the trip up not worth it !,1
i had purchased the tickets a few months back to ensure we would have a reserved time and not to fight with the crowds .,1
beware of pickpockets especially at night as you will be approached with a lot of souvenirs to buy,1
"if you book online -lrb- stair entrance tickets are not sold online -rrb- and still end up queuing for the elevator , take the stairs .",1
my wife and i decided to not buy the tickets in advance because we did n't know what the weather would be like that day .,1
had pre-booked the ticket to the summit .,1
the line-ups can be long .,1
i was impressed as duck .,1
it is as advertised and romanticized .,1
"iconic building that says paris , france , immediately recognisable and when visited commands great views of paris and other major paris landmarks",1
"we did not go to the top , but did not really feel the need to .",1
we saw it from the hop on hop off bus .,1
"we walked out onto the glass floor , which is about halfway up , and i have to admit that i could n't look down.at night the tower lights up and on the hour the lights twinkle !",1
we went to the second level to take more photo 's before venturing to the top .,1
"i was pleased to find that the passageway up the steps was wide enough to permit faster climbers to ascend without being stuck behind me , and there was an exhibit of how the tower was built on every platform , so you could rest and read the exhibit if you wanted .",1
"cost $ 15 to go on the lift up , but i took the stairs which cost $ 3.50 .",1
haha indeed .,1
we were taken straight to the restaurant for a beautiful meal -lrb- silver service -rrb- with excellent wine .,1
the big negative is the long wait for the elevators .,1
take the time while in paris to see the tower at night ... if it 's cool outside the absolute best thing to do is go to the little trailer by the river and get a fresh made crepe ... every half hour the tour sparkles with lights and it is quite a sight !,1
"however , once at the top the views of paris are wonderful .",1
we had reservations at jules vern on the second floor .,1
visited in september .,1
you must get access to all three levels and i recommend going straight to the top and slowly making your way to the ground .,1
the eiffel tower was our first stop after dropping our bags off at the hotel .,1
excellent.such a must to visit when in paris .,1
"what can i say , its france 's icon .",1
but the there is one thing you ca n't see on the top of the eiffel tower - the tower itself .,1
great sense of achievment doing the 669 steps .,1
it took a return journey to get my husband up the tower and he is so glad he did .,1
just be sure to bundle up if you are planning on going to the top/outside viewing areas .,1
"we arrived just before sunset , so got to watch the landscape change and the lights of paris turn on .",1
the queues were quite small and the views from the second floor were amazing at night .,1
at the bottom ... beware of the street sellers trying to sell their wares who are very persistent .,1
the tickets for our kids -lrb- 16 and 20 -rrb- were $ 2 less on presentation of eu id for those aged from 16 to 24 .,1
we only went to the `` second floor '' which was perfect to see all of surrounding paris .,1
i recommend you book in advance if you can,1
it looks like no-one cares about this attraction at all and as if the french have given up caring for it .,1
"whatever said , it is the eiffel tower .",1
"i enjoyed the tower with my kids , and went to the top , beautiful views , with some lovely photos , an iconic building i had to see while there ,",1
we visited in early may .,1
go to the top and drink champagne for 17-20 + euros st the champagne bar .,1
we arrived in the morning and had to go through a security line that took about 40 minutes .,1
"so by the time my husband and son got to the eiffel tower around 9:30 , the security line was wrapped around the block , they waited online for 45mins to get in .",1
absolutely a must on a trip to paris .,1
what else to say that 's not already been said ?,1
lines can be long to go up so plan on being there awhile .,1
"at night the tower is lit up and it is spectacular , for the first 5-10 minutes each hour the tower sparkles and it is magical .",1
fabulous trip !,1
at the top you will have a 360 view of the whole city which will make a nice memory forever .,1
but you can order champagne on top !,1
"the most eminent site you should go to in paris , france is the eiffel tower .",1
"hi ,",1
always tried to buy your tickets by internet because if not you have to wait for a long time .,1
crowded but handled well .,1
"many spots to grab a picture of the eiffel tower , however my favorite spot would be to cross the bridge -lrb- pont d'léna -rrb- and continue onwards until you 're on the courtyard of the palais de chaillot .",1
- `` where did you go ?,1
"as long as you 're cautious and pay attention to your surroundings , you will have a wonderful trip",1
lots of people wanting signatures for a petition then money .,1
"one of the wonder of the world , excellent view from the tower in the day time and beautiful with the lighting from outside during night time however all good experience avoid travelling in the month of november and through tour agent",1
"because of the security stations , there are not mobs of people bugging you to buy their various `` goods '' .",1
full of pick pocketers .,1
great views across trocadero .,1
went today .,1
this was my second visit to the tower and i enjoyed it so much more this time .,1
but saying that there are a few characters around that warrant being aware of who is around you 。,1
"stopped briefly on the second floor where you must transfer to another elevator , then headed up to the top .",1
well i was not quite prepared for this impressive piece of work .,1
"it also avoids the larger queues on the ground , you then have to get the lift to the top but the wait time to buy a ticket was only a few minutes as most people have bought a ticket on the ground .",1
not enjoyable .,1
so be there early if you do n't want to stuck in the long que .,1
"if you take the 10:00 tour at night , be aware that the upper deck is closed and you ca n't get tickets to the top .",1
that said the views from the tower are amazing .,1
pick any time of the day for the day view .,1
"gets colder further up you go , so perhaps a light jacket or fleecy .",1
it 's crowded so you have to be a little careful .,1
do this straigh form eiffel tower website - not from expensive tourproviders .,1
"not a highlight of the trip , but at least i gave it a try .",1
"been there a few times now , always worth a visit when you 're in the area .",1
if you visit at night you can walk right underneath it an amazing sight .,1
exhilarating memories of the parisian visit,1
the symbol of france and simply a beautiful landmark !,1
have been to paris multiple times and it never fails to thrill .,1
"my wife and i arrived with friends early morning and the line were already long , and we took about 45 minutes to get to the lifts .",1
best advice is to check out the weather before .,1
the ...,1
this was my first trip since the new security measures are in place .,1
after reading and doing our homework we got there early and the line was only about 20 minutes .,1
but it still looked amazing .,1
the views were gorgeous of course !,1
they do not open before 9:30 am .,1
"we missed it due to travel time , but feel we arrived at a great time .",1
at night it twinkles on the hour and i could never get enough of it .,1
such sight to see ... a must see .,1
paris access does not cover the entry to the tower .,1
we encountered 3 different people who were among the worst we 've met in paris over 4 days .,1
do n't miss fat tire 's terrific tour !,1
so off we went to the metro .,1
"and the views from the top again could be better from some other structures worldwide but how could they beat the fact that , it is paris that you see from the top .",1
"be prepared for large crowds , lots of security and pick pockets .",1
"we did n't go up , as we 'd chosen to go up the montparnasse tower -lrb- separate review -rrb- which i highly recommend .",1
it 's so beautiful and serene .,1
another good evening .,1
it 's an iconic spot and always a joy to capture photo memories there .,1
the eiffel tower is incredible beyond words .,1
went here at night time as we were not organised enough to book tickets in advance !,1
"it 's absolutely gargantuan which you really ca n't understand just looking at pictures and its quite a bit more beautiful in person too - in photos , it looks like a dull , boring gray color but it 's actually a gleaming light brownish-gray with names etched into a little part on the backside -lrb- i think they 're the names of builders who helped with the tower but i 'm not sure -rrb- of the tower .",1
we were able to enjoy both the broad day light view as well as the night view .,1
i love to see the whole city from top snd while lift goes top from ground slowly .,1
no trip to paris is complete without a trip up its iconic landmark .,1
this is the customary thing for every tourist who visits paris .,1
at night it is a great sight to see the lights playing and flashing .,1
got to meet some lovely people though from india .,1
views were great and worth the price .,1
"i had been to paris once before but only got to see the tower , not go up it .",1
i had the best time ever .,1
"the eiffel tower is a must , weather was not great the day we visited but still had good views .",1
"to my delight , once i returned home , expedia apparently included a refund should you not attend .",1
we visited right after sunset and were at the top when the city of lights came to life .,1
it 's one of those structures that you ca n't help but be amazed with no matter how many times you 've seen it .,1
we were lucky enough to book a private tour up the eiffel tower .,1
i go there at least once every time i spend some time in the city .,1
make sure you have a reservation or you will chance not getting in there at all .,1
a lights display appears on the hour every hour when it 's dark .,1
we were able to get a view of the city both in the daylight and night .,1
we were able to see the light show and it was romantic and entertaining at the same time .,1
wear walking shoes for comfort and safety .,1
the views are stunning from there .,1
"my husband and i did n't make it to see it in the day , but we believe the night view of the tower would definitely prevail .",1
i hopped on the b train to the notre dame stop .,1
the views are just amazing and breathtaking and you can take as long as you like wandering around to take it all in .,1
"the eiffel tower looms above the city skyline and your view is excellent from the water , especially at night .",1
but overall it 's beautiful !,1
definitely worth it if it 's your first time in paris .,1
we took a chance and it worked out .,1
it is just like any other tower in the world .,1
"it is just fun to look for the many paris landmarks , such as the louvre , notre dame and the arch de triumphe .",1
"if weather is cold , do wear warm clothes as the wind is a pretty strong on the second floor while queuing for tickets and if you want to stay outdoors longer on the summit , you need warm clothes .",1
"i am not sure why exactly , maybe it is the history , maybe it was the champagne at the top , but even though it was busy it was a great experience .",1
"it is quite a sight to lay in bed at night and see the eiffel tower , with its beautiful lights out of the window .",1
"took the concierge tour and it was good , katrina was very informative and we learned alot about the tower .",1
everything you expect it will be .,1
like going to the pyramids in egypt .,1
the guided tour was the way to go to see the tower .,1
super : avoid the queues and go up the stairs - its not that difficult and the views are fantastic .,1
loved visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"the steps up the eiffel tower are deadly , it was a hot day and i thought that i was n't going to make it , but that last few steps are the best .",1
when i was there it was cold and windy .,1
"if you can get tickets for the evening , a sunset from the tower is a real treat too .",1
the best views are from a distance .,1
my last visit .,1
i ca n't seem to keep my eyes off of it .,1
no words can describe the feeling of being there .,1
"on this , my second visit to the eiffle tower , i discovered the child friendly garden and playground which was very much appreciated by my grandchildren , aged 7 and 4 .",1
but smell like piss .,1
we took a tour to the second floor with the option of going to the top .,1
sadly we lost a bottle of red wine to the baggage checkers as no alcohol is allowed up the tower .,1
no trip to paris is complete without taking in the view from the top .,1
we took the metro and walked over .,1
can be extremely crowded and need to keep 3-4 hours if planning to go to the top .,1
once you r tour is over you can travel on your own .,1
this is something you 'd do to be able to say you 've done it .,1
very crowded but beautiful none-the-less .,1
when we arrived at the eiffel tower were queues that exceeded three hours wait .,1
"as i started walking towards it , the anticipation only increased , as the beauty of eiffel came into full view with all the minute details about how humongous it really is .",1
"we walked up as it was quicker than waiting for the lift , and cheaper .",1
"and they sell quickly , as in all of them for the particular day in less then 10 minutes during the summer rush .",1
"otherwise , you will have to book an expensive combination tour to get in .",1
this option costs 7 euros .,1
only on a good day i would say .,1
queues are less during winter so it makes a good time to go .,1
if you are going to the eiffel tower please plan ahead .,1
the view at night is amazing,1
we stayed till midnight and ended up having to take the elevator down .,1
there was no queue at this gate .,1
"if you buy both 2nd and 1th floor access , you will be going to 2nd floor first .",1
the views of paris were spectacular !,1
we enjoyed our tour very much .,1
"if you have not purchased tickets ahead of time , the line up goes on forever !",1
we arrived around 0745 for the 0900 opening and bought tickets to the summit .,1
read through the history of the eiffel tower and enjoy it 's magnificence twice - once during the day at close quarters and second at night .,1
wonderful going into history .,1
you will always find a crowd taking photos with the tower in the backdrop .,1
crowded but expected .,1
"we just wanted to enjoy the tower , leave us alone !",1
"the views are amazing and the slight swaying reminds one how high you are above the beautiful , breathtaking city of paris .",1
"she actually gave the tour in three languages : english , spanish , and french .",1
"it took a lot of time to get to the top of tower , but it was worth of it .",1
amazing creative of a man.what a place to visit we really enjoyed.nice view from top of the tower amazing .,1
"i 'm glad i saw it , i just wish i viewed it from a different neighborhood !",1
"take a coat , it can get windy up there !",1
i think the only words that can describe this place is wow .,1
make sure you go during the day and in the evening when it is all lit up .,1
i highly recommend not talking or associating with those people .,1
we booked our tickets online through the france tourisme website so we skipped the huge line .,1
i want to share one incident happened near to eiffel .,1
our guide was very energetic and full of interesting info .,1
the tower is actually brown not black .,1
loved the views,1
my kids loved to eiffel tower with 4 days in paris we visited 3 days .,1
the trip to the top of the eiffel tower is worth the wait .,1
because it seems small and colorless .,1
go up to the top .,1
gutted i did n't get any pics of it lit up,1
try to get there in a sunny nice spring day and you will feel the beauty of one of the most wonderful cities .,1
the tower itself is a beauty and either taking pictures around it or going up is wonderful .,1
man !,1
there is however a queue again to go from the 2nd floor to the 3rd floor so be prepared to wait in line there .,1
it was a pleasure to get to see what once was the tallest building in the world .,1
this was a girls trip and we booked a boat and eiffel tour .,1
the eiffel is a bit industrial looking but is still a lot of fun .,1
this is the iconic symbol of paris .,1
i saw this big tower and a bunch of people standing in line so decided to check it out .,1
"we were not disappointed to see it in real life , especially when it was lit up around 10 p.m. something we 'll never forget .",1
it is a must see when you go there .,1
i usually visit the same places but always stay at different apartments but every time i go i have to visit the eiffel tower .,1
for our visit to the eiffel tower we decided to book `` jump the queue '' 3 course lunch at 58 restaurant on the 1st floor .,1
do n't missed it,1
everyone sees the eiffel tower during the day .,1
however this was n't the case when we went on wednesday or when we came out .,1
we did dinner at the 58 restaurant which was a nice treat -lrb- it does require reservations -rrb- .,1
long waiting time to get up but definetly worth it !!!!,1
"best to reserve tickets in advance , otherwise you 'll wait about 30 minutes in line to pass through the security check .",1
i went to the second level and i took some good pictures .,1
"the queing was very long , be prepared to wait for over an hour to get up the elevator up to the second floor .",1
highly recommended but beware of the ques !!!,1
what is there to say about eiffel .,1
just do n't try to do it in a rush !,1
"we tired the macaroons and champagne , which was expensive , but a once in a lifetime experience .",1
we stayed out late to see the evening light display at the top of each hour after dark .,1
i had always put the eiffel tower in the same category i had placed hawaii - over commercialized and lacked the awesomeness .,1
you can not come to paris without seeing the eiffel tower .,1
tick .,1
amazing view from the top ... went with my husband ... looks amazing when the lights are up ... .,1
"however , clearly my impression has changed .",1
good was delicious and well worth it .,1
eiffel tower is synonymous to paris !,1
"i wo n't bother next time i 'm in paris , but everyone should visit it once .",1
its a must see place and worth the waiting in the long ques,1
no one goes to paris without seeing the eiffel tower .,1
"great , a real must see .",1
bad neighborhood though and lots of shady characters .,1
walked down to the glass floor area which was an experience though by day it 's probably more fun or scarier !,1
it was so big and beautiful .,1
the view from my room is amazing .,1
security was surprisingly light .,1
the view from the summit/top floor is breath taking .,1
"indeed , the view from along the sienne from the allee des cygnes is just beautiful , much more romantic , and no people or shops !",1
we decided to save money and took the stairs up .,1
try to get a ticket ahead .,1
just loved it when it started to sparkle .,1
this is still a magnificent highlight of any paris visit .,1
loved the tower of course but appalled by the crazy young crowd throwing beer bottles in the park and too many vendors trying to sell cheap souvenirs .,1
if i get a chance i 'll definitely going back !,1
it 's beautiful in all its forms and glory :-rrb-,1
"the city of paris and the eiffel tower are symbolic of each other , before my visit , i had high expectations of the city and the monument itself from what i 've heard , but at the same time worried that the higher the expections , the greater the letdown .",1
go to second level and drink a glass prosseco in restaurant !,1
after you get to the second floor you can buy a ticket to get into the elevator which then takes you to the top .,1
i was n't disappointed .,1
this was a 3 course meal with an alcoholic drink and tea/coffee bought for us as a christmas present for our stay in paris in january .,1
"i took the stairs , just because i did n't want to wait to get the elevator , and it 's quite tiring , but worth seeing .",1
"everyone offers a `` hop the line '' for the tower at hotels , i did n't know what they meant , we call it `` jumping the queue '' in british english .",1
also it was a great experience to bring a picnic and sit in the garden across the road to take it all in !,1
it 's windy at the top -lrb- of course -rrb- .,1
"it was so crowded , but we were so little .",1
beautiful views of a beautiful city .,1
we went in december and did n't have to wait on any lines with reserved tickets .,1
it gives you a different perspective .,1
go up all the way to the top and soak up paris in all of its beauty .,1
"fyi , it 's not heavily guarded at night if you 're worried about the risk of terror attacks .",1
went at night at 10pm .,1
some people still think the eiffel is a blight on the landscape !,1
"but the combination of views , climbing the stairs , architectural interest and lights made it totally memorable .",1
specially when you the tower lightining behind you is just a feast to your eyes .,1
make sure you go at night .,1
of course there was the standard people selling things but the strangest thing was wine .,1
my wife bought tickets via a private operator as all pre booked tickets with the eiffel tower were sold .,1
must see !,1
we loved our stay in paris & visiting the eiffel tower was surely one of the high lights ... it 's impressive - day & night ...,1
it stands tall in the middle of paris and can be seen from most parts of paris .,1
however this was the end of the summer season so very busy .,1
do n't leave it too late and do n't linger on the 2nd floor before going to the summit .,1
great tour .,1
visited thru a tour company .,1
"as teens checked her out , a guard alerted her .",1
if you want to go to the top make sure to check on what time the last elevator goes up .,1
if you want to climb the stairs you will not have to wait very long at all .,1
do n't even think about standing in line your base tickets .,1
the view is amazing and preferable to the bir-hakeim route that we took the next evening .,1
"we did n't take the staircase up higher because my knee was giving me problems , but sure would have loved to go higher .",1
the ticket availability online is also very dubious .,1
we went with a tour group so only got to the 1st and 2nd level .,1
the tour is a commercial tourist site with none of the above .,1
the restaurant on the 2nd level requires reservations -lrb- call or you may book on-line .,1
pictures attached .,1
it is truly an awe inspiring sight .,1
it is especially beautiful lit up at night .,1
"will do it again the vip was quick and was n't too crowded , it was worth the extra payment .",1
go towards the end of the day so you 're there for the lights at night .,1
"we never saw it at night all lit up but its great just seeing it full stop , the queues are ridiculous to get into the lifts or to buy tickets .",1
how can you go to paris and not stop to see the eiffel tower beautiful sight to see another item checked off the bucket list .,1
though i missed the night show but still it was a great experience .,1
worth the visit to see it in real life .,1
"there was no waiting , we skipped the queue .",1
both my husband and i were online and we got tickets to the 2nd level - did not get tickets to the top .,1
i read that it is 669 steps .,1
"whether you are just walking underneath or going all the way up to the top , it is a must see attraction .",1
it is a sight to see !,1
views are amazing and we came back in the evening for the sparkly lights which is also a must as the atmosphere is second to none .,1
we traveled there on august so the place was extremely crowded .,1
"it 's an impressive feat of engineering , and beautifully designed .",1
"an absolute must-see in paris , but the view from the top is even more impressive !",1
then expect to que again to get your lift ticket to the top .,1
the fee is only to go up the tower .,1
"this is worth the $ and a wait , but do yourself a favor and order tix as soon as you know you 're going .",1
do n't forget to go to the top .,1
"it was a rainy day and the lines were long , even with tickets .",1
there is a lot of security for the moment in all the city including tower .,1
this was one of my grandson 's favorite attractions .,1
i love the magnificent structure & the surrounding grounds .,1
"the view from the top is amazing , such an awesome site during and night .",1
we went online to find out what time sunset was and booked for sunset .,1
its seen from everywhere and great to get your bearings .,1
go right to the top you wo n't be sorry .,1
the views were amazing though .,1
we purchased tickets for a guided tour and thus managed to avoid the long queues which was handy !,1
"whether you ride the elevators to the top or just stand outside the perimeter for a photo , it is well worth your time .",1
views are amazing from middle top and underneath .,1
"so do n't bother taking a long line , take your time and enjoy the tower from the ground .",1
lovely views good value gift shops beware pick pockets !,1
i was able to purchase tickets to eiffel tower summit and a tour before i left home and it made the visit that much more enjoyable .,1
try to go on a clear day .,1
"an amazing experience , and a total must if you 're in paris .",1
try and get to the top if you can - you can get tickets for the top once you arrive at the 2nd floor .,1
"it is iconic , exciting , and nostalgic ... all in one .",1
"from a far was lovely to see , however the prices to go up were n't available , long waits .",1
we bought a fast pass/tour and were glad to be able to skip the lines and get up to the second floor .,1
we went up on our first day in paris and could n't be happier !,1
also pickpockets do operate there despite police on the lookout so do mind your wallet .,1
second level was high enough to see all around .,1
we chose to go to the top .,1
i personaly had doubts weather i get up or not because i 'm afraid of heights .,1
though overcrowded but visit can not be completed till you see it .,1
this year we were able to see the tower from a river boat tour at night and it was just beautiful .,1
one of the best views in paris !,1
a must see monument when you visit france .,1
we rode the batobus to the tower and caught the metro back .,1
get a ticket to the top online before you get there or get it when you get there but be prepared for crowds .,1
if you are handicapped you will be able to cut the long line .,1
"great view of the city , middle level is totally enough .",1
the tower is an amazing experience and one that should not be missed when in paris .,1
a simply majestic landmark which will leave you in awe .,1
watch your bags closely though !,1
"the rest of the time was spent in the ticket queue , then the various elevator queues , both up and down .",1
take a river cruise to experience the city from another perspective .,1
they mislead their customers into believing that you do not have to wait in line .,1
"the best view is from the second floor , so do n't pay extra to go to the very top .",1
we even got to see it sparkle this happens every hour until 1am for 5 minutes .,1
the first floor cafe serves lovely fresh prexls,1
ofcourse now more security checks etc compared to last time .,1
amazing to walk around and under the tower .,1
"for the second time coming to paris , it 's still magical to be here !!",1
"you do have to go through security checks before entry but that seems the norm at most places these days , you can walk up or take the elevator , my husband and i took the elevator up and walked down which was good .",1
the crowds are outrageous and all the gating and fencing obstruct the flow and interrupt the experience .,1
do n't miss the light show on the tower at the top of every hour .,1
keep your personal possessions close at hand .,1
they held up a board with prices and told us it was $ 20 .,1
you can not miss this iconic destination in paris .,1
we could n't keep up !,1
"you share the joy of everybody once the lights start twinkling , from the gasp and then the awe and the joy of everyone watching the show .",1
if you are in paris you must visit the eiffel tower at least once !,1
"no crowds , elevator trip was worth it to the restaurant.the eiffle night lit up the eiffle towers with blinking lights by the hour .",1
definitely worth it !,1
the best location to take photos of the eiffel tower is tracedero .,1
but it 's very very very pretty and the light show at night is so pretty and romantic you can see it from almost anywhere in central paris !!,1
"it is very touristy , of course , but well worth the trip up .",1
comforting to see 3 armed soldiers patrolling the tower .,1
"the lights were on by 9 p.m i guess , but the sun had not set yet .",1
great experience - quite a work out climbing all the way up -lrb- as far as you can anyway -rrb- .,1
it is a really spectacular at night when it is lighted .,1
a visit to the eiffel tower is a must in paris .,1
"we rented bikes and rode alone the river , but it 's hard to find parking dock near the attraction .",1
weather dependent and pre-booking not essential .,1
we accidentally came across a lovely view by walking to the eiffel tower via rue l'universite .,1
many e-taxi or e-rickshaw pullers are operating in this area .,1
"best time to view the tower was at night , when it sparkles !",1
"there are far too many people allowed up at any one time in my opinion , and the structure clearly wasnt built with this volume of traffic in mind .",1
"of course this is the place not to miss in paris ... the view is outstanding but usually there are lots of people , whether when at the ground level or when you want to go to level 3 ... i would recommend buying the tickets online ahead of time ... you won t need to wait in order to buy the tickets ... it s also nice to be around the tower around the time it is lighten ... it s amazing ... had great memories there",1
tips .,1
you do have to queue a second time halfway up the tower in order to get the lift to the top .,1
in summer the sky turns dark really late .,1
excellent views from the top ; still a very impressive tourist attraction and well worth braving the queues,1
worth climbing it and eat on the restaurent on top .,1
a must do for all tourists in paris .,1
unfortunately the top of the tower was closed due to frost but we still enjoyed visiting .,1
a warning my husband was pick pocketed someone stole his cellphone at the summit !,1
"the queue was a little long and the trip up by stairs is not for the faint-hearted but it makes you feel better for eating all that buttery , delicious french food in the city !",1
there is lots of space all around the tower so you do n't feel crammed in like a tourist and can appreciate it 's beauty at your own leisure quite freely .,1
one word ... sparkling !,1
"café in the tower was clean and appealing , prices were not as expensive as i thought they might be .",1
"it 's the eiffel tower , what can i say ?!",1
my 6 year old son and i climbed the second floor to see the city and its a terrific experience !,1
the eiffel tower really is a must-see in paris !,1
maybe i should visit in the sun sometime !!,1
"the lights twinkled , the views were breathtaking and the light show completed the picture .",1
try to visit on the week days .,1
we went at night around 9:30 pm there was a small crowd .,1
"being here only 3 weeks after the paris attacks there is not many tourists so we queued for about 10 mins to get tickets to walk to the second level platform then got the lift , great views from the top .",1
was n't a great day to visit -lrb- cold and rainy -rrb- but it was great experience to make the trek to see the tower .,1
very tricky and annoying souvenir sellers .,1
this place is amazing but be aware of the vendors which will try to loot you by selling you expensive souvenirs which are not worth it .,1
"it seems that no matter what time of the year you go , you still have to line up for a minimum of an hour , however when you do finally make it , it is well worth the waitm",1
"the views were amazing , despite it being a rather foggy day .",1
"it was also absolutely freezing , so it pays to dress warmly .",1
so that 's why i have only given it 4 stars instead of 5 .,1
here is what to expect .,1
it also means choosing a day that may not be the most conducive to visit .,1
would highly recommend !,1
breathtaking !!,1
all lit up and looking beautiful .,1
keep your wallet hidden .,1
we then joined a queue which went right across the square and down the side of a building .,1
though touts sell cheap wines .,1
"you must go on your first day in paris , and wait in line to go up ... its nice to go up on the end of the day , where you can see the view during the day , and wait a little to see the city light up",1
"goes without saying this is a must see attraction in paris , but the day we went the tourist crowds were so big it really was hard to enjoy .",1
"if you have unlimited time to spend with all the other tourists for the ascent , and have to check this off the list of things you 've done , then have at it .",1
everything i thought it would be .,1
another benefit is you avoid the interminable queues for the lift .,1
we did n't go in as by the time we got there the queue was very long and we had a planer to catch in a few hours .,1
anyway an obvious must visit .,1
a must see experience !,1
it is only 4 euros to take the steps !,1
tip for travelers : do take a guide,1
seeing the tour eiffel up close is quite an experience .,1
"the eiffel tower is on the outskirts of the city in open park area , we used the tour bus",1
too many tourist on top of the tower to propose their girlfriends as well .,1
"during the day the views are better from the top i feel , but at night the tower itself lights up and becomes a piece of artwork to be admired .",1
"you can walk round the tower and view the city from north , south , east and west .",1
no visit to the tower is complete without going right to the top .,1
we are senior travelers and wanted to climb the steps at least once more .,1
it was absolutely unforgettable .,1
and my thighs had the work out of their lives .,1
it 's inspiring from any distance ...,1
we have visited paris before however never fancied the queues outside the tower .,1
what more should be written about a monument that defines paris :-rrb- inly advice is that try to book in advance if you wish to go up to the top and enjoy the breathtaking view of the most romantic city,1
"if i have more time in paris , i 'll try to challenge climbing up to the first level and then take lift to the top .",1
an extra fee is charged to go to the top of the tower .,1
"it 's a must see , but be prepared for lots of street workers to get you to buy their mini eiffel towers , the streets are flooded with them trying to get you to buy their product .",1
bucket list visit for my wife on her 60th birthday to le jules verne restaurant at the top of the eiffel tower .,1
"we did , and had a fabulous trip to the top .",1
if you go during the high season i 'd definitely buy tickets in advance to avoid long lines .,1
"as my family walked up to the tower admiring it 's beauty and majesty , we were constantly asked to buy towers , sign petitions -lrb- that we were told after signing we needed to donate something -rrb- , or just hounded for pics for money .",1
the day time views are wonderful .,1
"the eiffel tower is obviously iconic to look at from outside , but going inside truly is amazing .",1
as anticipated the tower is fantastic .,1
i went to the 2nd level and my husband went to the summit .,1
"the view is pretty outstanding from the second level and if you are lucky enough to go with a guided tour , you will be able to have all the cool places around paris pointed out to you .",1
"a panoramic view of the city , the problem is the long queues .",1
the structure itself is simply beautiful and the views on offer of paris are breathtaking .,1
great day out and very reasonably priced in a fairly expensive city .,1
well worth it !,1
its a safe place even at midnight .,1
i had just one spare day during my disneyland paris half marathon weekend to get into central paris to see some of their famous landmarks .,1
the lifts up and very sturdy .,1
"nice to see once a time , but not important to get up in it .",1
i read some time ago about arriving to see the eiffel tour by arriving at trocadero metro station - and this is the surprise i sprung on our friends .,1
we booked this with a tour guide ok you pay a bit more but it is worth it .,1
"we made reservations with a tour , so we did not have to wait in line .",1
just buy your tickets online to avoid the long waiting time to buy tickets on site .,1
i really thought it would be bigger seeing it in movies - side so many scam artist tryed getting me and my wife signatures for fake charities,1
it far exceeded my expectations .,1
loved it !!,1
stunning views for sunset .,1
make sure to spend some time underneath the tower .,1
went with adult daughter studying abroad .,1
"be aware of your surroundings , everyone warns of pick pockets .",1
"even in shoulder season the crowds are oppressive , taking the edge off what should be a glorious sight .",1
"by all means , do visit and enjoy .",1
loved the look but for those of us that are afraid of heights like myself not so great but still can admire from outside .,1
very crowded so plan on being there awhile .,1
the structure is a photographers dream .,1
"every hour on the hour it not only shines , it sparkles like a jewel for several minutes , it 's a breathtaking sight .",1
we went at 8:30 -lrb- it opens at 9:30 -rrb- .,1
this will give you the chance to see what it really looks like in detail and take great photos .,1
we had a great time and enjoyed the view !,1
"despite the many beautiful sights we saw in paris , this was still the highlight of our trip .",1
"had a great tour at night with lots of information , skipping queues , and then to see it lit up was an unforgettable sight .",1
"but anyway , so many people selling stuffs here and there and the surrounding area is a bit dirty .",1
everyone should visit this place at least once in lifetime !,1
when we arrived back in paris after our bus tour of france we spent around 2 hours at the eiffel tower .,1
there is security to go through before you can buy a ticket .,1
great views and a fab experience,1
there are two lunch options one at noon and the other at 2 pm .,1
"you can get a snack or souvenir , then walk or take the elevator to the first level .",1
we were around 7 euro .,1
"incidentally , this window only took cash for tickets .",1
went right to the top with our pre booked tickets which were a must in order to beat the queues and make the most of your time in paris .,1
enjoyed with 2 teens and a 10 year .,1
my first time to visit eiffel tower was by day .,1
"the real treat is a return visit at night for the eiffel tower light show with the tower festooned with a europa cup globe situated beneath the first platform , the were a variety of color schemes displayed on the tower .",1
this is a must !!,1
"seeing is believing , seeing is unbelievable !",1
"having said this , the tower remains a must see",1
- a lot of guys sells some wines bottles !,1
a special moment indeed !,1
me and my husband visited the eiffel tower in june 2016 and it 's just amazing .,1
"my advice would be to choose wisely when you visit since it is crowded and taking pictures become difficult ... wonderful place , easily accessible by metro , avoid traveling by car or anything on the road , much traffic jam in paris !",1
"what a structure , it 's simply gorgeous .",1
we went both during the day and at night .,1
avoid the long lines by hiring a tour guide -lrb- such as thyago with viator -rrb- .,1
i feel that the eiffel tower is most hyped attraction .,1
the park in front of the tower is beautiful .,1
no trip to paris is complete without visiting the unbelievable eiffel tower both during the daytime and again at night when it is lit up .,1
the view from the top is breathtaking .,1
"you do have to wait for the lifts going up and down levels and to the ground , but that is to be expected .",1
the view up there was magnificent toward the city and down to the ground .,1
this is one of the most incredible landmarks i have ever seen !!,1
the eiffel tower is a must visit .,1
the whole thing is a kind of rip-off and there are many other locations in town from where you have a better view on the city,1
"we 've all seen photos of the tower and it is synonymous with paris , but to see it in person is another matter entirely .",1
"each corner of the eiffel tower has a ticket office , 2 are for people willing to walk up and the other two are for people who want to take the lift , we took the lift and walked down as there are attractions on the way down like , museums , shops , cafe 's , and an ice rink .",1
we spent a good 3 hours here and could have spent longer .,1
so beautifully lighted up at night .,1
"paris is magical , definitely be back .",1
the ticket to the 3rd floor was 6 euros or around $ 7 .,1
"we visited paris for the day while staying elsewhere in the locality , we queued for what felt like eternity , to finally get up to the tower , it was 35degrees in paris that day so being crammed like sardines was s little harsh on the platform of the tower , we decided against a further 2 hr wait to get to the top and instead walked around the beautiful city instead",1
be prepared to queue as security is now very tight .,1
personally i recommend reserving a ticket online .,1
there is a free skating rink on the first level at the moment too .,1
"there is a restaurant , gift shop , and everything up there .",1
amazing views at night .,1
it takes around 2-3 hours to enjoy it fully .,1
:-rrb- 1 more thing off the bucket list !!,1
"the eiffel tower is to paris what the statue of liberty is to new york , or opera house is to sydney australia .",1
a good park to walk around -lrb- although vendors do pester you -rrb- and you can get a crepe around the park area as well .,1
the view is spectacular at night especially when it ` sparkles ' every hour in the evening .,1
it is stunning at night especially when the twinkling lights go on .,1
once you leave the tower there are other free things to do in the park area .,1
ah yes ... the eiffel tower !,1
i had been to paris maybe 30 years ago and had forgotten how majestic the eiffel tower really is .,1
"well , came across this by ` accident ' whilst walking around paris trying to get my bearings on my first day there .",1
the elfel toweris one of the most popular sights to see as a tourist but worth it .,1
the entire paris smell like piss unfortunately .,1
there is a carousel in the area too .,1
"you wonder about the people who worked on it , the inventions that made it possible , the historical moment in which it took place .",1
"once you get to the summit , the view is amazing .",1
this will cost you 5 euros and burn some calories that you can later expend on crêpes .,1
to drive to the top is very expensive and only recommendable for those who want to have seen it once .,1
omg spectacular !!,1
beautiful both at day and at evening .,1
one of its archs was the main entrance of the world exhibition of 1889 .,1
if you desired a trip to the top the tickets can be purchased as this level .,1
"there are many people selling things too , which is very annoying because there are no police nearby and when they do come , they run away and do n't get caught so they come back .",1
"i 'm so glad we were n't able to just buy the admission tickets on our own - the structure is huge and i would n't have had any idea which entrance to go to , there were long lines to get in which we passed , and generally it was worth the extra money to have someone lead us to exactly where we needed to be and provide commentary and guidance throughout the whole visit .",1
we did n't do alot of the touristy things in paris .,1
we gave up waiting and ended up just walking through paris .,1
fantastic view from the top and well worth it !,1
"loved this visit , we bought beat the queue tickets as previously waited over an hour .",1
"then to make matters worse , we found out at the second level that we needed new tickets to get to the top !",1
many say that the view from the top is not as good as the view from the 2nd stage .,1
this is not a romantic place but nice trip to see the views .,1
spent almost 1 1/2 hours in the tower itself looking out on all three levels and walking down from the second level .,1
security and crowds slow down entrance to structure .,1
the security line moves relatively fast ... and it 's free to go in .,1
first a long que for ticket then for liift for up .,1
a fantastic view .,1
the visio of paris in the climb espectacular .,1
"we sat in the jardins du trocadero at 10pm and watched the stunning light show on the tower , absolutely stunning .",1
"the security gate actually opens at 9 , ticket booths open at 9:30 am .",1
just be aware of the pickpockets .,1
"once at level 2 we waited another hour to buy the 6 eur ticket to the top but it was fairly quiet when we did get to the top , which helped my vertigo as , unlike last time , i did n't spend the whole time thinking the 100 + year old tower would collapse under the stupid number of people they cram in there -lrb- about 20,000 everyday ! -rrb-",1
so if you only have a short time visit somewhere else .,1
do the stairs to avoid queuing .,1
"we are going to do the louvre another day , when we have more time .",1
"we loved our visit to this icon , we sat and ate our picnic lunch while admiring the tower and watching a game of bocci between two locals !",1
"during the day , not very impressive but , as darkness descends , the tower lights up and becomes an amazing site .",1
buy skip the line tickets way in advance .,1
i ca n't say enough how amazing this place is .,1
city of lights a must do .,1
you have to go directly under the tower get a pass to take the the elevator up .,1
it 's been almost 6 years since last visited .,1
quite simply there is nothing like this anywhere else on earth and to visit paris and miss it would be unthinkable .,1
i would recommend booking in advance so you can skip the long queues .,1
really cool to see this up close and in person but for me the street vendors and local scammers tend to take away from the experience .,1
be sure not to miss the top view .,1
"heads up : reserve tickets online the day before , you avoid the long waiting lines ; -rrb-",1
"we booked entry to the top in advance , certainly avoided queues .",1
"went up at 5 , that way got to see the views in day and night , as it was dark by the time we went down .",1
there is everything to love about paris .,1
visiting the eiffel tower while in paris is a must .,1
the new security around the tower takes away from the experience of walking around looking up walking the free steps to level one platform .,1
we went for an evening tour and out guide was able to point out and discuss stories about all the main attractions and sites around paris .,1
beware of girls with clipboards asking if you speak english - they will try to get you to give them money .,1
"i have been to it twice in my life and while i loved it , i had some reservations on the management of the while area where it is located .",1
beautiful grounds .,1
"my family had a private tour , where we went behind the scenes to see how the lifts work .",1
i believe it was 21 euros per person to go to the top .,1
we booked it a day in advance and we had no problems with getting five tickets .,1
there are few eateries near the tower apart from the restaurant on the tower itself .,1
it was within walking distance of our hotel -lrb- west end -rrb- which made it much easier to visit more than once .,1
"this can be scary , take the first level , from here you have a nice view already .",1
encourage to visit .,1
we opted for a guided skip the line tour to minimise queues which are inevitable i 'm afraid and all part of tourism at popular sites .,1
eiffel tower is well worth a symbol of paris & you should not miss it when travel here .,1
the tower is as spectacular as you would imagine .,1
"was exactly like i imagined it ... except there were so many tourists , it was hard to move around !",1
the views are breathtaking and we as a family were left breathless with the views .,1
we went during the week .,1
"our guide was informative and very friendly , and was able to weave us to the front of the lengthy lines .",1
"as the evening was so hot , it would have been lovely to sit and enjoy an ice cream whilst taking in the views !",1
people were jumping the queue and there were no staff to keep order or prevent queue jumping .,1
may be some kind of megalomania of the makers .,1
we had made advance reservations to go to the summit in the daytime .,1
the best view for pictures of this landmark would be at the trocodero side .,1
especially in evening when lighting is beautiful ... only bad thing is waiting for lifts ... .,1
it did n't seem real at first .,1
the view is amazing from every floor .,1
i was so lucky that it was raining too .,1
took our kids this time .,1
there 's also the ` glass floor ' .,1
the first floor is having hotels with artificial grass floor .,1
"sounds too touristic , but still very beautiful .",1
i would definitely recommend stopping at a monoprix or any other grocery store and buying something there so much cheaper that way !,1
we avoided all of those areas but one time and severely regretted it walking through it .,1
every person visiting paris must visit the eiffel tower .,1
"so we did take heaps of photos , as well as a ride in it .",1
gorgeous landmark .,1
it makes you smile when you hear the gasp of people seeing it for the first time .,1
it is a great exercise !,1
for some reason the workers at the eiffel tower decided to stop going to the top at 2200 instead of 2300 .,1
the food is michelin star standard .,1
i got off trocadero -lrb- station -rrb- and gasped when i saw it for the first,1
no need to go all the way up to the top .,1
this place is for sure value for money .,1
the visibility was reduced at the top due to low cloud but it was still wonderful .,1
took train from london .,1
"i booked tickets through an external company for 26 euros for both of us , highly recommend getting tickets before as the queues can get quite long !",1
for me the best place to visit in paris .,1
impressive in every aspect .,1
"romantic place from movies , i like it a lot more during the night than during the day , in the evening is a wonderful illuminated .",1
would recommend to go at night time so you can see the lights of paris ...,1
love being in france !!,1
i first saw the eiffel tower from a night time river cruise and the sparkling lights were just wonderful .,1
"the eiffel tower what can one say , just as seen on tv etc absolutely spectacular wo n't disappoint .",1
i bought delicious chocolates at the top of the tower to bring home as gifts .,1
and it was so big it felt like it was n't even real !,1
despite the cold weather we had a fantastic family experience taking the lift to the top and enjoying the sights .,1
regardless this line afforded opportunities to see sites others did n't .,1
the light show at the eiffel tower is a must do if visiting paris .,1
"did n't bother going all the way to the top , the view from the first and second levels are perfect .",1
of course if you are in paris you have to visit this iconic site .,1
"and the service was fantastic , the staff being extremely patient as we practiced our french !",1
you could also purchase champagne flutes at the top and is great for romantics .,1
it is a must-see when in paris and makes for great memories .,1
"we timed it well , we had a breath-taking view of the sunset and it was lovely , albeit , cold .",1
a must do every single time in paris !,1
when taking my sons to visit 30 years later i was terrified to ride the elevator to the first level .,1
mostly in the night .,1
i was really excited to see the eiffel tower .,1
"definitely worth visiting , even if it 's just in the area to have a picnic on the ever so lovely grass and enjoy the beautiful gardens surrounding it .",1
"thus , i was forced to stand in a long line to get tickets .",1
cheesy ?,1
get there early to line up to climb to the top .,1
impressive looking at it from the ground but the view of paris from the top was phenomenal .,1
do not just stay from the outside .,1
costs 17 euros to get to the top .,1
the queue was long but it is worth waiting for this experience .,1
must come back again .,1
we visited it twice to see it at night .,1
watch your possessions .,1
the two hours were quite sufficient for viewing and photographing .,1
the city or attraction should do more to run these people off .,1
"go straight to the summit , then spend as much time as you want on each floor on the way down .",1
please be prepare to queue for at least one hour to get your ticket -lrb- more queuing when you get up to the tower if you are planning to go to the top and to the toilet -rrb- .,1
definitely recommend booking a skip the line tour to get immediate access to the tower and also visit the top level .,1
you do n't have to take the ride to the top bit you should .,1
"the eiffel tower is an impressive engineering marvel by the well known gustave eiffel , who designed other engineering marvels throughout the planet.we have visited it on every trip to paris , summer or fall and once it lights up , you can notice it from most anywhere in paris.it gives me bearings on where i am in the city of light.lines are usually a problem but its worth taking the lifts up or the staircases if you are fit.one of the wonders of the world and trocadero is just stunning when you emerge from the metro and are confronted by the grandiosity of this steel structure .",1
"would recommend coming here about 3pm as the queues where a lot smaller that earlier in the day , a simple ticket to the top cost 17 euro -lrb- good price concidering -rrb- the champagne bar at the top was worth the bragging rights of saying you had a glass of champagne at the top of the eiffel tower -lrb- 12 euro -rrb- would also recommend in comming back at night when it is all light up , truly mesmerising .",1
"i have visited the eiffel tower 3 times , yes it is fascinating to see and it is huge when you get up close to it .",1
something that you can not miss to do !!!!!,1
there was none there organizing the crowds trying to get down .,1
haha -rrb- there u can have a fun with people who try to take an `` original '' photo -rrb- -rrb- haha but anyway -rrb- -rrb- most visit -rrb- -rrb-,1
i mean ... you 've got to see the eiffel tower while in paris .,1
so decided to go back later in the day as it was too hot to stand for longer .,1
"what a stunning piece of architecture , this monument can be seen from all over paris , if visiting during peak times the line up to go up the tower can be up to 6 hours , tip get there early as it opens , a must see",1
book your seine river tour same day as the beateaux cruise is just a walk away .,1
"i totally recommend booking this tour even online before you go on holiday if possible , it 's well worth every cent !",1
completely ridiculous crowds with unreasonable wait times .,1
"parisians hated the tour when it was first put up , and they were right .",1
there is nothing i can say what has n't already been said about the eiffel tower .,1
"the views are great and you can actually see everything better , closer .",1
a trip to paris is not complete with out a trip up the tower .,1
a selfie phone with your loved one is also mandatory .,1
is a must visit place .,1
we went to the second level and the views from all sides were fabulous .,1
this was trully a magical experience .,1
the view is great but my maaaain concern is that you 're missing paris 's most famous landmark which is the tower you 're in .,1
the eiffel tower is busy .,1
the thrill of seeing it light up and twinkle was sooo nice : -rrb-,1
the eiffel tower opens at 9 am so getting there at 8 am is n't the worst idea ever .,1
"in 1992 it was a bit of a free for all , in 2013 it was open access underneath and in 2017 is is full on security as per the standing state of emergency that has been paris for the last two years .",1
something you have to experience and do .,1
the eiffel tower is a great view of the city of paris .,1
this was a bit of a longer line/wait for the elevator ticket line .,1
everything went smoothly .,1
we paid about 7 euros to get in and walk up the tower .,1
be prepared to wait .,1
"i recommend take the lift to the highest floor , the view of paris is amazing .",1
we skipped the long queue via fast access and went to the first floor by a lift .,1
i just visted the base i did n't want to walk up the tower .,1
it 's one of the most famous and iconic places in the world !,1
i could not care less if this is how the company wants to treat paying visitors that have come to their country to spend money on tourism -lrb- given the current terror threat levels as well -rrb- .,1
had the place practically to myself on a cold saturday night in jan !,1
"but when you come closer , only thing you 'll keep thinking is : ` damn !",1
huge high and beautiful masterpiece .,1
"however , it certainly makes for a great photo subject and paris would n't be paris without it !",1
lines can be long .,1
"the views of the tower are breathtaking , from far off and close up .",1
you know you want to ... especially if you 're in paris .,1
there is lack of public toilets and the only one we found was not usable for hygiene reasons i ca n't specify here but one word it was disgusting ... wakeup paris and look after your heritage and do n't take it for granted .,1
i met a great geordie couple who made the waiting much more pleasant .,1
crowds .,1
i think it 's very pretty and perfect for a selfie ; -rrb-,1
love taking photos of it in different angles .,1
i managed to time the arrival for a few moments before the first light show of the evening .,1
"i went on a weekend -lrb- might explain the crowds -rrb- in october , got their at 4:30 , it was dark by the time we got to the top !",1
it lived up to the expectation that it would be an awesome experience .,1
excellent views across paris .,1
hourly light show at night is amazing .,1
it 's super awesome .,1
hucksters are all around .,1
we arrived on a thursday around 3pm .,1
the queuing system is the worst i 've ever seen .,1
hope this helps !,1
i have been to paris many times and still ooh and ahh when i see it .,1
worth watching especially at night time when the complete lightning is there.worth watching when the sky is clear .,1
it was a warm sunny day and beautiful .,1
good thing to see from a river cruise .,1
a beautiful place to be high up in the eiffel to keep you love and romance a live enjoy !!!!!,1
we did not go up this time .,1
paris was my first city out of north america i visited .,1
its really more impressive than you can emagine it .,1
"since this is probably the most visited place , book your admission in advance as it gets really crowded and lines get really long .",1
the lights and romance vibrance surrounds us and glows the mood .,1
fourth time in paris but first time i 'd bothered to go up and it was definitely worth it !!,1
viewing the underground bunker and behind the scene cogs of the eiffel tower gave an interesting perspective of this much loved monument .,1
we were disappointed because once we got to the first landing there was still a 90 minute wait .,1
"at 9am on saturday there really was n't a very long line to go up there at all , but by 10am , the line was quite long .",1
but the elevator to people ratio is so bad .,1
bigger than expected !,1
"anyway , its obviously a must if you visit paris but the queues are reaaallllly bad .",1
it was a great observation level and we took many photos .,1
i would recommend this for older children and adults as it is just a -lrb- special -rrb- building but is quite interesting .,1
france is clearly in a state of emergency ; police with big guns were everywhere .,1
try to stand by the windows to get a look outside while going up and down .,1
you will experience a beautiful dazzling light show and less people .,1
a 1-1/2 hour wait and a 40 minute wait .,1
the summer months is a great way to see europe as the day was long .,1
"we had lots of time to wander around on our own before the summit , where the champagne bar is a delight , while sipping champagne you get to breathe in the fresh air and the whole of paris",1
"only downside is the growth of queueing due to security checks , although of course there is is a good reason for these .",1
i 'd advise to buy the 48 hour pass to avoid queues !,1
my first time in paris and i definitely wanted to have dinner at the eiffel tower .,1
"for the visit , if you are in a good physical shape , do n't hesitate to climb .",1
you cant come to paris and not see this .,1
"we spent about 3 hours or so looking around , souvenir shopping , and eating at the restaurant .",1
great monument to see .,1
views are just incredible .,1
"you ca n't visit the paris , and not visit the eiffel tower !",1
"with the current terrorist scare in france , there were hundreds of police and military around .",1
we walked from st. germain to the tower on a beautiful clear day .,1
"we approached from the park , between the square cut trees and the clear direct views , we did n't need to use the trocadero as a photo spot .",1
40 of us cycled 150 miles from brighton to paris and finished at the eiffel tower .,1
the lights were on up and down the tower and across paris 's bridges .,1
its very romantic !,1
no lines .,1
mixed emotions !,1
"an icon of paris and france it may well be , but it 's also an incredible monument to the skills of men who built this without cranes and lifts , as we have today when building tall structures .",1
a must for couples !,1
nothing else needs to be said .,1
eiffel tower ... very nice place to visit ... it.s good idea to go walking upstairs to the second level so you can enjoy the nice view of paris ...,1
we pre-booked which is really easy on-line .,1
it made for a fantastic trip up with great views and nice pictures .,1
there are great historical signs and information to read .,1
paris beautiful place to visit,1
"the eiffel tower is beautiful , especially at night .",1
as a historic and known landmark it is recommended to be visited but do not expect something exceptional .,1
do n't miss the glittering tower after the sunset .,1
we decided to go to the top and it was 100 % worth it .,1
it is truely a engendering marvel .,1
"the views are worth the endless queues , so perseveres !",1
"went to the first level only as second level -lrb- top -rrb- was closed , very strict security -lrb- understandable -rrb- , great views of the city , very cold up there !",1
"they will say they are looking for a donation to save the handicap , hearing impaired anything .",1
we booked the 2nd floor fine dining restaurant for lunch just to avoid the queue .,1
my only concern was the very pushy flower sellers at the base of the tower .,1
the wait for same day tickets was several hours long .,1
"even when paying for priority access as we did , there was a lot of shuffling along and waiting .",1
we had a lovely meal in the eiffel tower .,1
me and my wife decided to take a euro trip on our own for two weeks .,1
going later in the day when the queues are starting to dwindle is recommended .,1
awesome shops/attractions closeby .,1
to get back down it is worth considering walking the stairs from level 2 to level 1 or level 1 to the ground .,1
"go or leave at sunset , it is beautiful !!",1
what an amazing piece of architecture !!!!,1
lots of stairs .,1
went with a tour group which allowed immediate access and a way to avoid those long ridiculous lines .,1
"missed the lights `` show '' for minutes ... will get back again , for sure .",1
walk near the tower to trocadero and shoot beatiful pictures and then walk to the arc .,1
my 2nd visit to the tower .,1
i highly suggest arriving early to get in line .,1
the queues here are unbelievable so you will need to be patient .,1
"it gets dark late in the summer , but if traveling with kids still so worth having them stay up .",1
my partner and i decided to visit the eiffel tower at night instead of in the daylight so we could view the gorgeous parisian lights in their full glory .,1
just knowing it 's in the background is so exciting you ca n't possibly pass up on this attraction .,1
we had come on two occasions and the lines were so long that we were never able to actually get up the tower .,1
the best way to enjoy the tower is to go somewhere with a good view of it and to see it illuminated at night .,1
ca n't beat this part of your trip .,1
we highly recommend going to the top both during the day and at night .,1
no where on the signs did it say padlocks were not allowed .,1
"the views are wonderful , the crowds only slightly daunting .",1
"we love tower eiffel , would recommend a trip to the top and night both offer different experiences .",1
i 'll stop now as i 'd like all those who book this tour to enjoy it as much as my family and i did !,1
france needs to get there act together and clean this place up in my opinion .,1
we explored side roads and fell in love paris .,1
the summer lines are pretty long .,1
"we stopped by a few local shops and picked up a baguette , some charcuterie , cheese and wine and had a sunset picnic at the eiffel tower .",1
"lines can be long , if weather permits , go later in day .",1
"amazing views of the city and if you love heights like i do , its just a very fun experience .",1
"you got ta visit the eiffel , its a most .",1
a small gripe is that although tickets are timed to go in you can stay as long as you like and consequently it was very crowded making photo opportunities a bit challenging unless you are happy to have strangers in your photos !!,1
once in daylight and once after dark .,1
after taking the first elevator up we hopped directly on the second elevator and were among the first to get to the top and had the chance to take some pictures with space around us .,1
the lines can be long if you decide to go up so plan for that if you are there in prime season .,1
"good place to check out & cross off your bucket list , but expect to queue up a long time !",1
enjoyed a few kodak moments up there with a glass of bubbly .,1
it 's worth not having to wait in line when you are there .,1
it 's the eiffel tower and you 're in paris .,1
we were truly overwhelmed by the size of this structure as well as the history behind it and its creator .,1
surreal and very romantic .,1
"if you want to go up , make sure you do reserve your tickets way in advance !",1
the only tickets available were to the 2nd floor .,1
"i had not planned to climb or go to the top of the eiffel tower , but i am extremely thankful i did on a whim !",1
"although the 2nd floor is impressive in itself , we all went right to the top , where the views over paris are spectacular ; you 'll also find eiffel & eddison having a bit of a chat up there .",1
buy tickets in advance online to go to the top .,1
you must go all the way to the top for the best view of the city .,1
"personally , i respect the groups -lrb- approx .",1
"you will need to allow time for security checks , but otherwise got through much quicker than expected .",1
paris .,1
leave them at the hotel .,1
"whether you have been before , seen it afar or stood beneath this iconic monolith of a tower , it is every bit as awe inducing as it will always be .",1
there are also a lot of souvenir vendors and other solicitors at the base but firmly walk by and join the line up for a great attraction .,1
"well , i never get tired of visit this marvellous place and free my fantasy by taking photos -lrb- the ones here posted are mine , of course -rrb- .",1
"to skip queuing for tickets , do remember to buy tickets online which will save the hassle .",1
sadly the top was closed -lrb- you can go there only in day time -rrb- .,1
we could n't walk underneath without going through security as it was all fenced off .,1
"its so beautiful and easy to access , the views of paris from above are well worth the small fee to enter .",1
"my boyfriend and i visited paris last weekend , and although the weather was n't the greatest , we had a lovely time travelling up the eiffel tower , we had brought tickets via the internet the night before , and was easy to go through security -lrb- if the security on the main street is busy , walk towards the back of the eiffel tower , there is another security check point and is usually a lot quieter ! -rrb-",1
be prepared for security checks includin bag and body .,1
there is stair option for adventures people too .,1
the sheers scale of the structure is what hits you as you approach it .,1
"the night lightning show was spectacular , we climbed the stairs which were kind of scary as you can see thru the stairs all the way down .",1
have you seen the tower ? '',1
"bad side is just very long lines and waiting about 1,5-2 hours .",1
make sure you book online as you miss all the queues and also they have a huge problems with pick pockets in them .,1
"restaurant was good , very cold during the day .",1
i had no idea it was this big and architecturally stunning .,1
i will climb up to get the panoramic view of paris,1
"sadly , this was not the feeling i got when i returned last month .",1
we did n't pre book as you may be disappointed if the weather conditions are poor .,1
better to stay away from vendors around tower .,1
it 's not only an icon in paris but the entire world .,1
the view is unbelievably awesome !,1
you have to go there knowing there will be a lineup .,1
"we pre ordered our tickets for 8:00 pm , we waited in a small 3 minute line to get on to the elevator to go up , but other than that , we went right up .",1
"i 've been to the top , but would n't say it 's a must .",1
one the way down you can get off at the first floor which is high enough -lrb- ! -rrb-,1
the lights at night beautiful and ca n't be missed.it ca n't be missed as it is truly something spectacular !,1
"no matter how many times you see this , and from wherever you see it from , this is just too fascinating .",1
the tower itself is just as big and beautiful as before and still looks great when it is lit up at dusk - make sure you wait for the 3 minute sparkles show at 9.00 and 10.00 pm but i can only give it a 3 rating because of the appalling surroundings .,1
"need to plan to visit two times , day and night .",1
we probably waited on the security line and in the line to the elevator for about 5 minutes .,1
we walked through the jardins du trocadero where bottles of last nights parties were still visible .,1
if you want to go to the upper level reserve ahead or be prepared to wait for tickets at the upper level .,1
"stroll around the area , bring food and have a picnic in champs de mars to soak in the view .",1
buy your tickets on line the wait inside was shout 20 min .,1
majestic tower,1
as i was pressed with time i just had to do a quick run to the eiffel tower .,1
they should have at least considered signage posted a block or two out to stop people from traveling all the way to the base of the tower .,1
"was n't bad , just had to try it once in my life .",1
we made it up to the summit and glad we did .,1
beautiful does not even describe this gem .,1
"no security lines , no crowds .",1
very glad we booked this for the first day we arrived on thursday night .,1
"it is well kept , well built .",1
the park nearby is a lovely place to visit and the boat rides are easy and convenient way to visit all the major sights .,1
what is ther to say about this landmark that has n't already been said ?,1
he was ingenious .,1
the tower has a great architecture and has amazing views of the city and sien river .,1
there is no where to leave the stroller and it is a pain bringing it up with you .,1
do not miss the cruise on the siene but wait for the night fall .,1
`` tour '' consisted of our guide giving us a 1 minute spiel on the history o the tower and then walking us to the entry .,1
the crepe stall is the best .,1
you ca n't not go if you are in paris .,1
"we climbed up the stairs at the south pillar and only went to the second floor , which really is good enough !",1
weather was drissling rain and cloudy but by the time we reached the viewing platform on level 2 the sun came out .,1
lit up at night and would recommend trying to time the trip for around sunset so you see the city in the day and the night for the price of one visit,1
in the summer there 's a bar on the second floor .,1
we selected what attractions we wanted to wait for - and this simply was not one of them .,1
i love the view from its top !,1
i think of it as being a similar type of attraction as our empire state building .,1
"my wife and i had no schedule for our trip to paris , which make it a no pressure vacation .",1
obviously an icon in paris it is a must see attraction and also an architectural marvel .,1
"take your time to walk in the park around it , go for a run alongside if you have a longer stay or take in the beauty of it at night when it sparkles at nights .",1
buy tickets online to avoid the long queues .,1
this was actually my second time as i wanted my partner to see the view .,1
also it was interesting to go up at night - as i went in daytime before .,1
"in spite of the crowds and annoying vendors trying to sell something , the eiffel tower is a must-do for every visitor to paris .",1
i was there during the cop21 and the words related to environment as `` no planet b '' were appearing to it .,1
i had a group of 7 people and they all had a lot o fun and pleasant time !,1
it 's been my dream to see eiffel tower in person and i was so amazed how beautiful it is wherever angle you are .,1
the stories really help make the experience rather than just wanting to reach the top .,1
suggest pre-book the tickets .,1
this was the absolute opposite of what we have all seen and heard about french hospitality .,1
felt uncomfortable in elevator .,1
it was super expensive for our tastes .,1
it does get crowded with tourist and hawkers selling whatever you want or need but just take in the area and enjoy the views .,1
it is said that the only place in paris where you are not immediately aware of the presence of the eiffel tower is when you are at its summit taking in the breathtaking views of the city .,1
"we visited the restaurant , the food was lovely and we only had to pay to go up to the top from the 2nd floor .",1
"however , it was my first time in paris and i had to do it .",1
you can not go to paris and not go to the eiffel tower !,1
we enjoyed climbing up the stairs !,1
"we had booked in advance our lunch a the first floor , so from there we went to the top without any queue .",1
"book a reservation through your hotel , or you will have to spend 90 minutes or so in line , and it is not worth it ...",1
the views that high were spectacular but the the eiffel tower is not the only place to see the view if the city ... sacre coeur which sits on a hill also have a nice view of the city as well .,1
lines were long to the top by 10 am on a thursday .,1
"what more can i say , its the eiffel tower , you cant not be impressed !",1
in october the ques are short and its quick to get up to first level .,1
they are totally worthwhile and turn a long wait for tickets and entrance into a pleasant and easy means of access .,1
we bought ours with a tour which meant we did n't wait in line and just went straight pass the others waiting to go in .,1
the tickets could be processed as e-tickets to save printing which was a big plus as we were already holidaying at ...,1
"i do n't think the view from the top is worth the wait nor the price so i do n't recommend that , but you should take in the size and structure of this monument !",1
i went to the top of tower as well .,1
the crowds are annoying and make really enjoying the tower hard but the view really does give you a perspective of the city .,1
go to trocadero at night to get a nice view of the tower all lit up .,1
beautiful at night if you can catch the few minutes when its lights are on and then when they twinkle .,1
there is a `` light show '' at midnight and at 1am when the attraction closes-it actually looks better to see that from a distance .,1
i appreciate the history and icon the tower represents but it 's terrible service and bad running just ruins it .,1
very beautiful from all angles .,1
"my tips would be to buy priority tickets or tickets in advance because the queues are extremely long to climb it , around a 45 minute wait , and it was during the beginning of october when i went .",1
"i strongly recommend that you take the elevator to the top once in your life , although once is probably enough .",1
an amazing experience and the views spectacular .,1
best way to start the week end .,1
it 's less crowded that way .,1
you have to take into account that you are going through security first and that long lines may make you take longer time than expected .,1
unbelievable .,1
the restaurants eiffel 58 was a perfect choice for dinner .,1
the eiffel tower is beautiful and inspiring .,1
truly a must see in paris .,1
but of course it is an expensive 5 course meal but worth it cause it was an excellent meal too .,1
i saw it during the day and the sight was amazing .,1
the tower was much larger than i thought it would be .,1
we went at night - took the 69 bus from the louvre and got off about 5 minutes walk away .,1
built in 1889 .,1
stunning views across the city from all angles .,1
"went at night , no waiting , went to the very top and the view was fantastic .",1
looks poorly presented with metal gates at the moment but they 're putting up glass ones in the autumn .,1
"loved this place , worth the wait !",1
omg how amazing was this .,1
so please beware and ignore such scams .,1
"amazing and inspiring , always wow to visit .",1
the restaurant could be better .,1
who does n't like eiffel tower ?,1
was lucky that there was a nice little cloud cover that day which made the entire scenery even more beautiful .,1
paris + eiffel tower = complete !,1
the view at the top is well worth the queue time although plan your visit early in the day to avoid the heat in summer .,1
it is much better to see it at night because of the lights .,1
security needs beefing up .,1
we went all the way to the top .,1
"well , surely one of my fav place in paris .",1
the most beautiful `` uggly monument '' of the world !,1
"filled with tourists and hawkers , still gives you a good feel when you are around et .",1
"stunning panoramic views , and an iconic building .",1
"we climbed as far as we could but you have to take an elevator if you want to go all the way to the top , and the lineup was too long for us .",1
who does n't want a picture taken here ?,1
"visited on a 30th birthday with friends a great attraction , security was a bit over the top .",1
there is an elevator too for those who do n't want to climb :--rrb- .,1
my recommendation is that you make sure you are in the correct line at all times and keep in mind that language can be a small barrier .,1
"i was expecting to be tired , but i was up to the first floor in less than 10 minutes , and up to the second in another 10 .",1
we booked our ticket to the summit on line a month in advance but still faced ridiculously long queues to get to the summit and gave up after 30 minutes wait - so much for reservations !,1
it was an amazing experience but the wait time was almost 3 hours in the heat - they spray this mist on you but it was the view was spectacular - the champagne at the top 11 euros a glass - wouldnt miss the experience,1
security is tight & rightfully so !,1
"personally , i think the view from arc de triomphe could rival the eiffel 's view because from there you can get the eiffel tower in your panoramic shot and it takes less time if you 're in a rush .",1
we loved the short walk to the eiffel tower .,1
got the lift to the restaurant on first level and walked up to the next level after lunch -lrb- about 350-400 steps -rrb- .,1
entry was quick and easy and took about 15 minutes through security and ticket queue .,1
if you visit paris visiting the top of the tower is one thing you must do .,1
"and yes , it 's a wonder for every single angle and time , day or night the eiffel tower makes you loose your breath .",1
we stayed in a hotel 2 minutes away meaning we had a view of it from our room .,1
i really enjoyed it .,1
"the eiffel tower is more impressive in person than any photo and was well worth the visit ... and if i thought it was impressive during the day , it was even more stunning at night .",1
it is such a beautiful and short walk !,1
did n't get any tickets up front -lrb- could n't had all sold out -rrb- so just watched the queues for a couple of days as we went to and from the hotel .,1
more then one ticket both inside gates to .,1
"queues were long ; to get into the area beneath the tower -lrb- where you can get your tickets -rrb- , the ticket booth queue , and the queue to get into the tower itself .",1
all of a sudden a oriental couple appeared to help them clean the bird dodo off their backs .,1
but its worth it ...,1
"it was a great way to see paris , the city of light .",1
keep your distance unless you want to be harassed !,1
"we had pre-booked a skip-the-line experience , which i highly recommend as the standard queues were really long and very slow to move .",1
its just fantastic .,1
"be prepared to wait at least an hour under the heat to get by the first round of security check , another hour to purchase tickets for the elevator , another 30 to 45 minutes for another round of security check before you can reach the waiting area to enter the lift .",1
it 's not for the faint hearted .,1
unfortunately we were not able to find ticket to go to the top .,1
we then got ` half searched ' so it seemed a bit pointless !?,1
-lrb- personal experience : 2007 -rrb-,1
the # 1 must see of paris .,1
the only way to do this is to purchase a skip the line tour .,1
"due to history , it 's still an interesting structure .",1
if you go early you will miss the big lines .,1
if your going to go to paris i think its safe to say visiting the eiffel tower is a must .,1
the security control was exaggerated compared to other places -lrb- louvre or opera -rrb- .,1
my favorite part was when the lights came on and then they started blinking .,1
must see if you are in paris .,1
"even though the football was in full swing with the fan zone in the champs de mars underneath the eiffel tower , the queues for the tower were really short , probably due to pre booked time slots ?",1
the eiffel tour is a must see when visiting paris but really disappointing that tickets up the tour are seemingly only available through agents are multiples of the actual ticket prices,1
"our kids -lrb- 10 , 14 and 16 -rrb- skated and enjoyed hot chocolate while we watched and had a glass of wine .",1
"i think the most important thing to do is to see it both day and night , as every hour on the hour starting at 10pm it sparkles !",1
"found it very tourist friendly - a nice play space for children , and just a really nice spot to walk around and read about how it was built which to this day is amazing .",1
all the really annoying people who are treying to sell you the weirdest crap no one needs .,1
this was my first trip to paris and i did n't book to visit the eiffel tower before visiting paris so my partner and i did have to queue for over an hour but it was more than more the wait .,1
brilliant view from the top .,1
no if 's and but 's just go for it .,1
yet there is no way that you will be able to avoid the crowd - even if it is january .,1
this beauty is great to be seen and meant to be seen however you can .,1
hub of activity day or night .,1
a paris highlight,1
seeing this in person was much better than i could ever have imagined ... its the eiffel tower ... enough said,1
clearly visible security is up !,1
it was a memorable visit to paris and to see the eiffel tower .,1
we got there at opening time .,1
waiting in line in the cold to go to the top -- not worth it .,1
resting from freezing weather i had my snack inside one of the shop .,1
the tower has a restaurant and is expensive but worth it just once !,1
it is breathtaking !!!,1
this was the highlight of my whole trip to paris !,1
i would suggest allowing two hours for your trip to the eiffel tower .,1
the queues are extremely long at eiffel tower anyway so you must book in advance !,1
we went on day cloudy and expecting a shower or two .,1
we were in paris for a week and simply did not want to spend our time standing in long lines .,1
had a picnic under the tower during the day and drinks across the street at night .,1
"when we first got to paris and we spotted it from afar , i though , oh , it 's ok .",1
then we decided to walk up and see if its all its cracked up to be .,1
we didnt waste hours queuing which was great .,1
"we spread a blanket out , had some local food , the sun went down and they put the tower on sparkle !",1
amazing trip !!,1
the metal structure is amazingly done by eiffel that 's why they call him the metalwizard .,1
loved seeing this attraction !,1
"we 've all seen images of it for years , but wow .",1
there is a coffee shop and a souvenir shop as well .,1
the food was delicious and our fellow diners were great .,1
lines were somewhat long waited 1 hour but it was so worth it .,1
elevator recommended right to the very top floor .,1
"not always loved , today is a great landmark that nobody that visits paris misses .",1
spectacular views of all iconic paris locations beautifully aglow !,1
"i look at the ratings for tour eiffel and see that 300 + people rated it as poor , and it makes me wonder whether they were here in the middle of a hurricane ... because , for the life of me , i can not imagine anyone not being blown away by this magnificent structure .",1
i just loved when the eiffel tower lights started blinking .,1
two viewing platforms - a ` first floor ' and the ` summit ' .,1
you can pay for everything you buy on the tower using credit/debit cards .,1
i took the stairs up .,1
"every hour upon the hour the eiffel tower sparkles , it 's absolutely stunning !!!!",1
if you get a chance visit the tower of a night .,1
20 thousand folks visit daily .,1
still so beautiful even i have been here before .,1
everything looks good both at the day time or at the night time !,1
the atmosphere is really good around but a bit disappointing that there are rats eating from the garbage in the area around .,1
it was one of the best experiences of my life .,1
our hotel was close by so we saw the eiffel tower a bunch of times at various times of day .,1
i highly suggest to buy advance ticket -lrb- s -rrb- because the line to get up to the top can get ridiculously long .,1
it 's worth it just for the amazing view at the top .,1
and a climb it is !,1
it 's all run very efficiently and there are signs everywhere in different languages to help everyone .,1
i went up in the evening but it maybe better to visit it during the day .,1
we avoided this by having lunch at the le jules verne restaurant -lrb- big bucks -rrb- .,1
a world class visit .,1
the views are spectacular from any level but if you can get to the top level .,1
might be a cliche but it ´ s absolutely worth it .,1
"second visit and again impressed with the view , it can be very crowded , we paid extra to queue jump , which was well worthwhile .",1
"the view from the tower is wonderful , it 's a must when in the city .",1
glass of champagne was a bit over the top but ca n't not do it,1
"we are 2 psychologists , `` flooding '' each other .",1
we were lucky enough that we did n't have to wait in the queue for long .,1
reservations in advance online is best way .,1
"standing in line , even with a reservation , in huge crowds , made this somewhat unpleasant .",1
you will need a small level of fitness to climb up and you can only take the stairs to the second level but you can catch the lift from the 2nd to 3rd level for an additional cost .,1
hard rock cafe there is really nice .,1
2nd floor reservations are hard to get .,1
good to see the eiffel tower for real .,1
we got there at 10.30 and queued for the lift .,1
"usually dread the very touristy places , but seeing the eiffel tower in real life was breath-taking .",1
"stay when it gets dark and you can see it flash lights every hour on the hour , just magical !!",1
"a paris icon and should not be missed , can get very busy so be prepared for queues though the wait is worthwhile .",1
if you are from the us you know how to be firm and you will be fine ...,1
i should 've waited for them outside the security line and they can join me .,1
worth the trip !,1
started queuing at 8:45 to get through security when it opened at 9:30 .,1
i am part of the crowd as well .,1
we walked down from the middle level which if you 're up for it is a good way to have a more intimate experience .,1
take elevator to first level at least if you can .,1
"be sure to wear a hat and scarf , wind is so wildly on the top of it ~",1
it is quite a spectacle and definitely should be part of your paris visit .,1
"as a person who loves architecture and loves a good view from up high , the tower was awesome !",1
lots of queuing but ultimately worth the wait .,1
think it was very expensive too .,1
yes it was very cold -lrb- to be expected in january -rrb- but its a lot quieter and there is a reason its called the city of lights !,1
"we visited on july 14th for fireworks , which were awesome .",1
nice wide steps .,1
for new years was very nicely decorated .,1
but happily eiffel tower is beautiful at his own,1
"we took the lift to the top which was rather cramped with people , although there was no space they kept pushing more people in .",1
we did the `` trip to the top '' on our recent european vacation and we could not have been more impresses .,1
the views are without par and stop for a glass of champagne served by the glass to further enhance your experience .,1
"the view , the history and the feeling to be on sucha great monument is stunning .",1
trip up the tower is a must and dinner at either restaurant is a great experience,1
needless to say that the view is breathtaking especially at night .,1
loved this place !,1
the views always amaze .,1
only down side is constant haggling of the street sellers .,1
be amazed by how incredibly big this tower is and how well constructed it is too .,1
"well , you also get a great view from the basilica in montmartre ... for free .",1
views of paris were amazing 360 degrees .,1
the famous park where romantics come to picnic and sip champagne lovers kissing in front of the tower .,1
"you ca n't even walk under the tower without purchasing a ticket , and it is surrounded by nasty-looking temporary fencing .",1
we had the worst experience ever here .,1
we did n't wait a long time to get the tickets and go to the first floor !!,1
the eiffel tower is indeed the heart of paris .,1
amazing view and worth the wait and dollar invested .,1
we got in the queue at 09.10 and by 10.20 we were at the top .,1
worth checking out if it 's on your list - even if you do n't have advance tickets .,1
"also , worth while to visit palais de chaillot across the way .",1
"spend time on the lawn taking photos , souvenir shops and snack vendors were enjoyable with places to sit and admire the eiffel tower !",1
very nice view from every floor and not so much queue at lunch time on weekdays .,1
"a really great tour , with a small manageable group .",1
very impressive in size and grandeur !,1
lots of people queued up there and then got moved to queue elsewhere .,1
great evening spot no street gaming !,1
at the base you feel so small .,1
an unforgetable experience if it 's the first time you go .,1
loved the thought of going to the tower .,1
in short time i learning how they are trick .,1
we had reservations for the 2nd level then waited for 20 min for tix for the next level .,1
it really is surreal to see the tower in person for the first time .,1
not bad at all .,1
definitely must be visited and nice places to eat around there too .,1
this will be one of my most precious memories that i will forever cherish .,1
the most magnificent lunch for bastille day on 14 july .,1
we visited during the euro championship so it was very busy and a trip up the tower was an hour queue .,1
"lines to ride back down can be daunting too , so take the stairs .",1
"however , the eiffel tower was unexpectedly closed on june 14 because of the national strikes while disappointing , i completely agree with their decision based on not having enough staff to ensure security .",1
very small spice so go light,1
i 've visited this spot many times but it still makes for a great photo no matter how many times you 've stood under the massive iron lattice work .,1
it is a paris must !,1
"then , we went to the front of the main elevator line and rode up , but were lead away from the crowds inside a restricted area just for this tour and had a quiet view of the structure and scenery below .",1
"went in day time and at night spectacular light show on the hr every hr was breathtaking , its a real must see at night .",1
being up close and personal is the way to go .,1
we spent just 20 minutes in the queue but would advise people to book tickets to the top in advance if they can .,1
this wonder of the world is sure to leave you speechless !,1
"one must visit the famous landmark of paris , the eiffel tower and enjoy a panoramic view of the city from its 3rd and topmost level .",1
"the tower is lit up at night and every hour on the hour the lights twinkle for a few minutes , which is wonderful .",1
"so if you plan your visit to paris , this need to be considered , as you will have nowhere to leave your bags .",1
"the food was great , view was excellent and ambience perfect .",1
i had of course heard in the u s that the french people were rude .,1
would do just as well to go to second level and drop some mail post to friends !,1
we highly recommend enjoying a meal in the dining room .,1
the view is breathtaking all around .,1
we loved our visit .,1
"i know , it 's just a view , but what a view !",1
the eiffel tower is one of the first things that comes to your mind when you think about paris .,1
we went during the day so maybe it would be best to see at night .,1
it was my childhood dream to visit eiffel tower and it came true this year in march when i visited paris with my husband and toddler .,1
"i went to paris on a coach trip two years ago and had hoped to go up the eiffel tower , however , the queues were absolutely ridiculous and there was no way i 'd have time to do it as by the time i would have reached the front of the queue , my bus would be leaving , so when i went back to paris a few days ago , i booked my tickets online in advance .",1
try to take the stairs up the tower for a better experience .,1
"you can pretty much see it from all over paris and it always looks amazing at night , i was surprised that it was oven so late in the evening but thankful as you get a great view from there .",1
"did not have time to ride up , but just love the area , the view , the people .",1
one thing for sure to the all the tourists visiting ... watch out for the pickpockets .,1
it 's a very long wait for the elevator to the eiffel tower and a very long climb by stairs .,1
it 's an amazing place .,1
i was there just las week and because the weather is cold and it was later at night it was very quite .,1
i would minimize what you carry/bring to make the process easier .,1
and people asking you to sign petitions .,1
we would sit on the grass right in front of the tower and have drinks sold by the locals and relax and take pictures .,1
buy your ticket in advance online and evening is beautiful .,1
it was quite tiring but atleast i felt satisfied when i reached the platform .,1
"even if you hate paris , you can not help but love the eiffel tower .",1
age range 6 months to 70 years .,1
lovely place to visit day and night .,1
it was what was expected .,1
"it 's not far , and more time for photos .",1
seeing it in pictures does not do it justice .,1
seeing the eiffel tower while crossing the seine with fog around the top of the tower breath taking *************,1
"once you are there , it reminds you the reason why you are attracted to this city of lights !",1
the eiffel tower is spectacular both from a distance and up close .,1
but i still find it very impressive once i stand below the massive building .,1
"and you can get there by metro -lrb- bir-hakeim , # 6 stop -rrb- or rer -lrb- c line , champ de mars stop -rrb- .",1
be warned - there are lines for everything .,1
"bring a bottle of wine and enjoy the show from a park bench , or you can sit on the grass .",1
"the most iconic monument in paris , this one guarantees an unforgettable experience .",1
did n't climb up the tower but just observing it from below is equally nice .,1
"if you have money saved up try to eat at the jules vernes , the cues of paris are the best it s a place to go to and there you can dream and watch this wonderful city .",1
be prepared for crowds and be on guard for pick pockets .,1
but we made it to the top of tye tower and it was breathtaking .,1
stunning views from the top .,1
but it is confusing to book a reservation online and the lines take about an hour to get through no matter what time of day you are there .,1
"no matter how many times once sees this structure , you still get quite impressed .",1
"lineups are a major problem , suggest booking a tour company to circumvent the issue",1
"husband , 2 sons and i ran up every stair as high as you can climb without taking the lift - and what a reward .",1
"but wait , not done yet !",1
stunning views from the summit .,1
have been up the eiffel tower twice now and enjoyed both times .,1
quite a fright !,1
very lovely sight .,1
the views were breath-taking from our hotel room .,1
"the only thing i would reiterate is to be there early and make sure you go up during the day and come back at night to watch it lit up , especially ...",1
"beautiful structure that can not be missed , but if you want to go up in the lift , be prepared to wait , and wait , and wait .",1
spectacular view .,1
staff were very rude their are signs saying what object can not be in bags for security reasons .,1
"the restaurant is definitely worth a visit , lovely food .",1
"there is a restaurant , bar , visitor centre & shop , and a lot to see .",1
some quick observations thought :,1
unique must-do experience - fun to walk up the 702 steps to the second floor before buying tickets for the elevator up from the second floor .,1
views from the top are stunning and worth queuing for !,1
the park was also very pleasant .,1
"besides the sheer magnitude of the structure , paris truly has made the most of this beautiful piece and no wonder it is a cherished part of the city .",1
something you have to do when you visit paris .,1
i do n't agree .,1
the views will be unforgettable .,1
security is tighter now than it was a few years ago .,1
i recommend just viewing from outside or at the overlook on trocodero square .,1
"a world known landmark and one you might think to skip , it do n't .",1
it is a ridiculous effort and cost to get in though compared to what you get for the $ spent .,1
reservations are done months in advance i believe .,1
go see it up close !,1
it was so amazing to finally see this stunning landmark in person .,1
changes with sparkles on the hour .,1
best view at night is from the arc de triomphe .,1
it is open till 10:30 pm and generally less busy then .,1
it is not very easy to find good restaurants around eiffel so walk up to trocadero market for that .,1
"the queues were quite long , even in january but worth it .",1
did n't feel like we got what we had paid for,1
probably my favorite structure in the world .,1
i only saw this gorgeous tower at night and i can not imagine having seen it any other way .,1
it is a most impressive structure and a paris landmark .,1
"love this place , but have terrible fear of heights .",1
"if you do , expect long lines .",1
"i said this would not make for a good review , and that really set him off .",1
and i 'm going to call the guide and tell him to leave right away ! '',1
i recommend it to everyone !,1
"no lines , fast access .",1
the line for security and tickets was less than 30 minutes .,1
definitely worth going to see .,1
it was still good to visit .,1
definitely use the lift although the kids enjoyed racing up the stairs !,1
"but after i decide , that is maybe better to see paris during night from here , and form sacre ceur or montparnasse tower during day .",1
forcefully .,1
came here only last week,1
great place to visit at night nicer than in the day if your in paris it 's a must see place .,1
the more we descended the more it came into sight and was eventually in full view with all its grandeur .,1
but do n't bother with knick knacks .,1
you do n't need to be particularly fit as there were some elderly ladies -lrb- 60 + -rrb- walking just behind us .,1
"i 'm sure there are many other reviews that talk of the views - suffice to say , on a good weather day , they are fantastic .",1
we had an amazing time at the eiffel tower .,1
visited the eiffel tour on a saturday night around 9pm .,1
great experience to see .,1
"if you want to go up in the tower , you need to make reservations several weeks or more in advance -lrb- or risk waiting in the extremely long line and take your chances -rrb- .",1
very expensive stores and cafes .,1
"easy to get to on foot or by bike , and a must to visit !",1
you also have to see it at night !,1
absolutely stunning views when up at the very top !,1
we took the elevator to the top of the tower and the views are amazing !!!,1
visited eiffel tower today -lrb- aug 3rd -rrb- .,1
"we would highly recommend doing this , the views from the summit are magnificent !!",1
a lot of these reviews complain about the lengthy lines to get up into the tower and the skip the line tour tickets are well worth booking in advance to avoid those lengthy lines .,1
"there is another round of long queues just to get into the lift to the first or second level , and if you want to move to the top , be prepared to wait for another hour or more .",1
this review is about the fireworks not a visit to the eiffel tower,1
the best view is nighttime from the seine .,1
"the views over paris are stunning , even just from the first level .",1
"with the views from around the city , the eiffel tower is a must for any first time visitor to paris .",1
security was in force but did not detract from the experience .,1
we ended up buying food there and finding a spot on a grassy area on the south side .,1
when you get the view over paris .,1
"the euro futbol tournament was taking place that same week , so the tower would be lit with different colors for teams , that first night it was lit with rich rainbow colors in solidarity with the us following the tragic shooting in orlando , then of course the ` sparkle fits ' that took place other evenings .",1
took me 10 years to get to paris and finally climb all the steps to the top .,1
it was completely not worth it .,1
you can see it from so many places in paris where high rises are so less .,1
"it all went really well and we met our guide at the local office in the ave de la bourdonnais , a few minutes walk from the metro at ecole militaire .",1
"arrived before 11am on a sunday and got tickets , went through security and onto elevator in less than 20 minutes .",1
"it 's too busy and crowded , with pickpocket warnings everywhere .",1
when in paris where else do you want to go other than the eiffel tower .,1
overall brilliant attraction !,1
so decided on going to the eiffel on our own .,1
"crowded and not cheap to get up , you may not consider it worth the considerable queues .",1
of course you can not go to paris without a trip to the eiffel tower !,1
great service with a beautiful view .,1
this gives you skip the line access to the tower and many other museums/attracrions in paris including the louvre and l'arc d'triomphe which is another thing i would reccommend doing .,1
it was nice to see it at nice from the boat on the seine river as well .,1
great views from even the first floor -lrb- there are some glass floors which are pretty vertigo ago-go -rrb-,1
i believe it symbolize the glory of paris .,1
its a surreal experience to actually be there .,1
the queues to get tickets at the eiffel tower really are horrific .,1
"there are plenty of souvenirs and you can get some good bargains if you negotiate , however be careful , once you start bargaining it is very difficult to lose the vendor who will hound you for a very long time until you buy .",1
"we did n't go up , merely walked around and made plenty pictures of the uniquely coloured tower from different angles .",1
then you wait twice to come down .,1
we enjoyedgoingtothe eiffel tower .,1
"more than anywhere this landmark symbolises paris , we booked lunch beforehand in the first floor restaurant , which meant we did n't have long to queue and got to go up to the first floor in the lift .",1
"... and every hour , on the hour , the tower will do a light-dance !",1
avoid at all costs and pretend not to be english - they assume we all have money .,1
romantic beyond belief .,1
seeing the tower by walking under it is a must .,1
three queue entrances lots of stairs if prepared !,1
you go to a private entrance .,1
steve ricks recommended north ticket booth for faster service so that is the one i used .,1
"whenever the city lights the tower every night , it was just so romantic !",1
lovely experience .,1
i thought it was hard .,1
there 's a souvenir shop and a restaurant and for some reason a golf ⛳ course on the first floor ???,1
i visited the eiffel tour on june 2015 .,1
our ticket is dated dec 31 at 3:30 pm .,1
it is worth the wait and some aggravation .,1
"the walk that evening even though we wer told it was only 1 hour away , took us through many sites such as the cathedral -lrb- notre dame -rrb- , the bridge with all the love locks , we even watched a movie being filmed along the canal .",1
we kept 3 days for exploring the city starting friday .,1
"great view from the top , however , from other high top you 'll get better view as the eiffel tower must be in paris picture :-rrb- good experience but taking up too much valuable time from your visit .",1
"we visited the eiffel tower on bastille day which was of course , very busy .",1
be aware of tieves .,1
we took a cruise on the seine the next night and saw it sparkle at 10pm .,1
what a beautiful structure .,1
a great way to take in the beauty of paris,1
it 's a must see in paris .,1
from any location in paris you can always take the nearest metro and head off to the eiffel tower .,1
situated across seine river .,1
"if you can , i recommend walking up the stairs - the line is much shorter than the one for the lifts and you can also stop on the way up to catch the view -lrb- and also your breath ! -rrb-",1
go on the top of the eiffel tower in the morning and come back again in the evening to see the light show .,1
must be visited once to both levels .,1
hang around the open area .,1
else the view from the top is splendid .,1
do not miss the shimmering lights at night which comes on for five minutes every hour from 9 pm till 0100 hrs on the hour ... truly spectacular,1
great experience having dinner at the eiffel tower .,1
you ca n't have one family member line for tickets ... everybody has to line up or you do n't go up .,1
it will only get worse of course ...,1
"if you happen to be there like i was when there is a suspicious package scare and you have been on the queue for an hour plus , you will either have to re-queue or forfeit your attempt at getting on the tower .",1
however if you do wish to go up the eiffel tower i do recommend purchasing your tickets way in advance .,1
it save times afterwards .,1
"the lights are fantastic , and if you walk a short distance to the troccadero , you will find some lovely views of the eiffel tower to take pictures .",1
once you get to the top all will be good !,1
it was a thrill that all of us will remember for our lifetime .,1
definitely worth the time .,1
this is also a good place for people watching .,1
at the top you can look out onto the city below .,1
lots of aggressive peddlers .,1
"this is the number one tourist hotspot in the world , you have to expect long lines and lots of people .",1
this is a great place to visit !!,1
we got a horse drawn carriage ride from the base .,1
i 'll agree with everyone that the lines - queues are a hassle ... even with skip the line access at the bottom you are going to wait .,1
i highly recommend the tour !,1
"however , you would still need to buy a ticket if you want to go up to the summit which only available by lift .",1
all services are in english and french so no need to worry if you do n't speak french .,1
it 's gigantic metal and amazing tower .,1
"but it 's far from being the tallest building on the planet , so you expect big but not huge .",1
all photos taken are gorgeous i do n't even have to choose which to post on my social media .,1
it can be very windy at the top even in the spring or summer so bring something light to wear as an extra layer .,1
long queues sadly but the view from the top is stunning .,1
"of course it is a must to see , but nothing surprisingly .",1
if you are in the city see the eiffel tower by day and by night ✨,1
watching it during daytime or well lit during nights in close quarters or at a distance is a real delight to the eyes .,1
we could not take too many pictures of the iconic eiffel tower .,1
"i reckon once you have been up one or two then its more of the same , i am not saying do n't do it but my wife would never had forgiven me if we didnt go .",1
our tour guide was funny and made everything inter sting .,1
this was my first visit in 10 years as normally when i come to paris the queues are too long to wait with young children so i tend to use the tour montparnasse instead .,1
"instead , we packed a picnic and some wine and found a spot on the grounds beneath the tower .",1
i have been to the top of the eiffel during the day but never at night .,1
there were so many tourist around the tower on the ground and those who made it to climb the tower .,1
"if you 'd like to skip the line and you 're in top shape , you can walk -lrb- and back down -rrb- the ~ 12 flights up to level i but beware this is not for those with a fear of heights .",1
"too much pushy hawkers selling trinkets on you , many group of people asking if we speak english on the moment of our photo opportunity !!!!",1
"save yourself some heartache and money , just go to trocadero and take a picture of the eiffel !",1
i sit with the french people in the cafes and bars and just talk all day and night .,1
it becomes more cloudy and hazy at the top level .,1
it helps you plan your days activities as you can easily work out the best route .,1
"amazing views from the top , smoothly run , helpful staff .",1
so beautiful ...,1
"we booked tickets in advance , which were part of an excursion and included summit access .",1
"unfortunately , the ice cream booth was just closing for the evening as we arrived -lrb- approx 6.00 pm -rrb- .",1
we fell lucky and managed to queue at one of the entrances which just happened to open up first .,1
excellent guided trip - well worth the visit guided or unguided for the views alone .,1
"definitely over-priced , but we did learn a lot .",1
make sure you take advantage and book a tour ahead of time !,1
"i 'm not saying you need to go there to climb or ride it to the top observation deck -lrb- i am actually -rrb- , but there are plenty of splendid pics to be taken whilst on terra firma as well .",1
we took the lift up in the evening and decided to walk down after our visit ... i did n't enjoy the walk down .,1
"some people have said they prefer the views from floor 1 and 2 because from the top , things are too far away to appreciate .",1
it was the first time i had taken my 15 and 9 year old sons and they loved every minute of it .,1
overall this visit was a mere photo op to say `` i was there '' ; nothing else .,1
"if afraid of hights , try at least 2nd floor .",1
view the projection room and see the eiffel tower over time .,1
we entered via the security gate between s and e legs .,1
we got a tour because of the ability to ` skip the line ' but this can also be done online as an individual .,1
be careful of pan handlers .,1
"you can not go to paris and not see the eiffel tower , it is amazing .",1
"this place has some aura around it , the moment you step into , its like you enter another world .",1
really wonderful .,1
we really enjoyed it .,1
"queues were long , could only go to second level , top was closed , but the view was great , enjoyed this , caught subway was easy to get there rather than walking it again as was wet the day before",1
everything about it is amazing !,1
best to get there early to avoid crowds and long waits .,1
"as i started to film the tower the clock struck midnight , and as i facetimed with my mum and dad , something really special happened .",1
only thing is next time we would want to go up at night !,1
it was like herding cattle -- just stand somewhere in the distance where you can enjoy the view and skip the tourist attraction .,1
we went up the eiffel and it is ok if there are not much crowds -lrb- which was in our case as we went there around 8:00 pm -rrb- .,1
"our guide , a delightful young lady from canada -lrb- she said call me george -rrb- , combined her knowledge of the history of the tower , gustav eiffel , and indeed france , with great humour and respect .",1
a must visit spot - at least once in a lifetime .,1
the next day we visited the tower again & rode the elevator to the second level ; the views of the city of paris were amazing !!!,1
impressive and a must visit if you 're in paris,1
the process then to get in at your allotted time took 15 minutes .,1
just because i was there - been a couple of times .,1
i have had hordes of people tell me that the eiffel tower is an eye sore during the day .,1
"it 's close enough to see details , but far enough to see the whole tower ensconced in its surroundings that so enhance the viewing experience .",1
"we got a great guided tour and while we arent exactly the guided tour variety tourists , thank god we took it as we went on to learnt a lot of stuff we never new about the tower , its history and also the history of the city itself .",1
"check out the light show every hour on the hour after dark , it 's beautiful .",1
"it should be on your top list , i 've stayed in a hotel close to it ,5 mins only away , and the bathroom window was faced the tower and the balcony , i really enjoyed the view at night with tower lighting , whenever i went to champseles street i passed by it .",1
ì can only say that for me it was a once in a lifetime experience .,1
i had always romanticized about paris and la tour eiffel .,1
i would recommend this '' bypass the line tour and lunch '' presented by viator .,1
"overall , the structure is amazing even though i did n't take the lift to the top for a nice view of paris , but i still felt content .",1
my son had fun counting all the stairs we went up and it was a lot .,1
"take your time , enjoy the view .",1
"arrive early to avoid the queues , take the stairs to save a few euros .",1
i reseved the elevator ticket to the top top online and basically waited longer for the elevator to come down to the ground than in the line itself .,1
but you can still go up in the rain .,1
download the eiffel tower app and it will tell you all the things you 're looking at .,1
seeing the eiffel tower in pictures truly does n't do its justice .,1
really enjoyed going up the eiffel tower more than i expected !,1
up we went ; down we came .,1
we did and avoided the long queues .,1
but even from the bottom it 's an impressive site to see .,1
of course i am going to give it 5 stars .,1
but the desk we had to go to had a super short line and they were very friendly .,1
"it may sound cliché , but i just ca n't get enough of it .",1
"it looks extra beautiful from champs de mars with a bottle of wine , baguette and cheese ;-rrb-",1
quelle surpris !,1
we visited the eiffel tower at nighttime to have dinner at the jules verne and it provided a whole new perspective .,1
we had some luck that the queues were only about 30 min for tickets and another 30min to the top .,1
"on the hour , every hour it lights up for 5 minutes .",1
if you just turn up and join the queue be aware that it will mean a wait time of at least one hour and maybe two hours .,1
"i arrived in paris the day of the attacks in november , so my -lrb- much anticipated -rrb- experience of paris was somewhat soured , but i did still get the chance to visit the tower and i 'm so glad i did .",1
for only $ 17 you can take the elevator to the top and stop on each floor .,1
"security was everywhere , and watch out for the vendors outside who distract you .",1
"my first visit was in the summer , in the afternoon and the lines were crazy long so we just took a photo from the bottom and left .",1
"go early morning to avoid the crowds , any time during the day if you like the crowds and atmosphere , and late night to see it beautifully lit .",1
finally i came here ... it was amazing place to go however there is so many girls with petition to sign and they bug tourists with that .,1
"i would recommend going on a skip the line tour , that way entry is a lot quicker and the guide can tell you many interesting fact about this huge monument.the views are fabulous from all sides .",1
make reservations well ahead to go up in tower or expect hours and hours to wait .,1
it was very emotional to be on the eiffel tower on the day it reopened after the terrorist attacks after 13/11/15 .,1
there are several good spots to get the panoramic view of paris .,1
i would 've walked it except carrying a heavy backpack .,1
we were lucky to be in paris during a warm sunny day in november !,1
the park is also a nice place for a walk on a sunday afternoon .,1
take shorter time to wait in the queue if you take the stairs .,1
its magical in day and night time .,1
all in all it was worth the wait and had an amazing views .,1
we choisectye tour guide who met us at the tower gave us our prepaid ticket and did little more .,1
you must see this during the day and also at night on the hour when the lights really go wild .,1
it was an awesome sight to behold standing next to the tower and then going all the way to the top and viewing paris from all around the tower .,1
as suggested we did the top first then came back down to the first level .,1
i visited paris with my soon to be 13 year old .,1
if you want gifts they are brilliant and so cheap !,1
"totally disgraceful ... also there are young girls running round with clip boards asking if u are english , , wanting u to give a donation to deaf kids ... then they try to pick pocket u !!!",1
"we went quite late , it was a bit of a last minute thing , and we were n't able to get up to the 3rd floor , but , we walked up to the 2nd floor and it was quite a hike .",1
i really did n't have high expectations of the eiffel tower but i really was blown away !!!,1
"if you 're in a good fysical condition you might try climbing the stairs way up , i definitely choose to take the stairs down .",1
"the first time i was only 6 years old , the last one i had already turned 53 , and still feel like getting on a plane to paris just to go up to the third and last level of the tower .",1
there are lots of people selling gifts in the eiffel-area .,1
even if you buy skip the line tickets you will still have to wait ~ 45mins .,1
for years we had been viewing the place in pictures.news and multimedia that being there was a magical moment.the tower is awe inspiring and the surroundings overall are great .,1
we then proceeded into the machinery room - absolutely fascinating .,1
still a romantic place to be !,1
just think of the movie `` oliver '' and you will know what i mean .,1
"the summit has a champagne bar , the perfect place to get the wife a treat for her 50th birthday .",1
"as a side note , it was expensive to go up the tower , try to get a coupon before you go .",1
the lift went up diagonally and then vertically which was impressive but scared a few travellers .,1
"there were many vendors selling souvenir items and selfie sticks so if you wish to by from them , be sure you are ready to negotiate a bargain .",1
it is also worth visiting once at night and once during the day as it is lit up and very pretty at nigth too,1
my husband i decided he would walk to the first floor and i would queue for the east lift and meet .,1
some restaurants on the out skirt streets to sit down away from the tourists and have a glass of champagne too !,1
we had a great time spending time by this monument .,1
"there are better views elsewhere which you can take photos of , even with the eiffel tower in it !",1
all quite organised & smooth with lots of interesting facts to read .,1
there was two young girls approaching my children and asked them to write something and i stopped it .,1
we booked weeks ahead but still had to wait in long security queues and then line up for the ride to the top .,1
like everybody we wanted to go to see the view and live that ` magic and romantic ` expereince ' ...,1
the eiffel tower is the eiffel tower .,1
please do n't miss the ride up the eiffel tower !,1
"the eiffel tower is so much a part of paris , how could you skip it ?",1
"the whole experience was fantastic , exhilarating and such good value !",1
we still had to que for two hours to get to the top .,1
how can it not be amazing !,1
"subsequent days when it was open , there was heavy fog , you ca n't really see the tower and its view .",1
this is also something to keep in mind for those desiring to travel but have respiratory -lrb- copd -rrb- issues .,1
we then went through more security then took the lift up to the top !,1
view is a sight to behold especially when you reach the top !,1
"by the way the view was extraordinary , particularly because it was a relatively clear afternoon .",1
the 1am show was our favorite .,1
i enjoyed the view of it better than that from it .,1
you can not visit paris and not visit the tower !,1
you ` ll never feel tired to see it .,1
"we certainly wanted to go up the eiffel tower but despite planning months ahead , we could n't get tickets anymore at any time slot .",1
definately worth the experience .,1
eiffel tower is beautiful monument always reminding you witch city you in and it 's just lovely ;-rrb- but give it try you may be lucky enough all the way to the top ;-rrb-,1
by queuing before it opens -lrb- 1 hour before -rrb- we were at the head of the queue when it opened and easier got tickets to go to the top .,1
this is another must see in paris .,1
everyone knows the eiffel tower is amazing but seeing it live and lit up is indeed a wonderful site .,1
"i 've visited the tower on every trip to paris in the day and at night , and still her sparkle makes me smile .",1
"be careful as there is alot of scammers who try and get u involved in there cup game were they hide a ball or piece of paper and u have to bet were it is , u will see people `` placing bets '' on were they think it will be but they are also in with the scammers .",1
"really beautiful , safe and romantic place in paris .",1
you should reserve your ticket in advance because the lines are always long .,1
"if you want to buy ticket , you have to wait one hour ... if you want to reserve a table in some of tower restaurants , you have to do that two months earlier ... there is so much better places to visit in paris .",1
"the eiffel tower is awesome , she is a beautiful structure and stands so proud , the gudie took us straight to the 2nd floor and told us the ...",1
i 've been to paris many times ... the last trip i decided to go to the top .,1
it was cold and windy and the champagne bar at the top was closed when i needed it most .,1
went here a few weeks ago and i 'd really been looking forward to it .,1
it was a great way to see it unobstructed and take some amazing photos .,1
it is a tourist attraction !,1
the grandness of the iron and steel towering over you is breathtaking .,1
we visited eiffel tower for a dinner at the top of the tower .,1
so worth it and it 's relaxing to just sit in the park and watch people go by .,1
what will be the number one question most friends will ask a visitor to paris ?,1
come on its the eiffel tower .,1
my experience at the eiffel tower was n't great .,1
the views from above are simply stunning .,1
it 's not wut you expect when you go to see the eiffel tower .,1
not worth the money to climb to the top after 3 hour wait .,1
my only suggestion is to let people know exactly where the meeting place is .,1
"great views from the second floor , tickets reasonably priced for a main attraction .",1
"it happens at 9 , lasts about 5 minutes and plays every hour until 1 am .",1
do n't bring big bags .,1
truly amazing !,1
on holiday in spain we were getting the ferry home and we asked shauna would she like to see disney she said no she wanted to see eiffle tower .,1
what a sad ...,1
we tried 3 sandwich shops in all and this was the best by leaps and bounds .,1
"what fun , and how beautiful it was !",1
"for me one of the most spectacular views of my life , the eiffel tower literally takes your breath away .",1
we bought the tickets in advance at $ 17 and 11.50 which saved a lot of time & we entered through a separate gate .,1
got a bit tedious standing in the lines but you 've got to expect that when visiting major attractions .,1
after arrived eiffel start remember a friend warning about scrounger first not trust her .,1
"however , your pictures will not include the tower , so head up montparnasse tower instead .",1
so do head round to the south side .,1
"do n't forget to stop on the second floor for shops , food , & outdoor areas .",1
"it 's beautiful of course , but the crowds , lines , pickpocket signs and general gritty feeling of the grounds are not ideal .",1
"my husband and daughters decided to climb the stairs , so they got in line -lrb- the line was pretty short , but this could be because it was late afternoon and rain had just stopped an hour before -rrb- and bought their tickets .",1
but had n't reckoned on the long queues .,1
we arrived and made our way through the access entrance as i am disabled .,1
"we were there for euro cup , and it was fun to see what colors were going to illuminate on the tower .",1
"i was living in france , it is cold in may too .",1
the queue was a bit long for the gate but worth it once you get to the top .,1
purchase tour eiffel tickets in advance -lrb- 2-3 months before your visit -rrb- if you do not want to queue for hours and go to the top of eiffel tower .,1
great to watch old scenes of the tower on youtube .,1
"even if you can not get on the elevator , just walk along the seine at night and stare .",1
the waiter was very nice and we had no issues with service .,1
"once you get the tickets and enter the 2nd level , you have an option to visit the summit from there .",1
"plus , we were first taken a short distance from the tower and led underground to a series of tunnels that played a role in it 's construction , plus was used by german soldiers during wwii ; currently , kitchens here produce all the food sold in the tower 's restaurants .",1
"note that there are people trying to sell various souvenirs and bottles of wine there , but they 're not very pushy .",1
we can take picture from the 3rd floor without any fence surrounding it .,1
"but if you think about it earlier , you can make reservations on the internet .",1
have a picnic around the tower and enjoy w / some wine .,1
i 'd go back tomorrow .,1
that 's actually rather lovely in person .,1
i recommend going online well in advance to purchase tickets to go to the top .,1
we ere unable to buy advance tickets -lrb- booked out until late june -rrb- but the queue moved quite quickly -lrb- took about 20 mins -rrb- and the movement of people was efficient .,1
"and if you have time , go to the 3rd floor to see the gustave eiffel office .",1
took us to the 2nd floor by elevator .,1
"stood in the queue at 9 am , the gate opened at 9.30 , and we were in the tower by 10 .",1
"if you plan on going up it , book in advance online as its often booked up a month in advance .",1
"this is a must-see landmark of paris , and probably the most crowded .",1
"if you are planning on pushing your friend if the eiffel tower , you ca n't bwcause there is a cage of sorts covering the top .",1
"the security is brilliant with thorough checks -lrb- bag searches , scanners -rrb- the views are amazing .",1
we arrived at the eiffel tower around 8.45 am and joined the queue for the stairs .,1
but do not buy tickets for going to the top especially if you have been at the top of many other tall buildings/monuments before .,1
"we turned up amongst the thronging crowds , prepared to be overawed .",1
the view of paris from the second floor is really breath taking .,1
"ps : i 've visited it on september 2014 , not 2015 .",1
"truly , seeing is believing .",1
you can even get champagne at the top .,1
"obviously be wary of any mishaps as it can get really busy , but overall it was safe to just wonder around .",1
what can i say .,1
it 's very impressive that years ago without much technology they built such a structure .,1
absolutely fabulous !,1
the only reason it was 4 stars was that the top of the tower was closed .,1
for any first time trip to paris you must visit the iconic eiffel tower .,1
je t ` aime paris !,1
"now , i was standing-speechless in front of the tower .",1
you will be in awe of the 360 degree panoramic views of the entire city !,1
most of my french friends have n't been there since they were children .,1
the tower was also back lit with green lights .,1
best views around and after sunset .,1
"into a bunker and learnt about the history , the army using it for communications .",1
"the crowds were n't bad at that time , so it was pretty easy getting to the top .",1
it 's so much higher than i expected .,1
"awesome to be there but arrive early or very late , otherwise you get lots of people in the queue and is a bit frustrating",1
amazing during the day and even more amazing to see lit up at night !,1
"of course i 've seen the tower a thousand times in tv , on postcards , etc. .",1
even it 's not the tallest building of the world .,1
views from the top are amazing especially on a clear day -lrb- we got lucky !!! -rrb-,1
we arrived in paris and decided to take a bit of a walk around we headed to the eiffel tower at around 4 pm to find out the details for the next day .,1
the ride to the top seemed complete waste of money and effort to me .,1
"go with at our , or wait for ticket will be prohibitive .",1
the view is terrific and worth the cost to go .,1
i expected it to be larger than it was .,1
it was fun to try to find `` dead center '' and provided a whole different view of its majesty .,1
what an amazing structure .,1
must see it a few times on a trip !,1
the area has some street food and little stalls selling typical touristy stuff near the bridge where one can spend an hour or so .,1
a great view and worth buying the tickets through fat tire .,1
overall it was an amazing experience .,1
that was beauiful moment .,1
"we took the lift to the 1st floor , and checked out the exhibit .",1
be prepared for crowds !,1
very exciting and adults alike .,1
but it is still quite amazing when you see if for the first time and the night view is not to miss .,1
like anywhere in france watch out for pickpockets in paris and be aware that they offer to take your photos with your camera and then run away ...,1
"do not put your items down for even a second , that is all it takes for someone to run up and run away with your purse or camera .",1
it 's definitely worth the money .,1
"beautiful views , but so crowded .",1
the line was very long and i highly recommend this tour .,1
we decided to walk and save the money since we 'd already walked to the eiffel .,1
"lunch in the restaurant on the first floor needs to be booked up until 1400 , then you can walk in and get a table .",1
"good organization and booking tickets by anticipation avoid you to make hours of queue ... 1h to go up to summit ... controls and lot of people everywhere , but you can take time when up and take profit of view",1
we got a guide so got in and up with no wait and got some great history .,1
pre booked tour with citywonders which allowed us to skip the line and gave us a guide .,1
"a wet , grey , miserable day was lit up wonderfully by the eiffel tower standing majestically against the paris skyline .",1
"buy your ticket in advance , get there at dusk and enjoy every minute .",1
it can not be missed !,1
"it was one of the most beautiful day i have been to paris , not too warm , not too cold .",1
keep your stuff secure .,1
"the most beautiful piece of metal in the world , i suggest to see it on the trocadero expecially in the night time .",1
it 's a must do !,1
"really amazing , queues were annoying also but ca n't do anything about that .",1
a must see no matter how short your visit !,1
take the lift or stairs on a sunny day to the top for amazing views - do n't bother if it is cloudy or snowing .,1
if you are with lady this is great oportunity .,1
we would do it again if given the chance .,1
very rushed service full of silly mistakes .,1
this is a must tour destination for people who planned to do a city break to paris .,1
"the best place i have dreamed to see in france , exactely as advertized in the movies and the publicity a great place to see in paris .",1
there is a toilet -lrb- free -rrb- and a champagne bar in the summit .,1
"we went to this area , bought our reduced price ticket , and started the ascent up the tour .",1
the eiffel tower is of course almost the definition of paris .,1
i love the eiffel tower and have visited many times .,1
must do .,1
i would recommend seeing once both the the day and night time .,1
included a few courses !,1
buy reserved tickets -lrb- the line ups are long otherwise -rrb- for the last tour of the day .,1
"though it was not a clear day , seeing paris from the eiffel tower was a great experience .",1
i felt like the images i took had more depth at the lower level but both have their charms .,1
"when visiting the eiffel tower , purchase tickets online ahead of time to save time .",1
i been here twice to take picture but i did n't climb up because a long queue was waiting to buy the ticket .,1
"it 's a big , steel tower in paris .",1
one of the wonder 's of the world !!,1
so romantic and everyone around just seems so happy to be there !,1
"2nd floor had a large line to get to the top , i would say we waited about 45 minutes .",1
you can get some great photos from up on the hill away from the crowds .,1
the illuminated eiffel tower is not to be missed - a mandatory bucket list item for those who want to really experience the meaning of paris .,1
you understand the idea of the design of the paris when you see paris from the eiffel tower .,1
you need to visit the top and see the surroundings views its just an amazing construction with views all around with a nice cafe .,1
i was disappointed that my tour company only took us up the montparnasse .,1
"in my opinion , there are many more valuable ways to spend your time in paris .",1
definitely value for money -lrb- 17 euros -rrb- .,1
it is a once in a life time opportunity so just do it !,1
pretty .,1
"the tower frequently lights up to mark current events around the globe , which is a nice touch .",1
i have always dreamt of climbing to the top but as i suffer with vertigo did n't think it would be possible but i must say a huge thank you to the wonderful male member of staff on the second floor who after a conversation with my son fast tracked us on to the lift to the top .,1
we were searched by security before entering the grounds of the tower .,1
it 's really beautiful .,1
the greatest thing i have ever seen amazing .,1
it cost $ 17 euros and the view is incredible .,1
i finally got on the 2nd elevator to go to the top and it starts to pour with rain .,1
the sheer size of it alone was awe inspiring .,1
visit the tower on night and it s worth the trip .,1
make sure you bring your own food as prices are crazy here .,1
"before i came to paris , i thought tower will not impress me that much , but i was wrong .",1
we waited for 2 people to buy a ticket on the second level .,1
went on a saturday night with lots of music and excitement outside .,1
take the ride to the top in the elevator and spend as much time as you want .,1
view was amazing and definitely worth going with a guide !,1
book through the effiel tower site as other websites charge over the odds .,1
long line but the dinner was the highlight of our stay in paris !,1
once in a life time experience !,1
although it is n't as much as the hype around it is but try getting to unusual spots to take a look at the tower illuminate at night .,1
we decided not to wade through all of the crowds to try to go to the top .,1
"overall , not a show to miss .",1
we waited in a security line for 15 minutes to get into the area near the tower maybe because of the soccer event area they had set up .,1
it will be an experience you will never forget !,1
"this is one of the best places in paris at the eiffel tower , in summer looking up at the 1000 feet tower , want a icon around the world , who dose not love the eiffel tower .",1
we booked a tour from trip advisor for the skip the line tour with summit access .,1
this is the 4th time that i 've seen it & i 'm always delighted .,1
"if you dont like to use the elevator , you can go up using the stairs with its loooots of steps .",1
"so glad that we bought these in advance online , since summit tickets sold out in advance and could not be purchased day of our visit .",1
well worth it.have a look on every floor too .,1
this is 100 % worth it and far exceeded my expectations .,1
view is spectacular from the tower itself and at night from the trocadero .,1
you simply can not .,1
when in paris it 's hart to miss the eiffel tower as it 's visible all over .,1
the lifts are mostly crowded and it took a long time to reach .,1
easy metro restaurant and shipping .,1
do it !!!,1
"the second level is very crowded , but the first level has a lot of space to while away some time .",1
well worth it and much cheaper than tour operators .,1
definitely a once in a lifetime visit,1
highly recommended to be visited specially at night the towers looks amazing with lightning effect,1
you ca n't go to paris and not see the eiffel tower !!,1
altho here can be busy a trip right to the top must be done .,1
another 10 minutes to get into the lift to go up to the 2nd floor .,1
specially came from london to paris for this .,1
its one landmark you can see rising up in the sky from almost anywhere in the main areas of paris .,1
going up was exhilirating but coming from eurodisney we kind of expected more .,1
i love the architecture - very industrial and not polished .,1
this 100 + year old landmark will always have a place in our hearts .,1
"must sees in paris city - montmartre basilique du sacre-coueur , notre dame , louvre , arc de triomphe , tomb of napoleon , jardin des tuileries .",1
an educational and interesting trip with the expected incredible views of the city .,1
this structure is even more impressive in person than in pictures .,1
"the view of the actual tower at night is so romantic , the lights really offset the tower from the rest of the paris skyline and make for some amazing photos .",1
so 5 days later we went up on the most amazing sunny windless day .,1
some people say that if you visit eiffel tower is a symbol of visit paris .,1
one of the most known attractions in the world .,1
we visited the eiffel tower on a rainy day in february and it was still impressive .,1
i spent 7 euro to walk up to the first and second platform which was highly recommended .,1
"one thing to be aware of though is that there are lots of scammers and pickpockets in the area , so keep your hands in your pockets or your valuables in sight .",1
the local newspaper said that the eiffel tower workers went on a pseudo strike for a couple of days because the pick pocketers were barraging the tower grounds in force .,1
"if anything , see it at night when it 's lit and sparkling .",1
i recommend trying to get online tickets before you go but the sell out fast .,1
"arrive early and expect to wait or spend more money and go with a group , either way you 'll need the extra time to take in this amazing structure .",1
the experience of actually going up the tower was so different than i ever imagined .,1
the top sold champagne and has an amazing view .,1
we visited the eiffel tower today and ate in the jules verne restaurant .,1
we went up to the top -lrb- make sure to get your tickets in advance -rrb- and the view was lovely .,1
"the food shops at the second level were mostly closed by 9pm , thus the 4 stars instead of 5 .",1
be sure to visit the top and take lots of pictures from every angle !,1
very impressive up close .,1
there are benches to sit underneath the tower so you can pack a lunch enjoy the site .,1
when asked what was her favourite part of our trip our daughter replied `` the eiffel tower '' .,1
our hotel room having the tower view meant we had a great view of the towers light show which is stunning on the hour from 10pm i believe .,1
"` skip the line ' is actually a service where you meet a guide at a designated spot , then have them lead you past the throng and through security , and finally to the base elevator dedicated for this process .",1
"his passion for this beautiful city and his country pride were clear.very much enjoyed the seine river cruise , very relaxing and a great way to see the city",1
truly beautiful !!,1
the guide niko was excellent .,1
visiting the eiffel tower was a highlight of my visit to paris .,1
definitely recommend booking tickets before you go .,1
we even bought an overpriced glass of champagne each and drank them while enjoying the bird 's eye view of the city .,1
"it was absolutely amazing to be able to see the eiffel tower , of course .",1
at the time of this review tickets are all sold out though november 2015 and most of first 3 weeks in december :-lrb- tickets are only available 3 months from today 's date .,1
"take your time and between the ground , first and second floor you can try the stairs if too many people at the elevators .",1
"i knew it was a tall tower , but words can not convey it until you 're under it looking up .",1
being one of the most recognised tourist attractions it is a must do for any traveller whilst in paris .,1
"we have gone to the top before thankfully , because the queue would have been unbearable",1
it is better to go with an organised trip to take in the tower with other activities as the tickets get you in within minutes of arriving at the attraction rather than queuing .,1
we drank yummy wine .,1
took us a total of 2 1/2 hours to go up and down the tower,1
the last time i saw the tower was from the street at 9pm when the lights came on and they twinkled for 5 minutes making the tower the most beautiful of the sights i have ever seen .,1
it 's the highest place to see the whole city of paris .,1
if you get the chance try it .,1
the most spectacular view of the eiffel tower itself is in the night when the tower is lit up from base to top .,1
"there was some civil work at musee du quai branly field , the area is having bad scenery .",1
"with that said , loved the tower and the view and everything about it .",1
a must do if you 're in paris !,1
"i did not see any pickpockets but i am sure they were around , just watch your stuff closely .",1
"a rusty metal cage thing , that is awful close up , takes 45 minutes to get up there in the lift , as non disabled people were in the queue , and push and shove.once up there the view is beautiful , but the `` gift shop '' , is a complete rip off as is the refreshment stall.been seen it ... wont go again .",1
"unlike climbing cathedrals or domes in europe , it 's open and very airy .",1
a visit to the eiffel tower is a must if you are in paris but the long queues will take the fun and excitement away .,1
"the show at night is so fun when the sparkles come on and the whole crowd cheers , every time .",1
upshot is we decided not to waste time queuing again but enjoy the fantastic views from from where we were .,1
awesome view from the top -lrb- 2nd level -rrb- .,1
the eiffel tower is just beautiful .,1
"it is so beautiful ... magnificent masterpiece.and the view of paris from the tower is just amazing , its a beautiful city.we have to wait in line to get on the top of it but its worth the wait .",1
the option of skip the line booking might be helpful for the tourist in a hurry .,1
"we waited in line to go to the top for maybe 2 hours and when we finally got to purchase our tickets , we were informed we could only go as far as the 2nd floor because they close access to the top at 9pm .",1
"the view is nice enough , as any high point over a great city , but the view of the tower itself is nicer .",1
i ignored her and then watched her and her hustling partner target others .,1
"beware of the long queue though ... for a beautiful shot of the eiffel tower , go to trocadero gardens : -rrb-",1
looks great at night as well - it starts to sparkle around 8pm/8 :30 pm at night .,1
"a good plan at day , night , upstairs , eating inside , with a view of .",1
we came across the tower each day of our 3 day visit .,1
the flickering lights make the eiffel tower come to life .,1
"i highly recommend taking an evening cruise , where u can see the entire city lit up .",1
but it has to be done way ahead the going .,1
"if you want to go on top , you need to buy tickets months in advance .",1
i have always wanted to go to the top and finally made it .,1
with small kids it would have been better perhaps .,1
so i loved the views of the city but felt uneasy the whole time .,1
i hope it was a memorable experience for him .,1
we purchased tix on the official eiffel tower website exactly 90 days before our trip .,1
"the top has two levels , one with plexiglass surrounds and the other open .",1
it is breathtaking to climb and see paris from up top .,1
"but ... when i see the eiffel in front of me , i realized how great is that !",1
go to the top and you will have spectacular view of the beauty of paris !,1
"it was cloudy , but the sun finally showed up before our visit ended .",1
the security is reassuring and quite quick and organised .,1
unmatched views of paris .,1
it gave me goosebumps looking up at the magnificent tower .,1
"then my daughter and i stopped and bought crepes and coffee , just on the other side of the seine , still mesmerized by the sight of the tower .",1
10 minutes walk from the metro .,1
"there is plenty to do on the 1st and 2nd floors , including ice skating !!!",1
what can i say about the tower ?,1
fortunately we did not face any such tragedy .,1
tickets were cheap .,1
spectacular night view of the city at night .,1
keep any bag close to you for security reasons .,1
what can i say that has n't been said ?,1
take the elevator all the way to the top for one of the most spectacular views across this city of light .,1
even more magical than i had imagined .,1
from the outside its magnificence engulfs everything around .,1
the views from the inside of the tour are exquisite !,1
i was able to take a picture of the statue of liberty with the eiffel tower at the back with raindrops on the glass window of the boat .,1
amazing amazing amazing .,1
it is gorgeous at night and the park is full of families and people drinking wine -lrb- there are even wine vendors -rrb- -- as we walked away the tower began twinkling ... such fun .,1
there can be no sight like a fully-lit eiffel tower -lrb- it blinks for about a minute or so every hour ! -rrb-,1
unfortunately i went on a day that was wet .,1
the also open up based on the paris time zone .,1
the hawkers were a nuisance and certainly bag snatching area although the tower security were all over them .,1
"i went in the evening time around 9 and it took less than an hour total to wait in line , buy the tickets , and get to the top of the summit .",1
this is one of my favorite attractions when i visit paris .,1
the worst part of the experience was the hassle you get from the street vendors walking up to the entry points .,1
why would n't folk want to go right to the top if they were going up the eiffel tower anyway ?,1
street food is also available from the market across the road .,1
despite the number of times i have been up the tower it always seems so special .,1
so glad we did as there appeared to be quite the wait for those using the stairs .,1
"it is very crowded and security is more strict than ever , but it is all worth it .",1
definitely a must see .,1
took half day city tour which included brief drive round central paris in coach then dropped at eiffel tower and on to boat cruise .,1
never again until they recrute such people .,1
"the area surrounding the tower is beautiful with lots of places to sit in the park and just look at the view , if your going to paris it is a must to go here .",1
"i have to search for way down , anxiety plus .",1
went in about 7pm and only had to wait in both the security and ticket queue for a total of ~ 40 mins which was fine .,1
"on the way up we bought the vip pass , was ok the guid was really helpful .",1
vies and atmosphere amazing admission not cheap,1
we arrived without reservations an in about an hour and a half we were at the summit .,1
they let us go up early .,1
i 'm not going to sugarcoat this : i was terrified that i 'd have to go find the american embassy and i did n't have my passport on me .,1
warning though the trip up can be nerve-wracking for anyone afraid of heights .,1
and of course if you are visiting paris you have to visit the tower .,1
unfortunately didnt go at night time to see it lit up which i 've been told is amazing !,1
we did this on a sunday morning .,1
simply amazing experience and value .,1
this visit in july the whole base area was fenced off and was a secured area .,1
"be it the view from its summit or the view of tower itself , we just cant get our eyes of it !",1
you can take the subway but its definitely better to walk you get excellent views and different angles during the walk .,1
visited the eiffel tower whilst doing a hop on .,1
hop off boat trip around paris .,1
"i always dreamt of seeing the eiffel , but i had to actually pinch myself when i finally saw it in person .",1
visited paris with our team of international vedanta society from european countries .,1
"the kids were awestruck , and it was a wonderful experience for all !",1
make sure you see it on the hour att night when the lights sparkle .,1
beware a beer is $ 15 euros .,1
inspiring .,1
when i reached paris and saw eiffel from far away while in cab i was little disappointed .,1
"if you can , go to the top on a clear day and see the city of light from different sides .",1
"great to see this iconic sight , we went first thing in the morning and the queues were n't too long .",1
long queues for everything .,1
your phones and cameras too get stolen if you are not careful .,1
visited the eiffel tower early evening in april 2016 and it was super crowded .,1
purchased our tickets to the top online before we left the states .,1
my 11-year-old and i are both freaked out by heights but we rode to the tippy top and the view was glorious !,1
"we visited end of afternoon and enjoyed the top view with the sunlight , then the sunrise and the night light .",1
"well , what do you expect when you visit paris ?",1
it 's breath taking and for sure you need to stay some time !,1
i was really surprised by the sheer scale of the tower - its huge !,1
cafeteria poor & slow when it should be 1st class .,1
"you are charged more the further up you go in the tower , and since i 'd been to the top before i chose only to go to the second level .",1
rode elevator to the top and enjoyed wonderful views .,1
it is a must see in paris,1
"online tickets may be gone a month before you travel , so buy well in advance .",1
i did n't look much on the way up but the views are amazing when you get there even though it was a bit windy .,1
witnessed the light show in the tower and bought souvenirs in the gift shop .,1
"however , it is beautiful when lit up at night ; then it looks like a proper romantic attraction .",1
"it was n't popular with the parisians when built , but seems to be accepted as part of the culture now .",1
"if not , you will stand in line for hours -lrb- honest -rrb- to try and get a no-show ticket or stand in line for hours to walk up .",1
this impressive tower is without a doubt paris icon .,1
you can buy tickets in advance but i do n't recommend paying the extra fees .,1
"i visited eiffel tower during my two days trip to paris and just loved it , the view is spectacular .",1
"view of the tower from below , from the earth the glorious , but the view from the top is amazing .",1
also go up the top for a breathtaking view of the whole paris city .,1
i believe that this is the best part of the paris visit for any tourist .,1
"it was a clear day , so the views were excellent .",1
i felt safe with my pickpocket proof pants from clothing arts .,1
there is a lift that will take you up the eiffel tower which is good .,1
i passed on security check point and was queued for nearly 2 hour when -lrb- after buying ticket -rrb- i was told the padlock on my bag -lrb- to keep it safe from pick pockets -rrb- was not allowed .,1
unfortunately there can be large crowds of tourists - and watch out for pickpockets .,1
a visit to paris would be incomplete without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"the line with a prepaid is still long , but substantially less than those trying to buy same day .",1
loved it here !,1
"did not pay to go up , more than satisfied viewing from ground .",1
we were there easter week and right before the paris marathon so the crowds and security were heightened .,1
i would n't linger too long below the tower .,1
i did n't try going to the summit but the second floor was more than enough .,1
not more than 1 hour waiting line .,1
i 'm so pleased my husband convinced me to go up the eiffel tower i felt such an achievement by doing so and the views are incredible .,1
what an excellent experience !,1
"it was so much fun and i would recommend to the adventurous ones to take the stairs -lrb- you have to take the elevator if you want to go to the 3rd -rrb- , there 's so much to see on the way up and down .",1
we traveled to the top one time and another time we ate in the lower restaurant .,1
during both times the views are spectacular !,1
"its hard to find parking and if you do , its a maximum of 2 hours on a parking ticket and those 2 hours get spent up you being in the que .",1
"we beat this by having the computer ready to go and payment cards out and ready , so when they opened for sale we could jump right on and get the times we wanted .",1
amazing !!!,1
the atmosphere surroundings alone are worth a trip .,1
"there is a lovely sitting area up there , with a bar/cafes dotted around and of course gift shop .",1
eiffel tower simply evokes a romantic background for a couple or family photo .,1
"the sunset view was very special , but crowded .",1
"yes , it is very touristy .",1
day or night it 's one of the best sites to go see in paris .,1
great food and even better views .,1
if the weather is warm i 'd advise on a hat and plenty of water .,1
you can easily get away from the crowd if you look hard enough while still enjoying its grandeur .,1
"during the day it is not that impressive , but as nightfall hits .",1
the views from the tower are incredible .,1
"i 'll be back in paris on may 9 , 2017 and i 'm going to go up then .",1
however it 's worth that !!!,1
we had lunch at the tower great views and surprisingly great food .,1
this was our first visit to paris and the eiffel tower was first in the list .,1
"it 's a tower , nothing amazing about it .",1
ticket line -lrb- once on site -rrb- was exactly on hour long -lrb- north entrance -rrb- .,1
absolutely beautiful to see the tower lit up at night !,1
"all in all , ca n't explain the beauty of the place , the nice people and the amazing views",1
even if you do not goo up the tower their is still plenty to do and see .,1
i did n't try to climb this time .,1
wobbly fencing everywhere to keep the paid entry folks apart from those wandering outside .,1
we have visited eiffel tower in mar 2017 .,1
a must do for all .,1
"we purchased advance tickets as part of a tour , so we walked right up and got right in .",1
one of the most visited monuments in the world with a fantastic view from the top is a true beauty in paris .,1
prebought tickets gets you in a shorter line .,1
the queuing systems are poor though .,1
i visited the eiffel tower on a nice and sunny day so there were lots of people queuing up for tickets .,1
just wow !!!!,1
bad choice,1
i have done it on every trip to paris and this trip was no exception !,1
"karen , our guide was good but was not very accurate with all the technical facts .",1
when the tower sparkled it was a sight to see amazing we were on a river cruise and the setting is stunning,1
"to be fair to the people of paris , i think there are just so many visitors that they can not keep up .",1
lots of sellers in the street but they were n't pushy so could not complain .,1
from each floor opens really beautiful view of paris .,1
"plus , the lights made it easy to find the landmarks around the city .",1
enjoy the view of the tower ... .,1
almost all visitors to paris make the eiffel tower a ` must see ' .,1
you can buy a glass of champagne -lrb- or all kinds of other snacks -rrb- to have while you take in the amazing view !!,1
i learned it was originally to be temporary .,1
the view from the eiffel tower is worth every penny .,1
"we had not so much time to visit the tower -lrb- about 1 hour - thank god , i bought the tickets online ! -rrb-",1
very special trip to the top at 4pm .,1
but it is worth going up once .,1
they are all over the grounds and are scamming you for money .,1
but due to glass i could not feel the wind speed .,1
my favorite level was the first level that you go to in your way back down .,1
we bought,1
"admire notre-dame , sacré-coeur , and other parisian icons from above .",1
seeing this architectural wonder for the first time was truly awe-inspiring .,1
spring is definitely a better time for the whole experience .,1
"we went to see the eiffel tower at night to see it lit up on our first night in paris , it was a beautiful sight .",1
"climbed the stairs to the first level since we were limited on time , we did n't want to wait in the que for the lift access .",1
you should see eiffel tower both during the and day and after sunset .,1
however do n't let this put you off just be aware .,1
it was an amazing experience with the glittering lights that came on every hour .,1
"for this trip , we purchased ` skip the line ' tickets online from viator before we traveled .",1
paris is such a beautiful city and having 360 views from the top of an iconic landmark was incredible .,1
but be aware that there are ungodly long lines .,1
you will see whole of paris sparkling .,1
totally worth climbing it even though it was very tiring .,1
they were relentless and we counted being approached by over 20 different men during our visit to the eiffel tower .,1
it is a high metal structure and the view from the top is stunning and breathtaking especially at night .,1
"lots of photo opportunities , food vendors everywhere .",1
"since we were n't able to see the eiffel at night , we came another day and look from afar and it 's still beautiful .",1
i gave my wife the money and she carried on queueing for another 20 minutes .,1
it was my third time in paris and i finally took a deep breath and faced the tour eiffel .,1
"we were met by our local tour guide as soon as we got off the bus and were showed to the prepaid , vip line .",1
next time !!,1
"only negative was some of the views were spoilt by the euro 2016 fanzone under the tower , but guess that 's just bad timing and it will all be away in a matter of weeks .",1
i thought going up one tier is good enough than paying more and going further up .,1
definitely a sunny day activity .,1
if you do plan on going you need to plan extra time for the security checks,1
light show spectacular,1
"you can climb to the 2nd floor , and enjoy the panoramic view of the city , or you can climb to the top of the highest building in paris , to the height of 280m .",1
"we were offered drugs to buy -lrb- we declined -rrb- the last time we were there , so beware if you have teenagers or children going with you .",1
the eiffel tower is one of those things -- like the grand canyon or taj mahal -- that can not be captured in pictures -- one must see it .,1
one of the best views is from the arc !,1
thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the view .,1
the effil tower is the central spot to see all of paris .,1
see paris and die .,1
we got to the top about 30 min before sunset and stayed for a couple hours .,1
"in my opinion , the best place to view this engineering masterpiece is from trocadéro .",1
"eiffel tower is 324 m -lrb- 1,063 ft -rrb- tall and is the tallest structure in paris .",1
"its the go to attraction , just stand there and admire it you wont regret it and we should all experience once at least .",1
we also enjoyed viewing at night time - just beautiful !,1
the view from the second level is breathtaking .,1
the twinkling lights are worth the extra trip !!,1
and it sparkles so very very beautifully .,1
the good security check to go the top was great idea .,1
everyone worked so very hard to make this experience a `` once-in-a-lifetime event '' .,1
it is one of the wonders of the modern world .,1
"having visited here on 3 occasions , the first time i went up to the 2nd floor , the second and third time , i made sure i was up to the top .",1
a suit and tie are not required .,1
"there is no charge to walk the grounds where the eiffel tower is located , but a fee for the elevator to ascend .",1
-lrb- which i have already visited ... view is from a lower point .,1
queued for about an hour .,1
not even long ones .,1
an amazing experience .,1
on the hour the tower twinkled which was beautiful and fun for filming/photos .,1
"just enjoy looking at it while you eat , if you can afford it eat at the restaurant at the top of the tower .",1
"it will probably the only time i go up , as i 've decided it 's much more majestic from the ground .",1
it was my first time in france ... and it was definitely worthwhile !,1
so good so amazing so beautiful great place to be me and my friends visited the eiffel and it was really mesmerising all the way to the top ... even the restaurant on the 2nd level was super .,1
it truly is the heart of paris !,1
it 's one of the most well known landmarks and truly puts paris on the map .,1
"tower eiffel offers some of the best views of the city , you have clear views in all directions .",1
the eiffel tower is one of those iconic landmarks that is on everyone 's ` must see ' lists - and it does n't disappoint !,1
you will still encounter lines for the elevators to the first and second level and the second elevators to the summit .,1
"personally however , i would leave that to the other tourists - the best way to see the tower is looking directly at it .",1
"great place , 17 $ pp ... guess you only do it once .",1
you could buy tickets online to avoid queues but we decided not to as we wanted to go with the flow .,1
i got a better view of paris from my hotel room .,1
classic paris sight seeing .,1
take night photos too .,1
"you not only skip the massive lines , you hear the story of the tower itself and how it meshes with french history .",1
it is just beautiful .,1
we were packed in body to body on a hot autumn night which was not only creepy but uncomfortable .,1
the sheer size of the tower is breathtaking !,1
"very crowed , but worth the hassle , special paris spot",1
"so amazing to see it up against the blue sky , will have dinner there later in the week , many tourist , go early if you do n't want to wait in line",1
it simply has a different feeling .,1
beautiful from all views .,1
"i have been to the tower many times and i have always enjoyed the amazing feat of engineering that must have gone into the building of the structure , on this occasion it was good to see the tower even though it was raining hard .",1
we could n't get tickets online before we went to paris .,1
"it is not inexpensive , but i can not think of a more spectacular view in paris .",1
it was a cheap alternative to buying an expensive tour .,1
"for a fee , you can take a ride up the tower to enjoy a view if that 's what you are into .",1
we were planning on visiting the eiffel tower in the morning to beat the queues but decided instead to visit late at night and we were very pleased that we did .,1
we visited during holiday season and it was very overcrowded .,1
went on a sunday .,1
the new 1st floor with the glass floor is a challenge one must try ; -rrb-,1
went on the 9am tour and we were able to quickly get a ticket to the third level .,1
along with wonderful and bright sky this is a wonderful sight not to miss,1
champagne bar at the top was wonderful !,1
"once you get to the first and second levels , you can look at the fantastic views , but not while climbing the steps .",1
suck up the cost !,1
in the evening it 's shimmering .,1
"on the way across the atlantic , hubby says `` oh , god , did you feel that bump ?",1
even without going up the tower its a great experience and the best time to visit is in the night when the lights come on and the sparkling lights every one hour when the dull bronze tower gets a life of its own !!,1
on the second level we discovered we needed to buy another ticket to get to the summit so joined another queue to buy the ticket from a ticket booth on the 2nd level .,1
"if you have the time , take the elevator to the top and enjoy the views over paris .",1
the majesty of the tower is enhanced with the presence of river seine at its base and its gardens champs de mars,1
"we still had to wait about 30 minutes just to get past security , and another 30 to take the elevator up .",1
"you wait in a line to go in elevators , bathrooms , etc. it was really cold !",1
i recommended suffering through the lines and sardine-like feeling to get to the top .,1
especially if u go all the way up and it 's in the evening when the lights are on .,1
we opted for the summit option to get to the you of the tower by lift .,1
the ride up to the top is smooth and easy to navigate .,1
"highly recommend 58 tour eiffel restaurant - the views are sensational , the staff are extremely friendly and charming .",1
definitely book a tour ahead so you can learn the history and quirky facts as well as avoid the lines and get through security faster .,1
to get the best photos go across the street to trocadero .,1
my friends and i were very excited to go up top on glass elevator .,1
the tour offered insights you just would n't receive if you viewed the tower on your own .,1
"even though i hate heights , i could n't miss out on a trip to the top of the eiffel tower , and i 'm glad i did n't chicken out !",1
"we did n't have advanced reservations so we only got to the second level , which is honestly still pretty high up in my opinion .",1
the last floor you are unable to take the stairs and forced to take the elevator .,1
the area was very crowded with tourists and maybe even more so because it was during euro cup time .,1
get tickets in advance .,1
the view is difference day and night .,1
the lift is very unique because it ascends slanted unlike other lifts that ascend upwards .,1
"this is probably the most iconic things in paris , and therefore something i thought had to be seen .",1
so much has been written and said about the eiffel tower that i was fairly complacent about going .,1
had no idea i would enjoy seeing all of paris so much .,1
we visited the eiffel tower both at day and night .,1
there is a separate entrance for guests with reservations for your first security scan .,1
it 's difficult to get around when there are so many people but the tower is a beauty .,1
do n't miss the twinkling lights every hour from i believe 8pm-1am .,1
the tower is beautiful for any corner of paris .,1
"security comfortingly tight , a suspect package was detonated below us in a manner suggesting a daily occurrence .",1
as expected the eiffel tower did not disappoint .,1
", considering all the queues you should reserve 2-3 hours -lrb- 3-4 if you are buying the tickets at the spot -rrb- for this attraction .",1
just go and enjoy the views from all angles .,1
"sure it 's touristy and always crowded , but you have to do it .",1
"there are plenty of people hocking nonsense across the street , which is how we got there from the metro station .",1
we were unable to get tickets to the elevators and the lines were very long .,1
its really worth to go during the say and night .,1
"tickets can be purchased online , but you must do it sufficiently in advance .",1
i recommend getting a skip the queue ticket .,1
up close it is enormous and you can not see the entire tower unless move away fr/it about 1/8 -1 / 4 mile .,1
my family and i went to paris and were amazed at the beauty of the tower .,1
prices are not worth what you get and would not visit again .,1
"we visited the tower at 8pm in paris on my birthday , and boy were we delighted we did !",1
very crowded and queues are too long .,1
the additional cost is worth it .,1
nice little cafes nearby along the seine for crepes or pizza .,1
this was my first time visiting the eiffel tower during the summer and was really surprised by the crowds .,1
"we went at 10 a.m. on a sunday morning and the lines were n't bad , but we got to skip the regular line because of our advance tickets .",1
with the current situation the security takes over an hour .,1
yes it 's cliché and so very touristy .,1
anxiety now reaches it 's greatest level .,1
this should be explained and sold separately on the ground .,1
it 's an amazing sight seeing .,1
souvenir shop and food available at each level .,1
"take a trip to the top , the view is awesome .",1
"our family thoroughly enjoyed the eiffel tower however , we purchased a viator skip the line summit pass - small group for $ 362 and it was such as waste of money .",1
the eiffel tower is the best way to get your bearings in paris - we were so glad we went there early in our visit .,1
"there is also a upper level , which costs 7 $ extra .",1
"after having booked our tickets online - which avoided us having to wait endlessly - we visited this unique landmark , offering an incredible view of the city .",1
"great architectural feat , and a feast for the eye .",1
there are gift shops and eating area .,1
to view fireworks display on eiffel tower on 14th july with a decent view is quite tricky .,1
one of the most iconic sights in the whole world and a must see for any visitor to paris - le tour d'eiffel .,1
parking available nearby .,1
the ticket to go to the top must be purchased ahead of time - expect to wait in line for the elevator .,1
the eiffel tower is one cliche tourist hot spot we really enjoyed .,1
we did not get there before it opened .,1
"up top , the view was not that obstructed so that was fine but it was windy and wet !!",1
a famous site visited by tourists .,1
a glass of champagne on the top is a must .,1
the views are stunning from all levels on the tower .,1
a beautiful sight,1
it is so much bigger than i imagined .,1
the sparking lights come on for about 5 minutes at the top of the hour after dark .,1
everywhere you go on the grounds there are thieves and pickpockets masquerading as people taking a survey .,1
there 's lots to do around here .,1
"no matter how many pictures you 've seen of the eiffel tower , it 's a completely different feeling to be standing under its mighty structure and to take in the stupendous views from the top !",1
it is awesome to see at night all light up .,1
"highly recommended to purchase tickets in advance , else you will spend 1-2 hours in the queue .",1
once you get to the 3rd floor - you will see a wonderful and unforgettable view of the city .,1
so memorable and fun !,1
it is indeed a unique experience .,1
if i ever moved to paris i would want to be in the vicinity of this great sight .,1
at night the lights go on and it is something everyone must see in their lifetime !,1
buy your tickets in advance and enjoy the view .,1
hopefully you are not scared of heights .,1
and understandably so .,1
we both agree it was !,1
we prebooked dinner in the restaurant on the first level and so skipped the queue .,1
if you do n't like the eiffel tower then you should still go - from the top it 's the only place in paris that you get a view of the city without the eiffel tower in it !!,1
"also , if you are planning to visit the tower only once then prefer the evening .",1
it is a definite must see in person !,1
"however , if you do n't want to spend the money on the tour , then buy a bring a drink and chill by the lawn to wait for the twinkling lights of the eiffels to light up .",1
"the gift shops were brilliant , and good quality souvenirs !",1
"the queue for the lift to the top took around 20-30 minutes , however , the views compensate for the wait .",1
we were able to skip the line and get right to the top .,1
"even thought he menu is limited , the food was very good .",1
this was our first stop in paris and it does not disappoint !,1
view from top most floor is marvellous .,1
first time to paris so had to go to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
"there 's not a lot of history to the et , read about it online and that 's the tour narrative .",1
"since this was low season , only a minimal wait for entry and not super crowded .",1
the crowds were just massive .,1
i would recommend that you purchase your tickets months in advance of your trip .,1
security was tight -lrb- understandably -rrb- but was friendly enough .,1
views of paris were tremendous .,1
the light effects were mesmerizing !!!!!,1
but the tower is so magnificent .,1
we felt some of the bare as below walking to the river were just junk food stalls for the tourists however every where in paris is wonderful to be .,1
my favorite spot in the world !,1
eiffel tower is astounding .,1
lonnnnnng lines .,1
"on the way through the park to the tower , watch out for girls wanting you to give money and sign a petition they are thieves and pickpockets , we were approached a few times ... .",1
it 's quite magical viewing it from champ de mars,1
reaching the summit makes you wonder how they made it happen those days .,1
if you go to paris and do n't see eiffel tower then you have surely wasted your trip .,1
very romantic to get a blanket and sit on the grass under the tower .,1
the doors opened at 9.30 prompt and the queue moved fast .,1
i would recommend getting tickets in advance as the lines can be long .,1
"of course you have to see the eiffel tower when in paris , but wow , it 's even more spectacular in real life .",1
"we walked up the stairs to avoid the long lines , great choice , it is an easy climb .",1
la complete panoramic view of paris !!,1
the park under le tour eiffel was my favorite place on a sunny day .,1
not much more to say -- a once in a lifetime must do .,1
went to the very top of the tower and it was just awesome .,1
like everyone else you 'll just have to accept the throngs and the street vendors - the price of modern mass tourism .,1
"elevator took you to 2nd level , and another elevator took you to the third level with a 20 minute wait in line .",1
only 11.50 $ to go to the top level .,1
bring lots of money .,1
we finally can get reserved tickets by joining package tour through the tourist office .,1
views are beautiful and we were at the top for sun set .,1
"there are local grocery shops that sell pre-made sandwiches , salads , etc. which can be brought to the park .",1
we did n't pay to go right to the very top .,1
"if you can only go once , i 'd recommend going at night .",1
they provide a guide from their office to the entry point who gives you information on tour eiffel .,1
stunning when up their and must go all the way to the top .,1
amazing views over paris especially at night .,1
it was cold and raining off and on so we decided to get crepes with nutella a short walk from there .,1
ordering tickets in advance is highly recommended .,1
took the tour to the top & was so glad we did .,1
"while there may be ore detail from the lower vantage point , the view from the top is never ending and glorious !",1
"historial an typical structure , a must in paris .",1
third floor was closed in winter .,1
cheaper than third party online tickets,1
i am not that keen on large crowds of people so i did n't attempt to go up in the tower .,1
the building is incredible and the views are so great .,1
from the moment you stand at the bottom it is overwhelming !,1
"if the weather is not good , especially foggy , it might be covered .",1
"would we go again , probably not .",1
catch the sparkling lights in the evening at every hour .,1
it was chilly but the views took our breath away .,1
pls take the skip the line ticket to avoid the rush .,1
there are 3 levels .,1
my advice is if you want amazing pictures with the tower go to trocadero if i 'm not mistaken its just to stops on the metro .,1
always get the skip-the-line ticket if you can .,1
truly impressive spot and worth the headaches to experience .,1
watch your bag up here .,1
it was wonderful they do a light show with the tower once every hour at night and its truly amazing .,1
it 's amazing !,1
"there are parks around eiffel where you can click pictures , relax and just enjoy the ambiance .",1
"it 's definitely a must see when visiting paris , but i do n't recommend going up the tower in a cold windy day , we could n't stand 2 minutes outside and appreciate the view because of the cold weather .",1
make sure you go after dark when it sparkles every hour !,1
"i 'm giving it four stars because if you go during tourist season , the view from the montmartre cathedral is almost as impressive and you do n't have to queue up for hours .",1
the only way it would be better is to go at night .,1
i miss paris !,1
maybe next time i would but a ticket but have heard / been recommended to go to norte dam cathedral instead for view of city,1
"dont get me wrong , if you visit paris , you have to visit eiffel 's tower , but the queueing ... oh the queueing ...",1
i think that i might have had a different experience it i had to navigate crowds and wait for a long time for the elevator to the top .,1
nice views and weather in november .,1
well worth getting !,1
"i believe that 99 % if not 100 % of people who comes to paris have come to this iconic place , is it amazing ?",1
also we never found the toilets despite numerous signs .,1
we went by day and had a tour by night which was by far the better experience .,1
"recommend purchasing tickets before hand , this will safe a long time on queuing .",1
"bought the tickets directly there , the price is reasonable .",1
i was very happy with our decision to do this tour and it was one that was not very expensive so shop around .,1
"a lot of people approach you trying to sell keyrings , magnets ect but dont purchase off them you will find better quality in the actual stalls and even cheaper away from the eiffel tower .",1
"the first line is for the lift to get to the middle level , the second line is for the lift to get to the top .",1
"if you just want to go to second level , i would recommend going to the south pier as the queues were much shorter .",1
you can even feel the tower moving while your stood admiring the entire city and beyond .,1
it has long been on our bucket list .,1
it 's a must to purchase the tickets to go all the way to the top .,1
book on line to insure an elevator ride,1
i was disappointed that there was such a line to even walk under the tower .,1
you will be able to capture some breathtaking photos of the arc de triomphe or notre-dame cathedral enjoys drink against the stunning parisian backdrop .,1
"this time around i was n't aware that was an option , i highly recommend it because the lines are so long .",1
one further security check later and we almost immediately boarded the lift to the second stage .,1
hope this helps .,1
and view from third floor was amazing .,1
"it is beautiful at night , and they turn on additional lights and make it `` sparkle '' hourly at night .",1
i ca n't say which time i liked more but i did love the lights going off in the evening on the hour .,1
the bad stuff that happened in recent history scared folks off from paris .,1
"we took a trip to the top just before closing time -lrb- between 10 - 11pm -rrb- , so the crowds had thinned a bit and the lineup was tolerable .",1
the eiffel tower is such a historic land mark and is something i advise everyone to see at some point in life .,1
the french staff could see the issue and did n't help .,1
100 % worth the experience !!!,1
you can also skip the line by either making a reservation at the jules verne restaurant or pre-purchasing a ticket online reserved for a particular time .,1
i did not try the bar and restaurant at the top .,1
"we spent only about 15 minutes in line for tickets and less at the elevators , going straight to the top first .",1
i climbed the 700 or so steps to the 2nd floor and then took an elevator to the top !,1
"the view from the top is , obviously , stunning .",1
"our wait in the line for the elevator was about 30 minutes , but once up there , we could spend as long as we wanted enjoying this spectacular view .",1
it worse a litte bit of you time !,1
my first trip tio paris was truly unforgetabble .,1
it 's like she could n't be bothered to deal with us as we did n't speak french .,1
"could n't get tickets online ahead of time -lrb- buy super early -rrb- , but we so enjoyed the free views walking around close up and from a distance .",1
another long queue .,1
i do n't know if they still allow it now though for security reasons .,1
it was one of the most magical destinations i have ever experienced .,1
it was a rainy day but still wonderful .,1
even though it was throwing it down and windy the eiffel tower was architecturally stunning and the views from the top super : the whole of paris is laid before you .,1
"it seems better if you will visit this place in night time , i.e after 9:30 pm .",1
go during the day and at night .,1
the tower lights up on the hour every hour when it 's dark .,1
visited the first level restaurant as part of a package tour from pariscityvision that included a night river cruise and late show at the moulin rouge .,1
i visited the tower a while back but it has forever remained an amazing memory for me .,1
"a definitely dream come true for me , make sure to visit during day and night as its really stunning !",1
the ticket office opened at 9.30 and we were the first ones to purchase tickets and begin our climb .,1
"eiffel tower is something to fall in love with , no matter you see that in daylight or at night .",1
how can you review the icon that is le tour eiffel ?,1
for the best views i recommend going across the street to trocadéro .,1
"great views were had , the food was well done considering the number of people they would have to get through in a lunch break .",1
the eiffel tower is a must if you are visiting paris .,1
for the stairs we waited maybe 30 minutes .,1
looked even better seeing it up close definitely worth a view .,1
great view from the 3rd floor .,1
"this wondrous structure way exceeded my expectations , wow that thing is impressive !",1
"in the line ups we were pushed and shoved with people throwing elbows , it was manic !",1
"you 'll get the most amazing picture , its super romantic and the view from top is amazing .",1
day or night it is great .,1
"we went pretty early in the morning , so the lines were n't to bad .",1
i went multiple times .,1
"do go up , take stairs and enjoy the views .",1
the views at night are also stunning .,1
what else is there to say about the eiffel tower ?,1
tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues .,1
plastic glasses but still lots of fun .,1
get there early .,1
standing in line for couple of hours & then bearing the chill .,1
great restaurant on the ist level .,1
a place you must visit when you are in paris .,1
although it 's packed you should do it !,1
decided to go up at night to enjoy the spectacular scene of paris at night .,1
we went on a monday so the queue was not too bad and only waited around 30 minutes .,1
i enjoy walking the stairs up to the 1st and 2nd level .,1
"off we went , but the downside was that it was raining .",1
the most beautiful sightseeing in paris .,1
the eiffel tower now features a see-through section making up part of the first stage .,1
seeing the eiffel tower at night as we approached paris by car at night was one of the best moments of our trip .,1
a must do just because .,1
i never put my phone in a pocket .,1
went with a travel company that herds you in past the lines .,1
"it 's not always easy to get tickets , but try to plan ahead , it 's worth the effort .",1
we came late at night to avoid the crowds .,1
from reading reviews on here before going we knew what to expect with crowds and how long the queues would be .,1
"yes , we had to get on-line for about an hour -lrb- which is not that bad when you think about how long you need to wait on-line at sixflags for a ride that lasts a minute -rrb- .",1
"the number of visitors is handled efficiently , and if you 're lucky the highest deck will be open .",1
i arrived at 9.30 am and waited in line for 30mins when i left about 11 the line had tripled .,1
"maybe you have seen tons of pictures from other people on the internet/book , but when you are actually at the bottom , it 's still amazing .",1
"instead , collect a french picnic -lrb- baguette , cheese , some meats , fruit ... -rrb- and sit on the peaceful grass and enjoy the view !",1
"the topmost level definitely feels scary , you ears pop on your way down .",1
then after all that we had to wait again about 35 min just to get down again we would have walked but the stairs were closed for some reason .,1
you can also walk up or down from the first and second levels .,1
i personally thought that the eiffel tower a very good experience .,1
we were warned of huge queues and long waits to take the lift up but we probably only had 45 minutes from the end of queue to getting the lift .,1
"worth the wait , what a view .",1
it was very crowded as i went in the holiday season and had to be very careful because of all the pickpockets around .,1
we got in line to get tickets for the summit .,1
but we were extremely pleased with the 2nd level .,1
we took the cable car/lift down !,1
"eat there if you wish , it certainly wo n't be the worst experience and the view is first rate .",1
"so many people who visit paris look at the guide books and queue for entry early in the morning , from 8am , so you still end up in a huge line .",1
watch out for the pick pocket people asking if you speak english carrying a clip board .,1
"the views are magnificent , the museum fun , and the ride up and sown amazing .",1
"there are many people selling things on the street , great for souvenirs .",1
we arrived at 10 and could gothrough immediately .,1
"climbing up to the 2nd level by stairs was a great experience , i would highly recommend it .",1
although is a very beautiful and impressive construction ... you have to see it during the night !,1
"the restaurant is nice , nothing special",1
"things to get off the bucket list , a must to experience that 's all .",1
the view was amazing from all the levels .,1
visited eiffel tower this month and it is breathtaking .,1
sunset or night time is definitely the best time to see the tower .,1
you can not miss the visit of eiffel tower in your life .,1
take in the sights and relax .,1
obviously there are a lot of tourists and queueing so i recomment you do this activity in the morning to avoid the crowds .,1
45 mins/1 hour to get on the lift - unless you want to walk up ! -rrb-,1
"visited on a cold , gray , snowy-rainy kind day so did not go up ; however , it was awesome .",1
if you are in paris you must go to the eiffel tower .,1
i very much recommend seeing it at night because it 's beautifully lit and i believe it sparkles on the hour -lrb- i was there at 11pm on the dot so i 'm assuming it happens hourly -rrb- .,1
security is extremely prevalent in this area .,1
should explore the top of eiffel tower and the view around .,1
whenever you se it you ` ll enjoy it .,1
there were swarms of law enforcement and military personnel everywhere .,1
restaurant requires reservation .,1
"an energy saving move by the french government , but a nice one as it says goodnight paris in such a lovely way .",1
"make sure to put it on your list , and not just drive by - worth the time !",1
the architecture is such that even if you visit after few years its amazing .,1
it 's a great vantage spot around sunset and watch the tower when it is lit up .,1
we visited last weekend and there was lots of security and loads of ques .,1
"must do when in paris ... impressive construction , great history .",1
"i felt like a child , i was so excited to see and stand in front of such a world famous piece of architecture .",1
"we have been to paris several times , and we always visit the eiffel tower .",1
it was a sunny day .,1
stay clear .,1
try to pre-book -lrb- online -rrb- your tickets well in advance to avoid the queues .,1
why go to paris if not to see this iconic structure .,1
"it is an impressive tower , both from afar and close up .",1
excellent experience and an breath taking view from top ... i love to come back again .,1
"coffee shop and souvenir shops on second floor level - coffee and cakes much cheaper than i expected , given that we were in one of the top tourist destinations , worldwide .",1
what an extra ordinary structure made by man .,1
nice view of paris .,1
`` skip the line tour '' .,1
however the food when compared to the very expensive price per person was a disappointment .,1
"but put up with the lines and the hoards of people crowded at the base , not to mention the tourist junk , i mean souvenir , vendors and pickpockets ?",1
it was cool and rainy so i 'm not sure if that was a factor or that there were less tourists .,1
this does n't echo the elegance of paris and physically barricades the citizens of paris from walking close to their tower .,1
we were there in august and about 9pm when the lights first come on it was lit in gold with the addition of silver sparkling lights for about 10 minutes .,1
fresh !,1
i was told that the eiffel tower is overrated and nothing but a hunk of steel.it 's all lies .,1
"waiting for the two elevators was n't bad either , but i can see how people spend all day waiting to get to the ` summit ' .",1
"be careful around the park at the bottom at night , lots of vendors selling cheap trinkets .",1
the day that we were there only the north tower was open for tickets and for those already with tickets .,1
my second visit to the eiffel tower and i went to the second floor which offers a great view of paris .,1
a few of the boat tours along the seine depart close by as well .,1
the views from the top were amazing .,1
"we saw it both in daylight and night , but did n't touch it , mostly from a distance , to crowded and expensive",1
"if you are not worried about heights , this is a must-do in paris , but be prepared to queue with all the other tourists .",1
"we were able to find a couple spots where the tower was visible through the trees without a million people in our way , and our friend was loving it , so it worked out .",1
security bag checks .,1
you can climb the tower but be ready for long lines .,1
terrible service and we still had to wait about a half an hour even though we paid $ 60/person for skip-the-line tickets .,1
we went up the tower on a rainy evening .,1
a must see if it 's your first time to paris .,1
the area around is very nice and open .,1
"people exercising , hanging out with friends , walking their dogs , it was really nice .",1
it was a great location because it 's in the heart of the neighborhood so we hot to enjoy the places where the locals go and hang out .,1
ca n't say enough of how majestic and awe-inspiring this piece of history is .,1
a tour to the top is absolutely worth the money .,1
big mistake !,1
"overtaken in height by today 's great towers , it nevertheless remains unique .",1
it 's an sneezing place .,1
next to us a child gave up his french flag .,1
"if you really want to go up tour eiffel , climb the stairs on foot .",1
we walked down all the steps pretty concerned but got to the bottom and the lifts were going up as normal .,1
"i took the elevator up and the stairs down , though i do n't really recommend this if you are afraid of heights -lrb- lots of stairs -rrb- .",1
"floor , at half the price of what it costs on the top floor .",1
you 'll be amazed when you see it at night .,1
small group and we did indeed skip the lines !,1
the eiffel tower is of course crowed and touristy but its an essential part of visiting paris !,1
but even so glad to say i 've been ...,1
now also with glass floors .,1
"line ups were ok , went fairly quick .",1
this building is huge and seeing it from a distance does n't do it justice .,1
"we went to see the eiffel tower late afternoon which is optimal because you get there , view the tower during the daylight , and as the afternoon progresses you get to view the tower at night .",1
great place to visit the views from the top of paris are amazing and at night the tower is lit up and the ligt show is good,1
would highly recommend to anyone that is considering going a must do whilst in paris .,1
down sides also as you 'd expect - lots of street sellers flogging naff souvenirs and con artist cup games etc. .,1
by day with the crowds & queues it 's manic !,1
make sure you pre-book your tickets in order to shorten your waiting time .,1
spectacular views of the city .,1
"go as high up as you can , the views across the city are unbeatable ... .",1
about 5-10 minutes walk .,1
"my wife and i visited the eiffel tower in august , 2015 and had an absolutely wonderful time .",1
on the day we met the agent at the north tower on the grass near the pavement facing the river .,1
the staff were very nice,1
"we jumped the long queues for tickets as i am disabled , you can book in advance to avoid queues too.we only went to 2nd floor as it was too windy to go higher , the views and scale of it were amazing .",1
the view was brilliant but unfortunately due to weather we could n't go to the summit .,1
i just loved the eiffel tower !!,1
"every time i see the eiffel in my sights as i reach the city , i feel a tingle .",1
during winter there is a mini ice rink on the first floor which adds to experience .,1
it 's big and made of metal and its iconic .,1
"i decided to go to the top floor even with low hanging clouds and could n't see anything , should have just stuck with the 2nd floor option ... whether you decide to go up or view from a distance , the eiffel tower is a must see for all .",1
it really spoilt the experience and leaves you feeling hassled .,1
eiffel tower is a must see when you are in paris .,1
we had a beautiful day to do it .,1
the view from the second level was great .,1
travelers would enjoy the numerous views from the open bus tour .,1
"if the queues are long , take the steps .",1
had to queue for 40 minutes to get my ticket but it was worth it .,1
seen it in in print and on tv but seeing it actually is a different experience .,1
some people gets nervous stepping on it but i thought it was pretty cool .,1
make sure that you book online well in advance as it gets sold out quickly .,1
the ground counter only allows you to buy tickets up to second floor .,1
there 's toilets on second floor but always a long queue .,1
we also happen to catch rhianna running for her limo and the paparazzi following which was entertaining .,1
we booked tickets for 8pm although the queues were short and i imagine for the lift we wouold have waited 20min and no wait to go up the stairs .,1
it 's joyful !,1
plus you can walk around and try the many eats found at the foot of the tower .,1
"it is an outstanding structure , beautiful both day and night .",1
the view from the top is simply breathtaking .,1
then move beneath it for a breathtaking view .,1
long queues and many people detracted from the visit .,1
just great to be there,1
the biggest must-do part about it is booking you ticket online .,1
i did n't have time to go up the tower but the queues were still huge even on a wet day .,1
this was an excellent visit and the tower is magnificent .,1
"but it is crowded , which makes the standing lines long and when up on the tower you had to wait even for the lifts down .",1
the perfect way to end a day in paris at one of the most iconic attractions in the world .,1
this is a croweded and popular venue .,1
it is awesome to be there on top when there is no crowd .,1
that and the constant pitches from street vendors detracts from the experience .,1
"do n't miss to do ice skating on 1st floor , it 's free of charge .",1
this saves you a lot of time waiting in line .,1
up in mont mart there is a church calked sacre coer and also there are a couple of tall building either end of the city with room top bars .,1
we were there from 5 pm to 11 pm but that included riding the 9 pm 1-hr cruise that departed next to the eiffel tower .,1
"i recommend a tour for any visitor , just because you can learn interesting things about the tower , paris and environs .",1
easy to find .,1
lovely spot for couples in the lovely city of paris and in the lovely country of france !,1
we found a cracking little wine shop just round the corner that sold chilled champagne with a cool bag for about 15 euro with plastic glasses .,1
"this is a must ho to place in paris , it is such s magnificent piece of work , going on top of the tower and give you a great view of the city too .",1
i do n't much care about going up in it .,1
would n't have missed it for anything .,1
"crowded on the 2nd floor , and then crowded again at the summit .",1
we were able to go to dinner and come back for our 9:30 pm appointment .,1
we had a picnic in the champs de mars and a go on the carousel ; sublime .,1
the area around it is filled with tons of people trying to scam you and take your money .,1
everyone should visit the eiffel tower at least once in their life .,1
"it 's nice to visit it at different times , during the day versus on a clear night .",1
just breathtaking at night .,1
"despite visiting paris a few times , i had never been to this tower .",1
"reasonably priced , surprisingly so to see the top , the architecture is awe inspiring .",1
"having just arrived at cdg a few hours before , my daughter and i wanted to `` jump into paris with both feet '' , so we found which metro line would get us the closest and headed out .",1
"really overcrowded , needs extra patience but views are amazing , and it 's quite cold and windy when you get to the top .",1
a number of soldiers in groups of five and very well armed patrol constantly move about .,1
"but still , it was a nice visit even from the outside .",1
the structure and construction is an engineering marvel .,1
although a foggy -lrb- or was that smog ? -rrb-,1
"it was sooo long , even in mid november !!",1
"this occurs around the start of the hour for example 20:00 , 21:00 and continues for 5 minutes .",1
my daughter said seeing it was her dream come true .,1
the process of getting onto the lifts was very well organised but i suspect that during the summer months it may take a great deal longer to get to the 3 floors .,1
"you can buy tickets in advance , but make sure that the expected weather will be suitable",1
make sure you look at the tower at night when it twinkles intermittently .,1
would definitely recommend paying the extra couple of euro and going to the top !,1
was great to see it at night and on the hour when a short light show seems to take place on the hour,1
i havent got much time .,1
"this must be one of the most iconic landmarks in the word , and i just love it .",1
very small line to enter and another small line to buy tickets to ride the elevator to the top .,1
"i guess for security reasons , you need to pass through security before walking underneath the tower .",1
it is pretty much required that you visit the eiffel tower when in paris .,1
i would recommend a glass of champers while your walking around looking at the view .,1
it 's not every day that you 're going to see something quite as brilliant as the eiffel tower -lrb- unless of course you live in paris -rrb- .,1
we got to the second platform well worth every penny .,1
"however , everywhere you turn and they were people trying to hustle selling you water , souvenirs , bracelets .",1
do n't fall for any of their stupid tricks and let them rain on your parade .,1
we also went at the top which was good fun too .,1
wear something comfortable as there is long long lines of waiting .,1
"it was very , very crowded and there was no personnel inside to help or organize the huge lines to get in the elevators .",1
security at the entrance was a plus as there is no safe areas in paris anymore .,1
we turned the corner and there was the eiffel tower sparkling in the night .,1
lots of security these days so you have to queue up to get in to the main part which we did not do .,1
"i went there thinking i 'd stay for an hour or so , i ended up staying for 4 or 5 hours , just soaking up the incredible sights .",1
do not waste your time .,1
"you 'll be disappointed , because it 's really a very impressive piece of architecture made of metal .",1
"but you 'll be amazed when you see this tower at night , super romantic and picture perfect !",1
would not have attempted climbing up the stairs .,1
"excellent tour guide , it was fun and informative as she is a parisian , ophelie you are the best .",1
"unfortunately , i 've never had the chance to go to the top .",1
try walking down the stairs .,1
got up to the 2nd floor and up there 's a line to go up to the top floor -lrb- additional ticket purchase required -rrb- but the line was full .,1
"unique , known around the world , beautiful by day or night , a sight to see , a site to see from ... you will want to come back more than once and see it from all angles and from different times of the day .",1
"we got access to the second floor -lrb- admittedly we skipped the queue , but that is what the premium is for -rrb- .",1
only complaint is that they stuffed everyone at the same time so elevator ride was too crowded and uncomfortable .,1
long lines but a must do !,1
the staff were actually somewhat polite and the views were incredible .,1
the first stop on the journey was paris .,1
"i did not climbed the tower , because when you climb the tower you do n't see it , but the surroundings .",1
they got it done but perhaps someone could put in unisex bathrooms ?,1
or night .,1
absolutely floored with out amazing and gorgeous it was .,1
"warning , people come up to you asking you to sign a petition , do n't sign anything they then ask you for a donation , it is a scam .",1
when we went it was significantly cooler and windier at the top .,1
a definite must see when you travel to paris !,1
still worth going !,1
i think the best place is in front of `` palais de chaillot '' and alexander the third bridge .,1
"nightview and dayview , all of them are good .",1
"we had to wait 2 hours in line in may 2015 , in december 2015 , we purchased the lunch deal in advance and were able to be on the first floor within 10 minutes of arrival !",1
it 's a must for any traveler to paris .,1
of course we came to see the famed tour eiffel .,1
the christmas bazaar is right across the street .,1
second visit to paris and the eiffel towel and it does not disappoint .,1
"have always wanted to go up the tower since a kid , and was not disappointed .",1
amazing view but the lift was broken when we arrived to collect our pre booked tickets .,1
we visited in june of 2014 .,1
you see it and your in paris !,1
"yes , right it is !!",1
"up , up and away we went .",1
they also have free ice skating on the first floor .,1
"not everybody takes the trip to the top , though , but it is definitely worth it !",1
good place for pictures of the city and to learn about how the eiffel tower was built .,1
"i mean , when the workers are fed up with the crime at this beloved tourist attraction , you know it has to be serious .",1
"the eiffel tower represents paris and france , liberty , equality , and fraternity it also stands for freedom and never having fear .",1
lined up on for over an hour .,1
there is an air of expectation of what a fabulous view is awaiting up there when you first see it from afar .,1
as good to see under the eiffel tower as it is to look from the distance ... .,1
"i have seen the eiffel tower on many occasions , up close , from afar , day and night .",1
but visiting the surrounding champ de mars and trocadero are also part of the visit .,1
"the iron lady still tops all other parisian sights : she is the icon of the city of light to paraphrase a famous quote : if you are tired of the eiffel tower , you are tired of life !",1
half the touts in paris seem to work here !,1
watch the light show - its not that amazing but the culture of sitting around and drinking and eating is really worth it .,1
"you can go down by elevator however , without a fee .",1
read about it before you visit to make your visit that much more fulfilling .,1
what city immediately pops into your mind ?,1
the best is the lights that make it sparkle at for five minutes every hour at night !,1
we were told we could not go in because there had been a storm that afternoon and something had fallen off the tower .,1
"one of the things i like about paris is that wherever i was in the city i would try to find the eiffel tower and when i could see it , i knew i was in paris .",1
yes the iron lady is beautiful and considered a much see .,1
they are well worth it if you are on a schedule .,1
the walk up is only some 10-15 minutes - not for an olympian but for a family with two kids under ten .,1
tempted to just look at it from afar ?,1
"finally , when you are in the eiffel tower neighborhood , walk to the pont de bir-hakeim bridge , that was shown in the movie inception .",1
the cue to got all the way to the top is long but worth it .,1
"particularly amusing was the fact that after the public outcry of the tower being erected , officials claimed it was a `` temporary '' exhibit ... classic !!",1
"if you are able to climb 669 stairs , then avoid the line ups to the lifts .",1
spotted many pickpockets .,1
a night cruise with a view to the tower is exceptional,1
"symbol of the french capital , the tower is made of forged steel , inaugurated on march 31 , 1889 , the eiffel tower was built to honor the centenary of the french revolution .",1
beautiful - breath taking !,1
"you can jog around the area too , which is motivating to have the eiffel right in front of you .",1
you do n't think paris without thinking the eiffel tower .,1
the views are stunning & worth the wait .,1
there 's a great view of paris on the upper level of the tower .,1
each passing hour provide new look and different charm to this iconic structure .,1
2nd climb is a bit scary and stiff but once you at the top its lovely .,1
views are just unbeatable .,1
"it 's around 700 steps in total , so wear your trainers and take some water , but totally worth it on a clear day .",1
but having said that the views are incredible .,1
it 's a must see at night .,1
"once you are up to the first plateau , you can buy tickets to take you all the way to the top .",1
"given number of reviews , there is n't much new to say about the tower itself .",1
we met about 6 in the evening for the tour .,1
"being afraid of heights , i decided to only go to second level and to my surprise , the second level was higher than i expected !!",1
book your skip the line tickets first .,1
we had a tour to the eiffel tower while we were in paris .,1
the places around also complement and gives you better view from every angle .,1
"then , even though we had a voucher to go to the mid level restaurant , we had to exchange our voucher for tickets .",1
the wait for the lift for the third floor was bigger and it took us around 45 - 60 min to reach the top .,1
glad we walked otherwise it would have been a short trip but walking meant you saw all the nuts and bolts on the way up .,1
went up at around 8 p.m and got an amazing view of both day and night .,1
also this time we signed up with an express package -lrb- viator -rrb- and had a personal guide -lrb- leah i think -rrb- .,1
i really enjoyed,1
its a long way up !,1
"amazing views , great security and one ticked off the bucket list !",1
it is both a magnificent piece of engineering and a larger-than-life work of art .,1
we nearly did n't go as the eiffel tower website said that the tours up the tower were fully booked up .,1
i have been here several times .,1
so come in the `` off '' season .,1
after walking around paris the whole day .,1
there is a two stop security system in place at the eiffel tower ; one baggage scan on the outer perimeter fence and one after ticket purchase .,1
a little bit of a tourist trap as you get attacked with gypsies and people trying to sell you things .,1
"another tip : simply go to the top , do n't waste time on the first level !!",1
what is so great about it ?,1
once done with lunch we took the stairs to the second level for even better views .,1
i like to get there from the museum of humanity .,1
"one of the most memorable things in paris , so definitely worth spending the money to go .",1
the eiffel tower offers beautiful views to the whole of paris .,1
"you walk up to the first level , and then get the lift to the very top .",1
it 's simply breath taking .,1
the lights come on at dusk and every hour the twinkling light show begins .,1
only given it a 3 as it 's not very wheel chair friendly you ca n't go right to the top if your in a chair apart from that it 's good got a few shops and cafes on second floor stunning views if not cloudy and a glass floor panel on floor one expect delays on lifts though,1
of course !,1
"fortunately we visited in october , and early in the day and so avoided the hundreds of tourist but those that were there were an absolute pain with their selfie sticks being waved about in everyone 's face .",1
i was going to book a tour but very glad we didnt as felt that what we did we really enjoyed .,1
i enjoyed my stay in paris because of great famous places such as eiffel tower and louvre museum .,1
my wife has always dreamed of seeing the eiffel tower and we went on our honeymoon .,1
"i 'm a history buff , she 's an incurable romantic , so the eiffel tower was great for both of us .",1
everyone going to paris must visit this,1
i suggest getting their early to beat the crowds .,1
unfortunately even in september the lift queues were long .,1
"just be aware , and keep your items in front of you .",1
no email was sent so we emailed viator for assistance - the website says they offer assistance 24/7 .,1
"nevertheless , it was a very long wait to get the second elevator to the top ; once there it was very crowded .",1
the eiffel tower is synonymous with paris making it a must see when you visit .,1
our family attended this world famous monument and loved it .,1
where are the rude french people you hear about ?,1
"also , the top of the eiffel tower has a little champagne bar , but what you have to remember is that this bar does not open until 12 pm so you will have to wait until that time , at least , to get some champagne while enjoying the extraordinary view of paris .",1
we climbed the stairs to the first level .,1
it 's a spectacle sure .,1
"even though it needs no introduction , as you approach it it is completely mesmorizing !",1
well of course this is a must see thing if you are first time at paris .,1
had climbed it years ago so didnt this time we visited but actually we were surprised at how cheap it would have been to go up one stage .,1
"we chose to sit on the champ de mars and watch the lights come on , and whilst it got a bit repetitive saying no to the traders it was a lovely way to spend a warm evening -lrb- and it was free ! -rrb-",1
"so i decide to go back down , but the line up is just as long as the one going up .",1
go paris city vision located nearby the joan of arc statue and you wo n't miss anything when it comes to getting all the eiffel tower has to offer .,1
the view was spectacular and you could spend an hour easily on the top floor and second floor .,1
make sure you spend enough time there .,1
they cram quite a few people in the lifts and on the platforms and getting nice photos can be difficult .,1
if you wait until quite late the eiffel tower flickers and is such a thrill .,1
you will receive your ticket by email just print it or show it on your phone .,1
we also walked down from the 2nd level via the stairs which is worth it too !!,1
"this was my second visit to the eiffel tower , first in 1994 with contiki tour and recently with my husband and 14 year old daughter .",1
will definitely recommend to anyone to go to the top floor .,1
i love paris and this is my second time visiting the eiffel tower in less than a year .,1
everyone told me to book tickets in advance to go to the top .,1
this included a boat trip on the seine as well as cycling to the eiffel tower .,1
"as someone who loves architecture and history , i love it every time i go up the tower .",1
my hubby and teenage son did the behind the scenes eiffel tower tower .,1
it still amazes me .,1
i only wish we could have stayed another day so we could get our pictures at night .,1
i can not comment on the value to go to the top .,1
"all that being said , the area around the tower is crazytown .",1
definitely good value as we were there for around 2/3 hours .,1
i 'm not sure this monument needs a review as it 's so iconic .,1
when we went there they made us wait in the line for hours due to security reasons .,1
"the view is amazing , and the food and service were very good .",1
it 's great to go up to this iconic landmark !,1
thankfully we had skip the line passes as the queues looked ridiculous and actually getting up the tower is a nice escape from the scams below .,1
but the police moved in and moved people on .,1
you 'll see incredible views from the top but be aware of pickpocketing - it 's the worst in this area .,1
what happens at the second queue at the second floor ?,1
great day out but 100 % book before you go !!!,1
it 's a beautiful setting and they make it secure enough for anyone who is afraid of heights .,1
in total we probably spend about an hour wandering around the two levels taking in the sights .,1
one of the main reasons for coming to visit paris was to come and see the eiffel tower .,1
"you 'll be bombarded by people trying to sell you wine , drinks , selfie sticks , etc. .",1
head back down before the turn of the hour to watch it light up and sparkle !,1
a reservation absolutely helps !,1
but having seen it happen here i thought i 'd mention it .,1
"i am not sure if i will have the same reaction if i first saw it during the day , so my suggestion is that take a night seine cruise and enjoy the hide-n-seek game the tower plays with you as the boat goes along the river ... finally showing its whole self at the end of the cruise .",1
inspires romance !,1
the best experience is to sit in the nearby gardens and have a glass of wine and enjoying the romantic setup,1
"if you miss this during your paris visit , then you made a mistake .",1
maybe this is a lesson to people who live in paris and snub others .,1
we were here mid morning .,1
"book tickets in advance though , ques are crazy .",1
"obviously , this is a must .",1
"went to the top of the tower , great views of paris .",1
loved it !!!,1
fantastic views from top and of the top .,1
you will never get tired of looking at this magnificent structure .,1
book your tickets online and save time on queuing up .,1
i was with a tour group and we skipped the enormous lines and still felt a bit underwhelmed by the experience .,1
try to simply ignore them and act like you do n't speak english .,1
"seat nearby , eat-drink something and look on it ... its just relaxing and amazing !!!!",1
great views of the city and lived up to our expectations .,1
"better still , try dinner at the jules verne restaurant on the lower level .",1
beautiful no matter where you stand .,1
"what an amazing structure this tower is.the views from the platforms is fantastic , just standing and admiring you realise just how enormous it really is .",1
also provides a wonderful panoramic view of paris from the top .,1
we arrived around 9.30 am and the lines moved quite fast .,1
as someone who is afraid of heights i took a few pics and went back down to the second floor .,1
we were here on honeymoon more years ago than either of us care to dwell on but we still find it romantic to sit in a café right at the base of such a fantastic icon so we hope you will experience the magic of the eiffel tower .,1
"the reality is that waiting in-line , right underneath the eiffel tower , with the diversity of the world passing right by you , is part of the experience !",1
nothing can describe the feeling you get when you first see the eiffel tower in the horizon .,1
unavoidable .,1
chose a viator `` all of paris in a day '' tour which included lunch at the eiffel tower .,1
we walked to the second story and took the elevator to the top .,1
"when you have time , do take the elevator to overlook whole paris city",1
"people keep saying it 's overrated , but during my 10 days in paris i never got sick of the amazing view of this tower .",1
"we all enjoyed it and felt that it was an excellent learning experience for our children , and it was .",1
the only negative had to be the waves of people selling their wines and roses haha !,1
"we were able to go see the strobe lights at every hour beginning at 8 p.m. , definitely a must , just to experience the eiffel tower in lights .",1
"no matter how hard one tries to not look or act like a tourist , there comes a time when .",1
need to check prior to your visit as the light show times may vary .,1
i purchased a ticket to go to the top of the tower but the queue was very large for that and i did n't have time to wait .,1
amazing engineering and architecture .,1
tip use the stairs as the que for the lift could take you an hour or two and stairs will be clear .,1
visited paris a number of times .,1
here 's my tips .,1
it looks beautiful lit up at night,1
"whoever goes to paris , they have to get on eiffel tower for sure .",1
getting through the lines is impossible or at lest will take up a large chunk of your day .,1
"if you are planning your trip to france , then its a must visit site .",1
we went to the 2nd floor and also to the very top .,1
the queues are enormous !!,1
we also ventured back at night to see it lit up and that was pretty great as well .,1
then walk to the subway and the turn around a take a picture at night awesome wooh !,1
"for the energetic , you can climb to the top or at least part of the way up .",1
both meals were exceptional !!!,1
"the queues were very long , standing in the hot sun to buy a ticket .",1
"was there mid december for 9 days and it was closed throughout due to : rats infestation , strikes etc. .",1
i visited tower on foot - gret option !,1
after going through 2 security check points we were on our way up the elevator .,1
"was great value for money , the views were spectacular & the staff could n't do enough to help .",1
this was mid february so i would imagine ticket queues in summer would be crazy long .,1
the only thing obviously that can be a little obnoxious -lrb- if you let it -rrb- is the constant attempts to scam and the begging .,1
we did tour the tower and had dinner there .,1
"even thought he top deck was closed when i visited , the view and experience was still well worth it .",1
... it is just like a dream come true . . . each time shows you a different view of the city of paris it is just magnifique,1
i was wrong and so my sister missed out on a cool mug .,1
was a fabulous experience to be at top of eiffel tower drinking champagne .,1
and then you are saying `` yes it looks beautiful right now . '',1
the earliest tickets are mid december .,1
visited twice in one year .,1
an easy process according to my husband who got them .,1
absolutely breathtaking up close and the views are amazing !,1
"yeah why not , is it the best place to visit ?",1
after doing so ... i 'd say do n't bother going to the top if it 's cold .,1
the tower itself will always be a stunning french icon and nothing can take this away .,1
"wow , what a view and amazing structure .",1
sooo worth it though .,1
so my first tip is to purchase your ticket online from the official eiffel website .,1
awesome !!,1
the tickets open up 90 days out from the date you want .,1
it was an amazing view at the top and it was a bright day so could see all around .,1
"once on the first level the view was wonderful , amenities clean , kiosk and gift shop available , no crowds .",1
"we went at 930am , had no wait on a wednesday and went right to the top .",1
"once you get up there , the crowd seemed to thin and definitely found plenty of opportunity for good photos .",1
you need to be some how far enough to include all the tower in your photo,1
"if you 're in paris , i think we all know that the eiffel tower is a must !",1
we went to the eiffel tower early on a sunday morning with a reserved ticket for a specific time for the elevator to the top booked in advance .,1
can see the entire city of paris from every direction .,1
what a day to remember .,1
the views were fabulous to see the city below .,1
i was amazed !!!!!,1
its actually huge .,1
from the second level you have no option but to catch a lift to the third level and tickets can be purchased for this up the tower .,1
"evans and evans makes it appear that you will go in , but only takes you close to it .",1
we went on a thursday morning and there were initially no queues .,1
it 's ticked off my list of things to do .,1
definitely go up the top if you can .,1
"a challenge for her , walking all the way up , but we would do it again .",1
but getting on top of level 3 was a breeze even though the entrance gates were bit crowded .,1
must do in paris .,1
we did the tour with a guide .,1
i have been to paris twice and have felt the urge to go to this attraction twice and do not regret it !!,1
about 9 p.m. we had finished dinner after our long flight to paris .,1
go right to the top level if you paid for the very top .,1
a must see if you are going to paris .,1
i visited the eiffel tower a few days ago.the views from both the second and top floors are breathtaking -lrb- we did n't bother with the first floor -rrb- .,1
we arrived slightly ahead of our booked time so decided to have a walk around the outside first and take some pictures .,1
what 's not to love a lovely trip .,1
"and finally a queue for the lift , with the final security check .",1
"eiffel tower is as fantastic as you might imagine - we were delighted with the views , were lucky with weather and saw all the main features of paris especially good from the second level .",1
"by the time we left -lrb- about 10am -rrb- the queues were spiralling around the whole square , practically filling it , people were having to be sprayed with water in the heat and they were limiting the numbers allowed in according to how many had left .",1
"i was , at this point , lying on the ground , several yards away .",1
they went to the second floor of the tower and learnt about the history and inner workings of the iron lady !,1
"i would also recommend to go around this time , since we were able to see the sunset from the top .",1
i ca n't get enough of it every time a go to paris .,1
we be done this twice now and it really is a cool memory of paris .,1
we visited the weekend of the world cup .,1
it was closed due to a strike !,1
take the time to go to the summit .,1
go at twilight to see the lights of paris come to life .,1
"we were in paris after fifteen long years , this time with our children and the one thing that still looks as majestic as ever is the eiffel tower .",1
it 's nothing special so if your not keen on heights or exercise ... .,1
this should be on the top of list '' to must see before die '' : -rrb-,1
"although , it is not the tallest in the word .",1
marvelous place to be .,1
"for this reason , i think it 's worth visiting after you 've spent a few days in paris so you can appreciate the landmarks and the various districts of the city .",1
ca n't imagine anyone going to paris and missing this .,1
"we visited the tower as part of an evening tour and got to eat in the first floor restaurant , a great experience .",1
the glass elevator was a good experience if only slightly vertiginous .,1
so massive !,1
always crowded .,1
we did to the second floor because it was windy and we were with our 18 month baby .,1
we are coming back again !,1
perfect .,1
one of our favorite viewing locations is in the jardins du trochadero across the seine .,1
we were lucky as we had not to wait to go up to the tower .,1
we spoke to someone who was working in the tower and they acted as if they were n't sure of the procedure .,1
great view a must do of course ... .,1
a landmark that should be visited .,1
"there were 2 queues when we arrived , one long queue for the lift and one short queue to walk to the 2nd floor .",1
definitely worthwhile !,1
i can imagine that it gets extremely busy in summer months so allow plenty of time for queues .,1
go when the weather is good so you can walk to the top and have good views of the city .,1
and you could try the stairs if you feel fit enough !,1
"best way to see how beautiful paris is , laid out before you in all her glory .",1
a great time !,1
and walk away do n't bother and due to safety issues try to not bring bags .,1
"going here , we took the trocadero exit .",1
"after taking photos and delighting in the atmosphere , on a whim , we decided to go up !",1
"you can find some nice gift shops , bakeries and a restaurant in the second floor .",1
plan and book your tickets well in advance if you want to climb up the tower .,1
i went in at around 10 pm on sunday .,1
"from you , you will get a nice full body and full tower shot .",1
i 'll try again on my next trip .,1
the stair ascent between the 1st and 2nd level felt scarier to me ... it seemed to be extra steep and all you can see is beams and high places .,1
we love this place .,1
i booked a tour through viator .,1
"i finally got up to the second level , and the view of paris was breathtaking .",1
it 's also nice walking around during the day and take some picture from the surrounding .,1
it is more expensive that way but you go ahead of what must have been a 3 hour line .,1
"dress appropriately , as it can be quite cool at the top .",1
how could you miss out on the tower ?,1
"when i was there , there was a terror threat and the attraction was closed .",1
"our concierge told us to go around dinner time to minimize line ups , we did and it worked .",1
in the evening be sure to be there on the hour when thousands of strobe lights installed for the millennium twinkle like stars .,1
"easy , convenient , cheap , no lines , totally worth it .",1
see at night from pont alexander - worth it !!,1
taking the stairs over elevator was a good choice to get close to eiffel .,1
a little disconcerting but we all got used to it .,1
:--rrb- you could walk up too .,1
long wait during weekend .,1
did n't wait long to go up and did n't cost a lot .,1
"i did not go up it , i had done that many years ago .",1
we first went in the morning but left as the queues were so long retuned in late afternoon and was much better .,1
the views are worth the wait !,1
take the elevator to the top !,1
"there are a number of interesting exhibits , restaurants , shops , etc , which all make the experience quite surreal .",1
although it is a lot of steps up to the first level you can take your time as the stairs are wide enough for people to pass each other .,1
the view is breathtaking and a must do if you 're only in paris for a few days .,1
"the moment the eiffel tower came to my view , my heart almost skipped a beat .",1
i would also suggest going at night to see the tower lit up and sparkling .,1
booking in advance with paris city vision -lrb- pcv -rrb- saved us at least couple of hour as the tickets were provided once we arrived at the tower .,1
there are sandwiches and other lunch sort of food and libations on that first level .,1
when you approach eiffel and if day turn to night you start to see lights on it .,1
we paid for a tour guide and this was helpful in gaining timely admission and learning facts about the tower and about the landmarks we saw in all directions .,1
this was third visit to the eiffel tower and still i could get enough of it .,1
this landmark makes you smile as its visible all thru paris central .,1
little did we know that we would then have to wait in a line for 1 hour to get to the summit .,1
it was very windy so did n't stay up there very long .,1
the views were amazing as expected .,1
the experience would have been more pleasant as we waited for our reservations for lunch if the street vendors were n't there harassing us .,1
this allows you to enter a separate entrance during a certain time slot -lrb- for which you bought the ticket -rrb- .,1
"we recently visited the eiffel tower on our trip to paris , of course , it 's a must !",1
the views are stunning and you ca n't help marveling at the engineering skill it took to build it .,1
long queues for tickets so book online or book tickets via a tour operator to fast-track .,1
for sure it 's super touristy .,1
"decided to climb the stairs as far as we could , which was the 2nd floor , it was great , better views than in the lift .",1
walk up to second level as much better experience .,1
unfortunately we coul not see the top of the tower too well because it was foggy but we still enjoyed it .,1
we went up to the tower by stairs - much shorter queue -lrb- waiting time -rrb- and cheaper -lrb- eur7 for adult -rrb- .,1
"a brilliant attraction , a must do visit in paris !",1
going later on has its benifits .,1
i have no words for how truly amazing the beauty is .,1
this is of course a must visit for any first time tourist in paris queues are long but that ca n't be helped and it is worth it .,1
"take the steps to the top , just make sure it 's not after leg day !",1
"one of my favorite things in paris , especially at night since they started the sparkly lights .",1
"loved this iconic place , go to the top for the most amazing views of paris !",1
i found it cooler to view it from the top of notre dame with a view of the city surrounding it .,1
"once at the top we took in the views , but it was freezing .",1
iconic landmark and must see in paris .,1
paris is to be enjoyed and not a place to wait in line .,1
"at the top of the two floors of stairs you can climb , you are left with the satisfaction of having made it up 704 steps and the spectacular view ahead of you .",1
staff are very friendly and helpful and it is simple to navigate around the tower and signage is excellent .,1
travel ight as you must go through security .,1
"i feel confident to say that paris truly justifies its nickname , `` city of love '' .",1
views of surrounding areas were spectacular .,1
simply how do you not make this a part of the visit ?,1
make sure you go at night and by day !,1
"however , there is no visitor-friendly display about the paris skyline , so you ca n't actually figure out what 's in the view u less you are already familiar with paris attractions .",1
sparkles every hour on the hour for those who do n't know .,1
i think the best pictures are from the embankment metro .,1
at night it was nicely lit up .,1
this time is smoother and quickly with advanced booking on the internet .,1
"many years ago we visited paris and did n't go up the eiffel tower so this time we made sure we did , and we were not disappointed .",1
it actually humbled me with its colossal size !,1
"many people - arrive in good time , so you have time to find the right entrance .",1
our guide pointed out sights which could be seen from each side of the tower .,1
it is also not on the paris pass .,1
the shops are expensive but cute !,1
you ca n't go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower !,1
this by far the most spectacular sight in paris at night !,1
hope this is temporary .,1
walk the steps its a long way up but its worth it to see paris,1
what an experience .,1
it will take time to get through security which does not seem to be too strict .,1
"built to be temporary for the 1889 expo celebrating the french revolution , it became quickly the symbol of the city itself .",1
on top of the world in the most beautiful city in the world !!,1
"it was a dream to visit eiffel tour , but when you up there you have an indescribable feelings the view is more than fantastic during daytime and in the night you will have a lovely view of the city of light",1
"security gates were put up around the site for the first time we 've seen , but it was quick and painless .",1
going up to 2nd floor and to the top was not included but up to you if you wanted to go at your own expense .,1
we went at a great time it was n't too crowded and it was a beautiful day .,1
we were treated as 5 star patrons by staff and thoroughly recommend the experience .,1
walk around at night .,1
lighting it for euro2016 was just a mesmerizing site to look for every night during the games,1
this was our first thing to do in paris and we completely loved it !,1
i can heartily recommend get your guide priority tickets to the eiffel tower .,1
very impressive and great views of the city .,1
"great value to top at 17 euros pet adult and 8 per child , amazing 2 hours up there , not hurried at all , it went for basking blue sky to lamp lit city , boats going up seine all illuminated ... just wonderful , an experience we will never forget .",1
"the first level turned out to be the less crowded and most interesting , had glass floor , game book for kids which was fun for all and lots of history was learned .",1
it was the highlight of our visit .,1
"yes it is a crowded and the vendors are a bit annoying , but this is something we always wanted to see and it certainly met our expectations .",1
i would not recommend the climb for people who are out of shape .,1
although i 've been many times before took my family and it was beyond expectation .,1
we only went to the 2nd floor as we visited in peak summer and it was very crowded .,1
beautiful weather meant beautiful views .,1
"we made a bee line for the tower when we arrived in paris as we never got to see it on our previous visit , and we were n't disappointed .",1
we ate at le jules verne and loved it !,1
i even spent new year under the tower several years ago .,1
booking online in advance will help you skip the lines .,1
no visit to the city of paris would be complete without a trip up the eiffel tower .,1
walking to the top is only for younger folks .,1
"we went to paris this month for the first time with our two children , 11 and 13 .",1
"supposedly , that gets you up to the second level without the lines .",1
the day we did our tour there were people packed in light and even the photos from inside the tower were very restricted with the amount of people around .,1
when i was up to the second floor i noticed the view of paris ... .,1
i took the elevator up but the stairs down as much as i could .,1
always feels like a third world city .,1
the eiffel tower is the heart of paris .,1
roman was our guide and told us a lot about various buildings and structures once we got to the top and had a beautiful panoramic view of the city .,1
"not take your breath away experience like at the grand canyon , but it 's beautiful nonetheless , if near dusk .",1
first of all it is super crowded .,1
it was a rainy -lrb- on again/off again day -rrb- day in paris .,1
save this for after the louvre at the end of your day .,1
the only downfall is all the street vendors in your face .,1
fantastic trip to the tower .,1
no trip to paris is complete without going to this iconic landmark .,1
- i felt scared the first time i was all the way up to the top !,1
you ca n't imagine how big it is until you actually see it in person .,1
but even if you do n't feel like going up is so great to walk around and explore all the possible angles around the tower !,1
first you wait to get a ticket and then to get to second level and then from second to top .,1
absolutely wonderful trip .,1
this is by far the biggest must do whilst in paris !,1
an engineering marvel in its time .,1
amazing view and great history behind !,1
there was a considerable wait for the elevators .,1
in the second floor you have ice skating for free and it nice to finish with that,1
"after the sad terrorist attack to paris , security was enhanced in all public attractions in paris .",1
one can climb upto the second floor .,1
i ca n't wait to go again .,1
i would recommend going up to the top whether you elect to walk up or take the elevator .,1
been here a few times and it always takes my breath away .,1
"well worth the wait if you have to , the view on a clear day is amazing !",1
"we went up the lifts to both levels and found it to be a lovely view , but possibly not worth it , considering how busy it was and constantly being on the look out for pick pockets .",1
we have been to paris several times and have never been able to stomach the long lines to ride the elevator up .,1
you just do n't realise how long it 's gon na take to get up and down once you 've passed the ticket queue .,1
worth a visit for sure,1
you can get tickets to the third level once you are on the second floor .,1
ca n't wait to go again : - -rrb-,1
"i had pre booked the ticket for eiffel tower tour through viator as the normal queue will be very long.so , we got to skip the line and reach top of the eiffel tower.the view is iconic and worth the money.a must visit if you are going to paris.i would suggest both evening and morning visit.we had gone in evening as well .",1
"one of them is only for stairs -lrb- a good workout , 720 steps to the second floor if i remember correctly -rrb- , one for groups , one for elevators , one for fast forwarsd etc. .",1
"by the time the tower opened at 9am , the line had snaked all the way back .",1
tall and amazing human creation of human being .,1
staff at the ticket booth / entrance very ...,1
of course its fame goes back 100 years but is well deserved .,1
my mum and i decided to climb the tower rather than wait in the line .,1
"c'mon , paris , take some lessons from disney world or most attractions in any city and give us tourists a more tolerable experience with some simple line organization .",1
most romantic sight ever !,1
the only reason why it 's 4 stars instead of is the unbearable crowd around the tower and the monstrous waiting line to get in .,1
we drove by the eiffel tower during the day and it was much too crowded .,1
it 's surreal .,1
excellent icon of france !,1
the night tour is just amazing .,1
it 's a beautiful park where the eiffel tower is located perfect for a picnic wether it 's during the day or late in the evening !,1
"after getting down from passy station , as i was walking towards trocadero , my heart was pacing as if i was going to meet my love .",1
the queues are horrendous and if it 's in hot sunshine there is no shade .,1
the eiffel tower is a must in your visit !,1
"it was a great tour , but very windy .",1
the eiffel tower towers over all the rest of the landmarks in paris and overall is the iconic structure most people want and should see while in paris .,1
it is a must go place in paris .,1
i am reduced to tears the first time i visit the tower on each visit to paris .,1
"i really recommend doing that , was much easier then expected .",1
pretty the area up !,1
and you ca n't buy tickets unless you have your entire party .,1
awesome pictures .,1
we thoroughly enjoyed the underground tour of the inner working of the tower .,1
"it 's impressive when you 're standing at it 's base , and when it 's being lit at night .",1
i was very impressed with how well she spoke each language .,1
well it is now .,1
"the sun was going down as we got more pictures , did more gazing , when : the lights came on !",1
but i strongly recommend purchasing tickets in advance .,1
"thankfully we did have a reservation , meaning we did n't have to queue up for a second time once inside the security ring and i would recommend going online and pre booking to everyone .",1
the amazing view of the entire city from the top is unmatched and should not be missed .,1
views from the top are also good .,1
those who went to the summit said it was well worth it .,1
the climb was not hard as i 've expected .,1
a must do if you visit paris !!,1
"being an american , who lives in the uk , and visiting france for the first time -lrb- we were there for disney -rrb- , it was a brilliant day out .",1
you can not go to paris and not visit here .,1
such a lovely place to visit - we managed to get to the top as the sun was setting which was a bonus and this was not planned .,1
and a steampunk monument .,1
i was not a big fan of the eiffel tower .,1
"when i was at the top of the eiffel tower , i could n't see anything .",1
best time of day to see it is late afternoon and then hang around until early evening when they turn the lights on it .,1
the restaurant above the eiffel tower is simply amazing !,1
advise buying a pass in advance,1
"we did n't bother to pre book , but the queues kept moving on a holiday morning and we took the option to take the elevator right to the top of the tower .",1
you can buy a glass of champagne right there if you are celebrating something .,1
always worth a visit .,1
we opted for the latter .,1
use bus no 42 from arc du ttromphe,1
not to sure about kids because we do n't have any .,1
"yes , it 's beautiful at night .",1
it was awesome .,1
went with a guide .,1
when i went to customer service they assured me that after i emailed i would get my money back since it was a common mistake and re-bought tickets for that day so long as i emailed right away .,1
i obviously understand the necessity .,1
i can see it would be pretty at night but you could see it from a boat tour on the seine and have a better time .,1
my favorite way to do it is to take the metro to the trocadero station which stops on a hill above the eiffel tower .,1
"if there is a monument , you have to visit before you die ... it is this one !",1
"stay and see at night when it lights up , it is gorgeous and romantic .",1
all in all it was a great excursion .,1
our friends had dinner there one night and i wish we had made reservations also since they were there for the spectacular light show .,1
"i went last night , after returning from nice to celebrate with the parisiens , their independence day .",1
its amazing to see the gigantic steel structure .,1
"it was much easier to get a monday night , saturday night was sold out .",1
we had lunch here too !,1
i found the area around the tower crowded and dirty -lrb- lots of broken glass and people selling beer in buckets ; euro 2016 fever -rrb- .,1
our guide from sri lanka was friendly and had a lot of information about the tower and surrounding area .,1
no doubt its the most visited paid monument in the world !!,1
we had dinner at 58 eiffel tower and loved it !,1
i was able to eat on the first floor and the food was wonderful .,1
make reservations a few months before your trip .,1
you can do champagne at the very top - although that does n't start until noon .,1
they will get you in far easier !,1
the weather was pouring rain but we had skip the lines tour spots through viatour .,1
we traveled up the to second platform armed with a selfie stick !,1
there is always a very long queue in front of the eiffel tower .,1
beautiful at both day and night .,1
be the queue is very long .,1
i 've always dreamed of going to paris ... and on my first anniversary my dream came true !,1
this strengthy tower is tough though it takes thousands of visitors on it whole year round for years together .,1
the eiffel tower is magical .,1
well worth the views and minimal lines .,1
you can walk the steps to the first and second floors .,1
loved seeing eiffe tower in the dark when it lights up .,1
im pretty sure we paid more for the lift tickets to the second floor then we would have for waiting in line but saved alot of time by not waiting in line in the rain .,1
the night view is definitely prettier but catch both views .,1
"we had to physically push them away to get rid of them , they were quite aggressive .",1
definitely a must see in paris .,1
the expensive collection of artwork will appeal to almost anyone .,1
"as i walked towards it , i felt a since of wonder and awe .",1
nothing special .,1
"no matter how many pictures , movies , t.v. shows or postcards you 've seen of this iconic landmark , nothing beats seeing it in person !",1
i always wanted to see the iconic tower and yes `` dream come true '' .,1
"i just reserved a tickets on line but i had all kind of questions to ask them , let me say this , amazing teams you have , not only answer my question right away their teams also gave me an suggestion and made it so smooth !",1
slightly annoying all the sellers around hassling you to buy their tacky rubbish !,1
avoided the crowds .,1
you really get a sense of how much work went into this structure !!,1
breathtaking view of the city from the top .,1
it is hard to believe 1 -rrb- that this was such a controversial structure when it was built in the 19th century and 2 -rrb- they actually planned to dismantle it .,1
lines were long so we chose to walk up the south tower .,1
"if you really can , its advisable to book your tickets in advance .",1
"there is so much history in paris and fantastic museums , do n't waste too much time on the tower .",1
"we took private transportation to get here , hotel pick up and lunch on the first floor .",1
after visiting i realised why is it one of the 7 wonders .,1
"the luncheon menu is more reasonable in price than the dinner menu , of course .",1
wonderful view from the top at sunset .,1
i love this place .,1
great views but did n't bother with the gift shops .,1
we went here last week and arrived in the morning around 9:20 am and the lines were long .,1
"however , on a normal day , it is impossible to actually go up -lrb- unless you 're in for 2-3h or queueing or a hyper-expensive online jump-the-queue ticket -rrb- .",1
one option i would like to mention is going to the top .,1
the view from top is really good .,1
"sure it not cheap , but would you expect anything else ??",1
climbed to the top at night but could not get a reservation for the restaurant even 2 months ahead .,1
an incredible view .,1
bags are checked before you enter .,1
the most romantic site in paris made even more so by the lights at night .,1
seeing the hourly light show when it gets dark is a lovely way to end the visit .,1
suggest to buy tickets from eiffel tower website months before your visit .,1
make sure to visit the tower at night to see it light up and flashing .,1
the lines to get to the elevators are also very long and time consuming .,1
"at night go to the trocodero and watch it light up and sparkle on the hour , magical .",1
yes there are long ques and yes it 's crowded at the top -lrb- careful with pick pockets -rrb- .,1
it is better to be under it and view it from a cafe with a glass of wine .,1
we went at 5:30 pm and a lift took us to 2nd floor .,1
we got there mid morning on a perfectly sunny day .,1
"our guide told us that we could take the stairs down -lrb- as there is a massive wait to get back down as well -rrb- , but we could only go as far as the first floor -lrb- not ground -rrb- ... so we had to wait for the elevator anyway .",1
"the view is amazing , is better to go by the stairs , so you can do some sport as well .",1
its an impressive structure .,1
scam .,1
a must ... why are you in paris and not going to the tower ?,1
visited the tower in june 2016 during euro cup .,1
there 's a tour eiffel official visitor guide app -lrb- english -rrb- that i enjoyed listening to .,1
it 's usually not a terrible wait but i prefer the view and paris in general during the spring and fall where you have the glorious view of nature 's own color palette .,1
be prepared to have ` your guard on ' pretty much the entire time when visiting the close proximity of the tower during daytime hours .,1
"the best time to visit is night , and we did it .",1
you can book online to go to the second level and then if the top is open on the day you can purchase tickets once you are up there .,1
it even had a temporary ice rink during our visit .,1
also i had been to notre dame the day before and the view from the tower is beautiful .,1
"otherwise , enjoy the view at night from trocadero .",1
good to also see a high level of security all around .,1
"who needs to review it , right ?",1
lovely photos to be taken .,1
it was surreal the moment i got near the tower !,1
the tower just draws you to it .,1
the eiffel tower is just as beautiful in person as you would see in the photos !,1
"some relaxing nearby with their hands filled with food , books .",1
one should visit it in the night too when the lights are twinkling .,1
amazing from a far not so good up close .,1
"no waiting in the long lines , or for the elevator .",1
"the views are amazing , food is a little limited and expensive but no different to any other tourist attraction .",1
"for anyone visiting paris , going to the top of the eiffel tower is a must .",1
a visit to this iconic building is an absolute must .,1
you can see it from many points in the city as well .,1
"we do n't like heights , but we love standing under the tower and looking up .",1
"you can see the whole paris city , try to visit it by night !",1
i think it is much better to find a comfortable spot on the lawn and look up at the tower than it is to queue for hours and look out from the tower .,1
got my tickets online but was not necessary .,1
it simply exceeds expectations !!,1
unfortunately the wait is long and crowded for the elevator despite being in a tour with restaurant reservations on the first level .,1
the eiffel tower is always amazing to see .,1
there are a lot of hawkers in this area .,1
we booked out tickets one month before and got the last time slot of the day so we had to go to the top in the night .,1
just perfect !,1
it was worth the expense and time !,1
but amazing views .,1
so many places you can take fantastic photos with the eiffel tower in .,1
if you ca n't book tickets in advance then i recommend going early .,1
if you get the chance to get to paris and to the eiffel tower make sure you have a little extra time to really take it all in .,1
the must see in paris for all .,1
i would never feel the need to go back but i 'm glad i 've seen it once up close .,1
"but with the tricolor and other special lighting during the euro football in june this year , somehow it seemed to take on a more magical feeling .",1
"if you plan to to take a view from top then please ensure that you buy your tickets online , or else have patience to stand in line for 4 hours .",1
even just going to the 2nd level is really quite high .,1
the views were incredible .,1
and also visit 1st floor to walk on the glass foor .,1
we were a bit surprised at all of the broken beer bottle pieces everywhere & the armed military presence everywhere but glad they were there for everyone 's protection .,1
"if you have a chance to go to the top at night , do it.we went straight to the top and spent ages up there , the strobe lights are amazing and the paris city lights breathtaking .",1
"the view , the engineering , and the fact that you are at an icon of history make it worth while .",1
we took our 2 boys and it was closed .,1
"my experience of this was amazing , as soon as we stepped into paris we were really exited we headed straight for the eiffel tower .",1
"on to more fun topics , the classical concert before the fireworks was magnificent !!!",1
the journey to the summit via the second level was awesome .,1
what was built for radio transmissions has now become one of the most beautiful attractions in the world and it totally deserves it .,1
walked straight on at9pm .,1
"it gets dark really late in summer so have patience , may be hat with young children .",1
definitely one of the highlights of our trip to paris !,1
we loved every second of our visit here and would definitely recommend going up if you have the chance .,1
"the eiffel tower is a must see in paris , the architecture is just amazing and the view you get when you are upstair is incredible .",1
we enjoyed the trip to the summit and the views .,1
"in the night , the tower lights up with spectacular lighting effects .",1
"for 17 euros to the top we thought it was n't to expensive , because its not every day your at the top of the eiffel tower .",1
e desta vez fiz algo que sempre quis .,1
we paid for access to the summit and me some young antipodean reps at the base of the tower .,1
"words , pictures , movies and descriptions could never do it justice as one must see it for themselves to really take in the awe and beauty of it all .",1
"even though it was freezing we loved every minute of our visit , went to the top !",1
just shake your head or say no and repeat as necessary .,1
they said it was cold and windy .,1
"while in can be enjoyed from the champ de mars , many locations on the seine or the trocadero , experience it by walking around its earthy roots .",1
we came here with push crowded but we were happy at least visit once in our life the landmark of paris .,1
best to book in advanced if you want to go up .,1
"this area was littered , flat , and the souvenir salesmen were pushy .",1
"i did n't go up the tower since the lines were long , but it is worth it just to sit in the park and take some pictures .",1
the streets were empty that early .,1
"so you hear all about how you can not miss the eiffel tower but until you go up in it , you do not know how much those people are right .",1
but here is one tip that i give all my friends ... make reservations online well in advance to dine at restaurant 58 -lrb- on the first floor -rrb- .,1
it was marvelous.there was a huge line by the time we were back down -lrb- 10:30 or 11 -rrb- .,1
the queues can be long but it is worth waiting for .,1
tour guide made all the difference in our experience ... martin is an expert on french history .,1
situated just by the river opposite the tower itself ... : -rrb-,1
i was really disappointed as i so wanted to visit the tower on our short trip .,1
the ques however are mad !,1
"i went the end of march and it was n't busy and yes , very clean .",1
i would recommend .,1
i would recommend visiting during the day and night to give you both perspectives .,1
ticked off my bucket list happily .,1
great value for money,1
night time lighting for eiffel tower beautiful and romantic .,1
we 'd only ever been to the lower platform as part of an organised trip and meal in the restaurant so took this opportunity to go all the way to the top .,1
a beautiful iron sculpture !,1
you can see the paris from the top of the world and to enjoy a coffee there .,1
"it was beautiful , glowing gold and looking majestic .",1
we booked in advance to avoid the queues which i 'm glad we did .,1
also there are washrooms on the 1st floor .,1
i finally had the chance on a long layover .,1
we arrived about 5 minutes late and were ushered to a line to go directly up .,1
i brought it to there attention still the girl never came over .,1
we climbed first two levels to get the sight of paris .,1
the title of my review says it all .,1
"absolutely loved the eiffel tower , and was really pleased that we had booked to go through with a tour group .",1
"stunning view of paris , loved .",1
it still was beautiful .,1
i was n't able to climb up to the summit at the top but the 2nd level is well worth the trip .,1
it 's an parisian landmark that everyone should see,1
"well worth the $ 11 to the 2nd floor , did n't have the guts to go all the way to the top !!",1
the actual lighting stared after 8:00 only and do n't for gate to try the lift .,1
because of the security concerns there were no queues so we go to level two with very little delay .,1
"the view is perfect , but the wind/rain can pose a problem to photographers .",1
tower was lit with the colors of france .,1
i only had views of it from far .,1
it is better to buy entrances in advance .,1
we went up the tour to the very top too ... the views are breathtaking and worth every penny .,1
all lit up is the best .,1
must watch attraction in paris .,1
"the time was right at twilight and so not only did we get to see breathtaking views by day but by the time we were ready to go back down , the lights went on all around us and when we finally made our way out , we were able to view the eiffel tower all lit up at dusk !",1
we enjoyed every minute .,1
we went early and still had to queue for over and hour .,1
i ca n't put my finger but it is magical during the day and especially at night .,1
and you must go to the top .,1
the lines were much shorter at night .,1
"we decided to only go up to the second platform and we decided to walk it , if you 're willing and able to do so i would highly recommend doing so as the queues for the lifts were insane .",1
the lines here are crazy with tickets and insane without tickets .,1
"let me tell you : yes , the place was crowded , and yes , there is people trying to sell you all sorts of souvenirs and stuff -lrb- i confess we reluctantly bought a selfie stick for 7 eur which ended up being super convenient -rrb- .",1
the mighty tower is a fantastic work of engineering you are awestruck as you walk under the structure .,1
"to keep costs low , we climbed the 600 + stairs to the second level .",1
i went there once and asked my girlfriend to marry me .,1
do yourself a favour and book ahead ... do n't leave it to the queues just go straight to the top of this historic monument and savour the views .,1
you will need to buy a combo ticket to have access all the way to the top .,1
so fun to see this landmark in a safe environment !,1
very long queue for the cable car up the tower unfortunately,1
"of course it 's crowded , and a tourist trap .",1
save yourself the trip,1
"nonetheless , a romantic and awesome encounter !",1
i arrived on bastille day and got to see they fireworks display which were about 30 minutes long and very impressive .,1
it truly was worth it to book the skip the line : eiffel tower tickets and small-group tour ahead of time .,1
be early in the morning to avoid lines or late in the afternoon to enjoy the sunset .,1
thoroughly enjoyed our stay in paris !,1
there 's a light show on the tower every hour .,1
"here we were provided with a lunch at restaurant 58 , loved it .",1
take the stairs first and then the elevator .,1
i booked a skip the line summit tour of the eiffel tower .,1
the view -lrb- even from the second level -rrb- is amazing .,1
at night make sure you go at the top of the hour for the show .,1
access has changed in recent years as security has immensely tightened up .,1
"do n't forget the glass floor , very cool !",1
it is worth it !,1
i 'm a cheapo so we took the stairs .,1
snacks conveniently available .,1
get on top during the daytime .,1
would love to visit again in nicer weather .,1
"the views were amazing , the architecture immense and all working staff extremely friendly !",1
"well if you are visiting one of the wonders of the world , be prepared to wait in really long queue .",1
"oh , so you can call the guide ?",1
did n't go up the tower because we were trying to get away from the street touts and felt vulnerable .,1
an impressive structure and good views .,1
"it 's fantastic , just go and day and night you have to see this !",1
but not tour it .,1
but it seems more romantic to just sit off to the side in a park and enjoy the view from afar .,1
unfortunately did not visit at night .,1
the lift rides are just as exciting as being at the top .,1
-lrb- starts every hour from 7pm -rrb- .,1
really the title says it all .,1
it is still mighty and enjoyable from the ground but i doubt it worths that 17 eur to go to the top floor .,1
"i had pre-purchased tickets to the top , but the second level was high enough for me .",1
great experience only disappointed with the lack of grass around the parl level grounds .,1
as far as you could go .,1
"we went around the trocadero , the museum of man , and the walked past the tower and upto invalides .",1
make sure if it 's winter time you have warm jackets and comfortable shoes .,1
rightly awarded one of the wonders of the world !,1
"nice to see from a distance , but not worth engaging closer up and fighting the tourist crowds !",1
"during the dark hours , the tower is illuminated and on the hour , every hour , the tower sparkles .",1
security checks -lrb- 2 -rrb- and then you get into the elevator .,1
while we were there a huge soccer ball was hanging in the middle of the tower to signify the euro soccer cup matches that were soon to take place .,1
if you arrive after 8.30 am you will spend hours -lrb- really hours -rrb- in the queue as coach loads of visitors just pour into the square .,1
or whatever you find magical ... it .,1
i even managed to go to the top which all i can say is ` wow ' .,1
"from there , they purchased tickets to ride the lift up to the very top .",1
so glad to use that time seeing the sights instead of in line .,1
go at dusk and watch the city light up .,1
could return a thousand times .,1
the eiffel tower is beautiful !,1
be aware you ca n't take any liquids inside when visiting the tower .,1
we went around 8:30 pm and there were no lines .,1
also watch your things because people will try to scan your bag or pickpocket you .,1
"from the tower you 'll have views of major paris landmarks such as the arc de triomphe , the louvre , the seine river , the sacre coeur in montmartre , and much more.also do n't forget to bring a camera , as you 'll probably want to take more than a couple of pictures .",1
walking down from the 2nd level to the 1st was a surprise delight .,1
we took lift to go to 2nd floor then we took the stairs to go to 3rd floor .,1
strongly recommend .,1
"last minute decision for a visit to the eiffel tower and champagne for my birthday girl , could not prebook tickets , but not too long to queue and get in , the very top was closed when we paid our ticket , but all was well , we could proceed 30minutes later from the 2 .",1
while coming down from second to ground level we used the stairs and i recommend all to do this little adventure .,1
"when you are standing at its base and look straight up , it takes your breath away .",1
france means the eiffel tower to most tourists and a visit to the place does not disappoint.normally the tickets are for the first deck but going to the top deck is recommended -lrb- you need to pay extra -rrb- .,1
"if you have energy , use the staircases and see the inside the structure , the line for the tickets is much shorter .",1
"this is a tourist trap , but a tourist trap worth getting trapped in .",1
"if you actually watch it from the garden of pallais de chaillot it is better -lrb- go at night -rrb- , also you can see it through the concorde square if you take the carousel during the day .",1
the problem is to go to the top .,1
nicest to approach from trocadero when tower lights are about to lit .,1
1 am .,1
"i recommend seeing during the day , but also at night time where you can often catch the light show .",1
the views are amazing and as the the sun goes down paris lights up .,1
so we just walked to the champs de mars one april evening .,1
and be careful of street vendors trying to push their products on you around the eiffel tower,1
"my family and i walked up the first part , which is a much shorter line than the one for the elevator all the way and it costs a bit less too .",1
yes it is the eiffel tower and of course you have to go if you have n't .,1
"stopping next halfway down , taking a walk around the tower , on a much lower view gave you a sense of just how high you had been .",1
this remain from the world exhibition in 1898 built by mr eiffel is just as great as you think it is .,1
if you go in paris you should visit the tour eiffel !!,1
it was windy .,1
"get there a bit early for daytime photo ops , and then post up for the on-the-hour sparkles that happen after sunset !",1
the highlight for me was nike .,1
we 'll do it another time .,1
the view from above is awesome .,1
lovely little shops on the floors and i especially love the glass shop where you can have your photo taken and engaged into glass - beautiful !,1
it took us only about 40 minutes of waiting as opposed to the 1-2 hours for the elevator lines .,1
you can feel the wind and on the top of the world .,1
it was a little foggy so it drifted in and out of a fog shroud .,1
10/10 will visit to the top again .,1
must have cash for taxi .,1
one of the iconic sights of paris .,1
do n't rush down !!,1
it 's really about saying you were there .,1
it is a must do !,1
really good trip to do whiles at paris .,1
you can always sit in the lawns opposite the tower and enjoy the view .,1
it is open up to 11pm most nights but check before you go .,1
"the staff can speak english , and there are signs etc with english on them too .",1
but to get to the top we had to stay 1 hour in que .,1
there was even a short time that it had sparkling lights for about 15 minutes and that was lovely .,1
you can see the shimmering lights on the tower .,1
be wary of people asking you to sign petitions as they are just trying to distract you from pick pockets .,1
they are obvious if you pay attention .,1
a bit of a circus atmosphere at night .,1
"we had numerous teenagers approach us asking to borrow pens , etc. and trying to get me to open my purse or my husband to get his wallet out .",1
most romantic destination paris and on top of that most romantic place eiffel tower .,1
we didnt climbed but had a picnic in the park around it .,1
really cool .,1
but there were way too many vendors selling mini eiffel souvenirs to the point of irritation .,1
we had to book for fast pass online -lrb- very important no to wait in lines if you are traveling with kids -rrb- .,1
if you would ask if it 's crowed ?,1
"if you book early -lrb- months ahead -rrb- , you can also enjoy a wonderful 5-star dinner in the le jules verne restaurant .",1
after a while we realised that we were in the queue for the lift and it was hardly moving so we dispatched one of our sons to see if any of the other queues were moving any better .,1
the eiffel tower needs no review .,1
nice ... do n't miss the famous paris landmark .,1
"loved it from every angle , so glad we bought the beat the queue tickets , saved lots of time .",1
our 7 year old daughter loved it .,1
now have to convince my mother to do it too !,1
over 3 hours in a queue to get to the top .,1
we forgot to take water and bought it on the first level and it was pretty pricey so plan ahead and take some up .,1
there is a place near by where you can board boats and enjoy the scenery from the water .,1
"suggest to spend minimum half day , and see lighted tower at night",1
"must see , but beware , can be very busy , you can reserve tickets in advance , but can also always buy at the eiffeltower , but cahnces of long ques are very real .",1
simply a must see at day time as well as night time when visiting paris .,1
"anything is really less that what you see from there , it 's really huge and impressive , from the top the view it 's amazing and you have the option of restaurant in the second level if you want .",1
then as it turns to night the lights are amazing .,1
"as the title mentions , photos do no justice to the eiffel tower .",1
cest la vie ...,1
take the lift to the summit and step outside .,1
you should try to get there early before they open .,1
a great feeling of celebration every night .,1
"it lights up every full hour , for 5 minutes .",1
telescopes are paid ones .,1
you get immediate lift access which is great ; if you buy tickets there you have to take the stairs all the way up unless you buy a lift pass as well .,1
"be careful , many people are waiting to go upstairs",1
i eventually made my way over and it really was not so scary .,1
splash out on the summit tickets !,1
amazing views and an iconic monument .,1
"also on the first floor you can find a cafe , ice-skating and the transparent floor area from where you can see everything underneath .",1
it 's amazing,1
but be prepared to wait with the other 100s of tourists .,1
amazing at night and just before it closes the light flash and can be seen from miles away .,1
we could n't go to paris without paying a visit to the this fabulous landmark .,1
in december they have a noel village which is a cool little open air market .,1
one of the gates seemed to have less crowd and said escalaiter or something like that .,1
unfortunately i went after the european league and the surroundings were just ugly and dry .,1
"if you have the chance bring binoculars , it only enhances the experience .",1
"if you can , buy your tickets online as the queues are long and frustrating .",1
"we , like all tourists to paris , stopped by the eiffel tower to snap a tourist selfie an see one of the most famous monuments in the world .",1
"get tickets for skip the line , it 's definitely worth it .",1
"we did n't book in advance so had about an hour in the queue to get up , so i would recommend you book tickets in advance .",1
at nightine the lighst are awesone .,1
we arrived at night and we saw the magnificent eiffel tower !,1
it started raining soon after but we spent some more time in a coffee shop nearby and when the weather cleared walked around some more .,1
"to save time , you can make online booking beforehand .",1
so pretty !,1
very secure .,1
signs everywhere about pick pockets but we had no trouble .,1
"we did n't actually go up but it is paris and if you have n't been before , you have to see it .",1
it was lovely and seeing the lights sparkle while actually on the second level was an unforgettable experience .,1
again this spectacular .,1
i was told not to do this - touristy .,1
we enjoyed one of the restaurants there and were very surprised with how good the friend and drinks were .,1
we saw it during the day on a walking tour and then went back at night for the light show .,1
you can not understand how big the eiffel tower is until you stand under it .,1
worth visiting .,1
"i 'd been up the eiffel tower once before , in winter , but the summit was closed due to bad weather .",1
my wife and i first visited the eiffel tower on friday 26th august and decided against actually going up it .,1
enjoyed the views .,1
downside is aggressive touts attempting to sell tourists rubbishy souvenirs and potential to have you pocket picked in the lifts .,1
an amazing place to go .,1
the view is amazing from the top .,1
i was very extremely impressed by the sheer size and mass of this great landmark .,1
we did the night tour and it was spectacular !,1
you see the eiffel tower on photos and you dream that one day you can go inside and get a great view .,1
be prepared with nice warm jacket if you are there in winter as its really cold and windy,1
i recommend visiting the eiffel tower but not going on top and instead spend your frugal budget on better places,1
we took a city tour of paris that included the eiffel tower on a layover .,1
"ten days later , we received another email informing us that our tickets had been automatically refunded to our credit card and we did n't have to do anything extra .",1
there is a small gift shop and a nice restaurant that takes reservations .,1
i would avoid the holiday season if you do n't want to see to much people .,1
it 's a crowded tourist attraction taking much more trouble and money then it 's worth .,1
it was awesome to see them light it up for berlin as well .,1
we arrived there 10 minutes early and went right to the area which was obviously marked for tickets with reservations .,1
enjoyed the entire trip from museum to eiffel tower .,1
the eiffel tower was by far my favourite experience .,1
loads of restaurants and attractions near it .,1
there was something special about sharing this experience with my family .,1
obviously a one-of-a-kind experience .,1
the 3rd floor was very overcrowded but the view and experience was worth it .,1
"of course , this is an individual choice .",1
also loved the jump on and off bus all over paris .,1
great walking from the greenery to the water fountain in front of trocadero .,1
would also reccommedn staying around to see it at night was fabulous !,1
"we took the elevators to the top , and we had snow flurries at 900 feet above the champs de mars , so be prepared for a little colder weather if you go to the top .",1
we all loved it .,1
but the eiffel tower itself holds so much beauty .,1
"did the same boat cruise but by night , knew then why they called paris the city of lights , make sure u see it by night , we we did it was sparkling like a diamond .",1
we had a nice dinner at 58 tour eiffel restaurant .,1
we managed to go on a day when the lines were rather short and the tower was n't overcrowded .,1
we went at night and it was beautiful - very crowded though .,1
"we went to the first two levels then paid on the 2nd level to get to the top , the final trip to the summit is very good as it seems to last for ages .",1
keep your valuables safe someone put their hand in my pocket .,1
i was the highlight of his trip to paris .,1
the glass floor is scary stuff !!!,1
watch out for the pick pockets working the tourist at the base of the tower .,1
just make sure you charge your camera/phone .,1
"you can go to the second floor and the view is good , but if you catch the second elevator not only are you rewarded with an incredible view but you can see eiffels apartment where he hosted guests -lrb- note do not follow this suggestion if you have a fear of heights -rrb- .",1
the lights sparkle every hour for 5min when the night is up .,1
pre book a tour .,1
"you will be delighted , entertained , thrilled and excited .",1
the temptation of going to see and climb it started growing from that moment .,1
"we did n't want to go up in the tower , it was just as fun hanging out outside it",1
the next few days had sore muscles but i would do it again .,1
on a clear day you can see all of paris from there and there are binocular machines too if you want to get closer .,1
"the visitors can reach the different levels by taking lifts , a true technical feat of the time .",1
champagne at the top at exorbitant prices per glass !,1
"the worst thing , which ca n't be helped , is the crowds .",1
reservations should have been made months in advance .,1
the sun was out on a cold december day - beautiful view and the added bonus of the christmas market meant i could warm up with a chocolat chaud .,1
do yourself a favour and make sure you do .,1
the views are amazing day or night .,1
"charming , elegant and huge .",1
bonjour .,1
the history is interesting .,1
brilliant tour and wonderful views of paris true romance .,1
"i have never been on the top of the tour , because i never want to wait on line for it.but even from the bottom of the tower it is breath taking , beautiful and grandiose .",1
"once we finished the hard climb we then wandered around the 2nd level , had a glass of champas and a macaron and enjoyed the view .",1
i checked for about 2 months before our trip but we were n't able to get tickets online .,1
but i advice you to visit paris not in summer season .,1
we did n't bother to go up this time .,1
what a magical experience !,1
the lit of tower is splendid and the view of paris from atop is second to none .,1
went to this iconic attraction this year and was just amazed how they built this incredible structure .,1
we went on a guided tour which ended at the 2nd floor lift to the summit .,1
"a definite `` must see '' when in paris , this attraction is best visited in good weather !",1
"you can walk down from metro -lrb- mrt -rrb- around 10 ~ 15minutes , nearby have a shop sell souvenir too , but only one stand shop .",1
"the elevators make life easy , but there are long waiting lines .",1
next time i 'm in paris i 'm gon na have to check out the towers restaurant !,1
remarkable that this edifice was built in 1889 .,1
a very long wait for something that is over rated .,1
we 'll be back soon !,1
"very nice , can see the whole sightview of ancient paris , the kid like go there , but the ticket queue is so long , i do n't know whether there is some booking on internent , then guests can get easy acess to the tower",1
we had a 12 hour layover flying back from spain so we left the airport and took a cab to see the eiffel tower at night .,1
watch out for pickpockets in august .,1
the lines were pretty long that day -lrb- over two hour wait -rrb- .,1
arrived at 9 ; 30 but by the time we got to the ticket office at 10 ; 30 they had closed the top of the tower so could n't get tickets to that stage .,1
i recommend being there on the hour when the lights twinkle !,1
"we arrived on a cold , wet october morning and to our delight there was not a single person in the queue -lrb- probably because you could n't see the top due to low cloud -rrb- .",1
the eiffel tower is obviously a must when in paris .,1
but once you are up you have a very beautifull view of paris.the souvenirs are very expensive inside .,1
but it 's the eiffel tower !,1
the best part is it 's clean and tourist friendly .,1
it also does not get dark until about 8:45 at night .,1
so be prepared to queue .,1
"i bought a lot of souvenir from the tower because i wanted to support the tower , it is amazing to be able to go to the top .",1
still must wait to get up elevators once in .,1
i would recommend using a tour because you skip the very long line to get into the tower .,1
my wife wanted a photo shoot at the eiffel tower and after searching for a professional photographer we hire ari bafalouka at paris tours photo and portraits and it was the best thing we did .,1
we were amazed to see all the people who were gathered there in long lines to go up the elevators to view paris from the tower .,1
there was too much of a line to get in -lrb- also at the louvre -rrb- but you may get to pre purchase .,1
it is worth the ride to the top .,1
awesome to finally see : -rrb-,1
had a good experience walking up to the second level but the queue was so long to get a ticket to go the top and then another queue for the lift .,1
we went to the second floor and enjoyed the scenery .,1
"be careful of pickpockets , they are all.over paris",1
excellent place to go you have to do it if your in paris,1
i love the feeling when i walk upon the tower .,1
i love the military presence near the tower in order to protect the visitors and locals .,1
"very nice :-rrb- we were here in valentines day , but we didnt go up , because there was milion people : / we stay 2 hours and its never ends ...",1
beware of pick pocketers .,1
"in the end , he only charged for me and my wife , but then swore at us as we left .",1
the eiffel tower is a must see - an icon in world monuments .,1
"what can you say , news year eve in paris at the eiffel tower .",1
i do not like heights but i managed this very well .,1
do not miss to go to the top most floor .,1
i do n't know if you have to climb it .,1
"it is a signature building of paris and as some of our party had not been to paris before , we included it in our program .",1
"if it is a bucket list , please do it and do it with special ones because it will always remain in your memories",1
this place is so well known clouded of tourist but still be attractive point .,1
it was a beautiful day and the views of paris were breathtaking .,1
typical paris .,1
"we took our 14 year old daughter on our first day in paris , just so she would n't keep asking to go all week .",1
tourists come in thousands .,1
such lovely views definitely recommend stairs were a killer but well worth it once we got to the second floor we took a lift to the top and the views were amazing !,1
"while in the second lift , i was regretting our choice to go to the top , but it was ok once i got out .",1
"we decided to walk up to second stage to avoid very long queue , if you ca n't face 704 steps each way then pre book lift !",1
"obviously , i understand that security is paramount at the moment but it 's such a shame to admire such a magnificent monument and have it ruined by the sites of police , military and metal fences .",1
i stood in awe of such a huge grand structure,1
"did not buy tickets online , as they seemed too expensive .",1
its just steel but put together in a way that lifts it to the level of a beauty .,1
"it is huge , and given the age of it -lrb- 127 years -rrb- , it is remarkably well preserved .",1
the night views of paris were tremendous .,1
the light show on the eiffel tower is beautiful .,1
"i like to see it from afar , like when i 'm on the juncture of rue soufflot and rue st. jacques , rather than to go to the near proximity of the tower .",1
views was beautiful but would of like to go to the top .,1
this is a must do attraction hen in paris .,1
had n't visited to the tower for some years and the first thing that was noticeable was that it is now fully cordoned off and security is tight .,1
starting at 9 pm until 12 every hour the lights twinkle .,1
we went on a tuesday evening and only waited a few minutes for security and maybe 20 minutes for tickets and the elevator ride .,1
the sight seeing is incredible and you can never run out of things to do .,1
"but , the tour guide provided some good information about the tower that we did not know , which was cool .",1
instead it is thousands of people on trampled grass -lrb- dirt -rrb- with pushy vendors and scammers trying to get you to purchase something .,1
was definitely worth it .,1
hundreds of people were queued up in a snaking long line at the foot of the tower .,1
i love visiting the eiffel tower !,1
we chose the cruise very refreshing after a meal and at he end of of a hot summers day .,1
tower is big and surrounded by nice gardens .,1
we reached at about 9 am .,1
what a sight and what an engineering marvel .,1
visiting the iconic eiffle tower was indeed a fabulous experience .,1
we took the subway to get to the eifel tower and was disappointed .,1
"while it has an industrial and dated look to it , it 's classical paris style and of course synonymous with france and paris , very pretty at night .",1
"reservations must be made well in advance to gain access to elevator , 2 - 3 months ahead during peak times",1
"if the lines to go up to the third level scare you off , do n't worry , save the extra 6 euro and time in queues , it 's the same views , just from a bit higher up .",1
"anyway , no stress if you are on tourism",1
it is crowded .,1
when we got to the bottom the lights on the tower started to twinkle and everyone cheered .,1
so hard to get it in one shot !,1
i did n't find it much attractive .,1
we did not try the restaurant .,1
once we reach the tower 2nd level or even 3rd level the paris city views are breath taking .,1
great night-time views of paris,1
it is definitely worth to pre-book to save all your time and get direct entry to the attraction in no time !,1
definitely worth going to up to see the views which were amazing .,1
"but be aware , its cold up there !",1
we seen it from a river seine cruise which also bought discounted on paris attractions !,1
go there !,1
"we walked here from our hotel - and enjoyed walking around , and taking pictures .",1
"it was my bday on the 21st and my in laws were kind enough to give me , as a present , a dinner reservation at 58 restaurant .",1
all of my respect for sir eiffel !!!,1
the starts were an easy climb - and you can do them at your own pace .,1
"more than a symbol of paris , the eiffel tower will give you an amazing view on that wonderful city .",1
"went with my family and it was amazing and had champagne on top of the eiffel tower followed by pizza , excellent service and great place to visit .",1
you can go up in it - look for tickets online !!,1
a must see attraction in paris .,1
february was a great time to go visit .,1
"got here around 4pm , found out the crowd is not too large as we thought , get into the line , within just less an half hour we already get onto its lift .",1
just a beautiful site to experience .,1
it is as iconic and identifiable as any structure in the world .,1
"during the holidays , we got to ice skate in the 1st floor .",1
the sun came out right as we got there .,1
fantastic views and we had good weather for it .,1
it is a very impressive piece of engineering and design .,1
the view form the very top is spectacular .,1
"i 've been up the eiffel tower a number of times , in different seasons , and enjoyed each visit .",1
our friend who walked up to the first level only waited a few minutes for his ticket then was able to hop on an elevator from there to the top .,1
this was our first trip to paris -lrb- hopefully there will be more ! -rrb-,1
great with a small group on tour .,1
one way to enjoy it is to view it from the river cruise which is very romantic .,1
chatting with others while in line is wonderful .,1
you need a combo ticket to take the elevator to the very top .,1
"the tower itself is amazing , the big structure , but when it comes dark it lights up and it ´ s magic , for the first 10 minutes you have to be there and see it sparkling ...",1
its paris .,1
"i was prepared for the queues , but was pleasantly surprised .",1
some are stairs and the other lift .,1
do you not miss out,1
no big words needed to describe .,1
"went to right to the summit at night , what a view .",1
we had a great night view from the arc de triumph .,1
very beautiful !!,1
the views of paris are beautiful .,1
romantic nevertheless !!,1
"we had a pre booked ticket to go to the top , though it was crowded it was well organized .",1
"beautiful building , amazing view , nice restaurant with great food , nice souvenir shops .",1
"wonderful experience of course , beautiful .",1
it was so much easier and we did not waste time standing in queues .,1
i hope everything is ok . '',1
you do have to buy tickets to go up in the tower .,1
go visit with your family and it is a memory for a lifetime !!!!,1
i suggest also visiting the eiffel summit is something should be greatly considered .,1
we watched two couples get engaged at the top .,1
"it 's a must do , get there early to avoid insane crowds .",1
when you go to paris i would recommend touring the eiffel tower but it is extremely crowded and can be difficult snapping pictures .,1
"good footwear recommended , of course .",1
"it was a very hot day in august , expect to get a suntan waiting in line .",1
"there are shops , cafe and bar at level 1 to chill out .",1
beware of pick pockets !,1
wonderful visit to an icon of paris .,1
although we were pushed for time we decided to queue to go up the tower & boy was it an experience .,1
my interest in paris has never been there .,1
and a bottle of water from a vendor anywhere within half a kilometer is going to cost you your child 's university tuition .,1
the view from eiffel tower is amazing but bear in mind that there is always a very long queue to wait .,1
f.i. .,1
it was gorgeous seeing the tower lit and sparkling whilst we were stood under it .,1
"long queues , and after almost an hour queueing in the hot sun we were informed that we could only go up to the first floor as there were far too many people at the top and they were closing it off !!",1
we also saw it lit up at night such was nice .,1
"be very careful about pickpockets as you leave , though -- we saw a gang of pre-teens hassling some older tourists , and they tried to give us a hard time at the metro station .",1
erected in 1889 for the world 's fair .,1
it 's like being under a transformer !,1
great and finally you have to be their once for your lift time ... the crowd is amazing and the tower is great and after all the photos and video you should personally be there and feel it .,1
the views are breath taking .,1
it 's fantastic !,1
would also recommend a glass of champagne at the top !,1
going to the top takes time but it is worth it .,1
if you stay on the summit until 9pm you can witness the twinkling while on the tower .,1
ok so i overpaid and uses the tour to buy tickets if you plan ahead of time you can get the tickets much cheaper .,1
the champs de mars is fenced off as well .,1
do n't carry heavy backpacks or bags .,1
"really made our trip to paris , and those views !!!!!",1
the food in the lunch menu is really nice and overall the service is great .,1
the eiffel tower is just completely amazing .,1
one of the most romantic places to visit .,1
it was very cold and windy when we went so wrap up warm .,1
then went into airport style second search .,1
we were late by 5 min cause of stopped train .,1
we found views of paris better from the top of basilica_du_sacre_coeur_de_montmartre for only $ 7 and no ques .,1
romantic and stunning .,1
"off down the street we walked , still not exactly sure where it was , but the excitement was building .",1
the eiffel tower is always amazing .,1
this is the best attraction in paris !,1
it is great example of useless and beautiful architecture : -rrb-,1
would i go again for 3rd time try my luck ??,1
we all climbed to the second floor for fabulous views of the city .,1
there are many pickpockets !,1
"i recommend not to look at it , really scared me for life .",1
it was amazing to see the eiffel tower in person .,1
booked a tour to see the tower .,1
... every hour for five minutes ... the eiffel tower sparkles !,1
"when we walked down the steps from one floor to another , the twinkly lights came on while we were in the stairwell !",1
must go up on the two different kinds of lifts and enjoying the panoramic 360 degree view of paris city in four different levels are sensational on a clear day .,1
it truly is romantic in its own way .,1
the empire state building was much better .,1
you must go to see la tour eiffel if you go to paris !,1
"i am an engineer , so i may be biased , but i love to spent time at the eiffel tower every time i visit paris .",1
great view of the city and its history,1
"beware you have to book in advance for the very top and if you leave it too late , only the agencies have -lrb- expensive -rrb- tickets .",1
"we spent hours up there , checking the sunset , drinking wine and celebrating , checking the museums , cafes , elevators , open air stairs , fountains , glass floors etc. .",1
the engineering used for the elevator is still used today .,1
i was speechless when i saw the eiffel tower .,1
fantastic experience and so big when your there .,1
we combined our trip to the tower with a boat ride .,1
the engineering still amazes me .,1
we also watched the light show at night which was very nice .,1
it has clean comfort toilet at the top .,1
did n't t go up the tower but the area around the base is a tourists nightmare .,1
"it 's the symbol of france , an amazing structure with an amazing story .",1
i considered buying tickets online in advance but did n't want to be committed to a certain day and time .,1
the day i was there it was a 2 hour wait if you wanted to ride the elevator from the ground level up to the top of the tower .,1
the tower is huge !,1
the is the most iconic place of paris ... the first things to see on your list when visit paris .,1
i left it to late to get tickets but after some research we decided to wing it .,1
but go !,1
"lunch was decent , but you do n't go for the food , you go for the view .",1
"river cruise , louvre , and eiffel tower .",1
way too many peace signing selfie stick idiots ... they ruin so much with their antics ...,1
i sat beneath and waited for them - did n't have to pay to just sit there .,1
the first time i saw the eiffel tower i was awestruck .,1
the tower of love must be visited once in life .,1
was up it when i first went over to paris 10 + years ago .,1
i had tried to book tickets in advance but due to the euro2016 football championships they were blocked from 20 jun through 20 jul. .,1
"we took the car to the second floor deck for photos which were of 10,000 french football fans in the fan zone .",1
enjoyed the lift ride up the tower and the views from the second level .,1
i would visit at both day and night !,1
the views are terrific .,1
incredible the size when you are up close .,1
i was really breathtaken by the eiffel tower as it was even more beautiful and incredible than i had ever imagined .,1
walk up the stairs to save time since line for elevator is so long .,1
we used a fat tire tour and sophie was so informative .,1
"me and my brother backpacked europe , and the eiffel tower was a must !",1
we were cheated by our tour operator paris city vision office .,1
"to get to the top of tower , one must take the lift , and the bookings have to be made at least a month in advance .",1
we have been to the very top and found the view expansive but lost in the vastness .,1
"it can be romantic , kid friendly , a family or friend adventure or even something to enjoy all on your own .",1
"he confomred with a wry smile that it was , indeed , la tour eiffel .",1
it was one of the highlights of the trip .,1
not to miss the light show every night after dark ti .,1
"since this is a review about eiffel tower , and rightly so , a 5 - star experience !",1
it was beautiful views as always .,1
"if we went back would just get timed entry to second floor , the views were equally impressive without the wait .",1
"wonderful views , best to book a ticket in advance to save queuing , which good well be a nightmare when busy .",1
but we did it .,1
i would suggest taking the lift down one level then taking the stairs .,1
but we very much enjoyed our visit .,1
you are expecting beautiful long gardens and all you will see is fence dirt over crowded with tourist and pit pockets .,1
"with many masterpieces of architecture and significance spring out in the world all over , this tower does not look very impressive now days -lrb- neither the building nor the view -rrb- how ever it maintains its historical importance and when a tourist visits paris is impossible to omit a visit here .",1
because i went late in the afternoon i was able to see everything from day light and night which was a bonus .,1
views from all floors of the tower are just amazing .,1
"takes a while to reach the top - especially if you choose walking , but the view is gorgeous .",1
we had reservations for 5:30 pm which enabled us to see the view before the sun went down and after .,1
walked till the second floor i.e 700 steps and then took the elevator to the 3rd floor i.e the top floor .,1
"the elevator is thrilling , the stairs are fun allowing for great pictures and unusual angles of view of the tower .",1
"once you get up there , it 's amazing .",1
you can then say you 've done it .,1
maybe the next trip !,1
the tower in itself is iconic .,1
"be patient , as it 's tight quarters as soon as you get into your first elevator .",1
great views all round .,1
"i did n't go up all the way , but it was still cool .",1
"the view was incredible from the second floor , but the kids wanted to go up to the top .",1
we arrived about 4pm and happily found the entry line was only about 30 minutes .,1
"and , we really did skip all lines.the tour guides were wonderful , knowledgable , patient and kind .",1
the eiffel tower is truly my favorite thing in paris .,1
whilst the queues are long and it takes a while to ascend it is certainly worth the wait !,1
my son was born in montpellier .,1
; o -rrb-,1
we had to buy a cheap bottle opener since even if we had thought to bring one i do n't know that it could go through airport security .,1
with a massive smile on my face i was able to fully enjoy the majesty of the view the eiffel tower offers .,1
"went early evening , -lrb- probably the best time to get the effect of the lights -rrb- , queues were still quite long .",1
the eiffel tower is a must .,1
gustave eiffel 's world famous 325 meter steel latticed structure shall remain unsurpassed forever .,1
coming down walked some of the way .,1
"amazing experience , just not so great if you suffer with heights !",1
it is simply a fascinating site .,1
"there are souvenirs and food cafes at the middle , -lrb- 1st stop -rrb- and top , end stop .",1
take your time taking pictures from different differences and angles .,1
loved how the lights would start flashing on the hour .,1
bring your wide angle lens if you 've got one .,1
was n't too busy and you have a good amount of wind up there so ensure that you bring something warm up .,1
"amazing to be there , there was an hour wait to get in , i was aware you could pre-purchase tickets , but decided it was just enough to be there",1
we visited the tower at night .,1
"we took the lift up half way as it was too windy to go to the top unfortunately , still it was a fabulous experience and the view was simply breath-taking .",1
"paris is one of the hardest cities to find restrooms in , but their is one at the base of the tower behind southeast corner , it was the shortest line we found for a public restroom , the wait for women was about 20 mins .",1
you can drive for 4 euros on the first floor of the eiffel tower and then walk up to the second for free .,1
i bought tickets online before i went which made the queue only a few minutes .,1
what else can you say about the eiffel tower except iconic .,1
the early bird catches the worm the oldies say ... .,1
we queued for 2hrs just for tickets .,1
it opens 3 months before you visit and tickets will sell out online within a few hours of being released however if you get pre booked tickets the queues are a lot shorted -lrb- nearly walk on to be honest -rrb- .,1
i recommend a lunch on the second level at a sit-down restaurant .,1
nothing in paris will offer you a better view .,1
beware of all the vendors selling knock offs and the gypsies trying to pickpocket you .,1
"you have n't seen paris until you see the view from the top of the eiffel tower , especially at night .",1
we choose to walk to the first and second falls which tends to be quicker than waiting for the lift .,1
the great thing about it is the park that surrounds it .,1
we went there after sunset to catch the sight and again during the day .,1
there are two restaurants for dining .,1
"pricing is also very reasonable , 2 adults worked out to be about $ 14 which i thought was very good .",1
beware of vendors harnessing you non stop and large crowds .,1
"we signed up for a tour with our family of eleven , and were glad we did .",1
we took the elevator up and some in our group walked down the 700 steps .,1
"we visited it as part of a tour , which i highly recommend .",1
everyone should visit paris and the eiffel tower must never be missed .,1
you can go up 3 levels but have to pay extra for the 3rd floor .,1
we arrived around 9:15 am and waited in line till the 9:30 opening .,1
an even longer wait for the top floor .,1
"ok so this is in every guide book , blog and travel guide site , and for good reason !",1
no trip to paris would be complete without a visit to the eiffel tower !,1
we continued to have a good day !,1
my only regret is that we did n't have the chance to experience it at night - but we will be doing that this summer !,1
"on the one clear day we had , we went there for it opening and had no problem accessing the tower within 10 minutes of arrival .",1
"after hours of lineup , and several security checks , we got up to the top , but could not wait to come down immediately and be somewhere warm .",1
but yeah i did it again,1
"seriously , who needs a review for eiffel tower if you are visiting paris .",1
the only complaint i have is the very aggressive street vendors at the exit .,1
it was nice not to have to cue up until it was time to get the elevator to the top .,1
opposite from the observation deck of trocadero gardens you can get lovely pictures .,1
i believe everyone in his life should visit eiffel tower at least once .,1
"definitely go , and enjoy yourself .",1
truly beautiful .,1
my favourite place on earth !,1
smaller in person .,1
this time we took botabus & saw all places of interest .,1
we enjoyed a night time visit to the tower and watched from the upper levels as the lights of the city came on as the sun set .,1
expect long lines and crushing crowds .,1
it was a beautiful sight to see the eiffel tower illuminated in particular the lighting that happens every hour .,1
this entry just does stairs to the second level but it was a great experience and good value .,1
beware of hordes of people selling cheap wine or beer and cheap eiffel tower replicas .,1
amazing views and you can climb a floor higher for another 360 degree view .,1
both times to the top .,1
"the line , if you did n't pre-purchase , was maybe 1.5 hours long or longer !",1
nowadays it is nothing special .,1
in a short space of time the kindness of one employee -lrb- and encouragement from my husband and son -rrb- has given me the most amazing day and experience .,1
going from the 2nd to 3rd floor elevator we did n't wait at all but i imagine it gets busy at times .,1
"obviously paris ' most known landmark , the views of both the city and the tower 's construction are worth the price of the elevator ride .",1
"we made it to the summit of the eiffel tower and was amazing the views of paris was spectacular , we then had lunch at the tower restaurant and the food was outstanding .",1
"yeah people tell that you should visit eiffel tower when you get to paris , now i know , why they suggested me to visit there !",1
"i do n't like heights , so i probably wo n't be doing that very often .",1
who would have thought ?!,1
it does n't disappoint .,1
we did a skip the line tour that included a boat ride on the seine .,1
"magnificent in some ways , but the massive queues will take the shine off of the experience .",1
go for it .,1
there 's a lot of them .,1
we arrived at 10:30 and the lines had thinned .,1
this was no doubt due to the fact that the european soccer tournament was being held in paris .,1
a huge fantastic structure .,1
"make a visit to this if you are in paris.try watching at night , sparkling lights .",1
we took the elevator ride up and the view was fantastic,1
from there just cross the street and go for a sightseeing cruise on the seine river .,1
the crowds were a bit less and we were able to wait on the second level until the lights of paris came on .,1
if you want to visit prepare to queue and queue and queue .,1
i think that the tower is very over protective .,1
arrived about 9:35 a.m. expecting hoards of people .,1
the eiffel tower is a mandatory tour while in paris !,1
it 's always exciting .,1
very romantic at night but much better in the daytime .,1
a must see location .,1
this experience is worth the time and money .,1
the wheelchair access is further down the street .,1
signs tell you not to buy from them but the authorities would be advised to move them from here because of the numbers of them .,1
but well worth the effort .,1
go for a champagne glass on the top and celebrate .,1
i did n't like being squashed into the lift with as many people as they could fit,1
in fact that applies to every sight in paris .,1
very nice .,1
when we asked for a refund the way we were treated was nothing short of amazing .,1
the ticket counters are always over crowded .,1
and i suggest going there before sunset so you can take both pictures one in the day and one at night with the lights on !,1
buy a ticket in advance .,1
"until you approach the magnificent splendor of the tower , until you are under it and look up at the sky through it , and until you get to the top and stare out at the beauty that is paris , you have no idea what the eiffel tower is all about .",1
i love the eiffel tower !,1
all attractions easy access,1
"just before 10pm , i walked out into the lawns and then the real magic began .",1
"i 'm sure because it is the symbol of my absolute favorite city , but there is something so wonderful about it , visiting and viewing all of paris from within .",1
"possibly a great feat at one time , but now with so many great structures like the burj khalifa , the eiffel tower doesnt enthuse me anymore .",1
it is great experience,1
my wife and i have eaten considerably better food than we had here but we have absolutely no complaints about the standard of catering nor the service other than feeling a little rushed at the end of our allotted 2 hours for the 18.30 sitting however some of our younger friends were ready to go and explore the higher levels of the landmark so off they went .,1
we pre-bought our tickets and thus had a determined arrival time and that seems to work well .,1
but a great experience all the same .,1
"great view from the top , but ultimately not much else going on around .",1
", also , buy the paris city pass .",1
"cost approx 60 euros for 4 adults to the 2nd floor , extra if you go to the top .",1
the structure is jaw dropping .,1
"after the wait they tell you you ca n't pay with your credit card , only cash !",1
i always love to come to this monument .,1
but even the first level access is very high !,1
the view is spectacular when you have good whether .,1
it has impressed me by its length -lrb- height -rrb- and breadth .,1
it 's splendid with the gardens around and the view from up there is really breathtaking .,1
i do recommend a selfie stick !!!,1
there 's always people around it but it was n't too crazy .,1
it is absolutely incredible to be near .,1
"recommended trip ,",1
do n't come to paris and not go see it .,1
would love to go back to paris !,1
"also , save your pennies and get a glass of champagne on the 3rd tier .",1
beautiful during the day magnificent at night .,1
um ... it 's the eiffel tower .,1
we combined the visit to the eiffel tower with the cruise on the seine,1
it is an experience you wo n't forget .,1
this was my girls top thing to do .,1
we pre purchased tickets to go up the tower at night .,1
"we opted for the lift , but did n't have too wait too long .",1
"and i was lucky to see just married couple , and it looked more than romantic .",1
"we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary that night , and all our waiters made us feel so special .",1
the only downside to everything was the amount of tourists but that ca n't be avoided and i went during a peak period in summer .,1
when you try give it back they become worse !,1
cheers and enjoy !!!,1
we decided to come just after sunset since the lines were so long in the daytime .,1
love the eiffel tower .,1
then we stopped for a little something to eat while we waited as the sky darken so we could view this beautiful city as the lights on the bridges and buildings come on .,1
views are great .,1
"the views from the top of the tower are good , but do n't out-weight the experience of being at the top of the tower -lrb- if you get my meaning -rrb- .",1
we purchased a tour ticket with a local company located a short walk away .,1
it 's an incredible sight at night and a marvel of architecture if you visit during the day .,1
"whether it is summer , winter , spring or autumn , eiffel will always show its beauty to every eyes that watching it .",1
keep your valuables in secure pockets and do n't carry wallets in back pockets .,1
we bought tickets online -lrb- not easy -rrb- and the only time available was 9:30 pm .,1
"no need to really go to the second or third level , in my opinion .",1
the tower is great !!,1
one can not but take a lot of photos of the tower on all sides to at least capture the moment in the most fashionable city of the world ... paris .,1
"there is a grocery store about 4 blocks away near the metro station , so grab a cheap meal there and enjoy it on the grass !",1
you have to see it to believe how beautiful it is !!,1
the weather was perfect and the day we decided to go was a monday .,1
"you should give it to visits ; one at night and one in the morning , , , it has a different spirit !",1
"special all the time , but especially all lit up at night .",1
i would definitely recommend going all the way to the top .,1
booking on line was easy and hassle free .,1
you have the choice of levels to visit at increasing prices .,1
you can go to second floor by steps also,1
pay the extra money and buy skip the line or tour to save you time .,1
"also , taking a proper picture of the eiffel tower can prove difficult ; taking many pictures of many people with a lot of selfie sticks much less so .",1
it is very expensive and the queues to wait for access to the top were very long .,1
visited the the eiffel tower for dinner at restaurant 84 as part of a tour group .,1
definitely pre book if you can .,1
it is best to go on a guided tour or you will become very frustrated in the slow long lines and the heat .,1
it took half hour ride from hotel to reach their .,1
"i keep on asking myself why this tower is so special ... is it the story , is it the location , is it the lights at night ?",1
"there are long line-ups , but it 's worth the wait .",1
"the river tour was interesting , but the water level was lower than i expected to see some of the sights .",1
great place to be .,1
"gorgeous and oh , it was dark by then so the lights of the city of light were just beautiful .",1
have cameras ready for a video !,1
"coming down , we did some shopping , some more drinking & eating of macaroons and read about the history of the eiffel and its most famous visitors .",1
i had n't thought to book tickets far enough in advance -lrb- you need to plan 2 months ahead -rrb- .,1
we arrived in the evening with the understanding that our travel agent had booked the reservation for our group but sadly it appeared to have not been done .,1
we have visited before but not since the new security and glass floor .,1
"the most beautiful place when i spent a good time with my wife , the garden , the view , the area , the ambiance , everything near to this place is unbelievable .",1
the large queues for the lift constantly moved along so it was n't too bad .,1
it 's like the line up at universal in the middle of summer with the airport security of a major airport .,1
the temperatures are much more desirable too for those not fond of excessive heat and humidity .,1
"with kids , if you have to do one thing in paris , this is it .",1
"this was my third visit to paris , and also my third visit to the eiffel .",1
fantastic !!,1
when it does sparkle it 's like magic -- reminds you of swarovski crystals shinning bright .,1
you 'll likely see this beauty as you travel the city and will probably find yourself having to walk by it anyway .,1
we had a 12 hour layover in paris during our flight from the united states to south africa .,1
but anyway we enjoyed first floor as well .,1
"the gardens behind are so lovely , excellent for dogs walks , children fun and rest .",1
worth the lines and fee .,1
we were so taken by this beautiful place we almost forgot we had booked online for a tour .,1
i visited this place at morning hours with people rushing in queue for top view .,1
"the eiffel tower provided great views of paris , but the lines were long and the crowds terrible .",1
we did a night tour which i highly recommend .,1
"we came at night , it was a little chilly , but less of a crowd and a wait .",1
"the eiffel tower needs to be viewed twice , once at day , once at night .",1
not pricey for the experience you have .,1
-lrb- apparently the crowds/lines and wait times in the afternoons are easily a couple of hours . -rrb-,1
"it was pretty neat , but the lines were crazy , even during the off season .",1
spectacular viewpoints from all around the eiffel tower .,1
its huge and going to the top is absolutely magnificently awesome !,1
the tower experience is amazing .,1
you must be patient to wait your turn to get to the railing .,1
hard to really say anything new about this one .,1
it cleared up but seeing the city all lit up was perfect .,1
it was great spotting all the sights we had seen at ground level .,1
it 's a must .,1
"i 'll admit i was n't too keen on going up , and it was every bit as scary as i imagined but it was more than worth it when we reached the top",1
the top undoubtedly offers great views of the city .,1
"even though the crowds were overwhelming , it was truly a beautiful sight .",1
you can climb up for free -lrb- at least to the observation deck -rrb- or pay for an incline ride .,1
the detail and size is not what you 'd expect .,1
but i heard you need to be careful about rubbers ... .,1
this popular tourist attraction is now surrounded by armed guards and a chain link fence .,1
this was a great tour of a fascinating structure .,1
we did not go up because there was long queue .,1
must see it to yourself .,1
"these people -lrb- small foreign-looking women , a lot of them -rrb- ask if you speak english , and try to get you read/write something to help them , but it 's a distraction while someone else picks your pocket .",1
we visiting the eiffel tower on a 37 degree day and had to line up for a couple of hours to buy tickets and the another 1 + hour to get on the elevator ... so buy a ticket in advance !,1
stunning as always !,1
we arrived - on good advice - by 8.30 .,1
"stunning views , romantic , inspiring , special .",1
"we pre - purchased our tickets months before , with an assigned time .",1
they had put up another temporary fence around the bottom of the tower because of the euro soccer .,1
we could only go to the second level as the top was closed due to wind .,1
it was all very efficient but we were smashed in like sardines going up and down in the lift .,1
we actually visited this site in 2015 but this application wo n't let you go back more than a year !,1
the only time i will probably ever eat escargot .,1
"the view from up is stunning , definitely worth the visit .",1
arround the tower are shops where you can buy very cheap sandwhiches and drinks .,1
you can see for hundreds of kilometres around paris .,1
the lights on the tower twinkle on the hour for ten minutes .,1
", to which i replied , ` let 's do it ! '",1
lit up at night it is truly something to behold .,1
"we went june 2 , there was only one lift working and with added security for bag/body search -lrb- which is good ! -rrb-",1
"yes , it 's a little tight and the photographer was a little intrusive but it 's still an amazing experience .",1
"the lighting is spectacular and twinkles at , i think , hourly intervals .",1
my husband and younger sister even went to the very tippy top .,1
and so i did !,1
for the great view of paris ; u should go up to tour eiffel ... but u should consider that u will wait on a very long queu for ur turn,1
"you can always have a picnic in the garden surroundings , that is very nice",1
c'est incroyable !,1
the exception - close up .,1
climbing down the stairs was fascinating .,1
"queues were quite long but worth the wait , definitely coming back to go to the top !",1
"ascending to the second and third observation areas is a bit more challenging , oh and harder to visit .",1
second visit to the tower !,1
we used a beat the queue company which was easy to locate and well worth it .,1
were able to get 2 tickets to the summit 2 days before we went at regular prices .,1
but once you see how big it is .,1
taking night pictures of eiffel is always a magical experience .,1
try to go to the top to enjoy the view of metropolitan area .,1
"it is architecturally wonderful and it nice all lit up , and the view is outstanding ... .",1
climb as far as you can by foot - it 's worth it .,1
french engineer gustave eiffel -- already famous for building viaducts and bridges -- spent two years working to erect this iconic monument for the world exhibition of 1889 .,1
you can just go there and queue for 15 minutes and it costs 11 euros well worth it .,1
there were barely people on the que .,1
"since i was a kid , i only admired this place from a distance .",1
"please , please , please be careful here !",1
"fabulous place to visit , but my oh my what long queues , even with a restaurant reservation at a specific time .",1
"did go while the xmas market was on , best to go late afternoon evening as they are late starters",1
it is nice going up to the top but if on a budget the second floor is just as good.would leave a good hour for this .,1
"visiting on a cold , bright december monday morning , in the wake of recent tragic events , the tower still wove its magic on us despite tightened security .",1
sure it is most popular place to see but staying too much as negative feel does n't compentating by feeling when you get on tower .,1
"when in paris , make sure you visit the eiffel tower .",1
it is particularly awesome at night .,1
we ate there .,1
"thanks to our timley booking thru `` skip-the-line '' package , we could have a great trip of eiffel without delays .",1
beautiful once at the top .,1
"our tour included lunch at the restaurant , so we have no idea how much it was ; however , we both enjoyed our lunches .",1
approach the tower via the central path on the place du mars .,1
"believe me you would not move your eyes for a few minutes , its simply mesmerizing and the most beautiful iconic structure .",1
we waited for about 45 minutes to get from the first floor to the very top and it was totally worth it !,1
we went all the way to the sommet .,1
i would definitely recommend getting there early .,1
this time i got online tickets for my family and i .,1
you have to go up in the eiffel tower .,1
well worth the wait to go up the tower but only if its a clear day .,1
recommend going up in the evening right before sunset to enjoy the view while it 's still light and after all the lights come on .,1
"during my paris visit in june 2014 , we booked a tour of the tower through city wonders .",1
canned drinks are not allowed up the tower .,1
took the backstage tour of the eiffel tower .,1
not much - but i can only say that i could look at it for hours !!,1
what can you say the views are just amazing .,1
300 plus stairs to the 1st level and you really get a perspective of the structure .,1
"afterwards , we grabbed food and wine from a few places off of rue cler and sat in the grass looking up at the eiffel tower .",1
not expensive and worth the queue to go up although it was n't too bad as we had n't prebooked tickets .,1
went twice .,1
for example 2.50 euros for a bottle of water which is ` only ' 1.00 euro on street corners and much less in the shops .,1
"it was 2.5 hr wait time when we visited , luckily we had booked a tour which bypassed these queues & is worth considering if time is limited on your visit .",1
our trip to the top of the tower was painless thanks to my wife 's planning .,1
"eiffel tower , an iconic monument , one of the few things that come first in my mind when i think of paris .",1
visiting it for the first time i expected and experienced nothing less .,1
excellent views from the top and you can buy a glass of champagne there .,1
"the entrance is a little confusing , but once you 're in line , you figure it out .",1
it is the best place to see all paris .,1
definitely recommend sitting on the lawns in front with a bottle of wine while it sparkles for a date,1
time required for tickets takes around 1.5 / 2 hrs .,1
we learnt the history through the guide and were awestruck by its beauty .,1
there are plenty of places for pictures .,1
"the staff were brilliant they took olivia to the lift , avoiding the queue .",1
it is the most beautiful places in the world so far that i have been to .,1
tickets are released 2 months prior and if you want to go up to it i recommend you keep looking at the site 2 months in advance closer to the date .,1
"eiffel tower is an international monument , known by everyone .",1
ya you should get up there at least once tho .,1
the view is amazing and they had a skating rink on second level which was really awesome .,1
what more can be said about this tower ?,1
"whether you are under it , next to it or looking at it from a distance , the experience is amazing .",1
she s a feminine tower that is worldwide famous .,1
at first i am not really excited about seeing this .,1
no word to explain her beauty .,1
should see this both in the daytime & nighttime .,1
must see masterpiece .,1
do n't miss the ` twinkle ' show in the evening -- unforgettable !,1
"i might not have taken the time to visit the eiffel tower again , except it was my husband 's first visit to paris .",1
each level is nice and clean .,1
it 's a must while in paris !,1
"large ugly chain fences , cement barriers , portable buildings and just unsightly .",1
it is better to buy your tickets before you visit the tower .,1
i loved the design and construction .,1
what can i say that has n't already been said ?,1
"strange , the eiffel tower is such an attraction that it is better to cross the siene and get a better look at the tower -lrb- amazing at night -rrb- rather than putting yourself through the pain of going up the tower itself .",1
"went to the top , took the infamous selfies and off we went .",1
it was well worth the climb .,1
"it may be expensive , but it 's a world-class landmark and is well worth it .",1
this level was the least crowded and they have a few exhibits about the attraction itself .,1
"lots of people selling trinkets in the area , be very firm if you do n't want anything or they may get annoying",1
there is now a security check to get underneath the tower now and you should prepare a lot of time if you want to visit the top .,1
both times i queued for tickets and i think the experience is worth it .,1
a little rainy but not bad .,1
we got a tour and the lines were minimal in mid september .,1
the lines are long to get in .,1
"but the problem only to many people sold accesories around the effiel , i fell unsecure with this the people .",1
excellent view of the entire city .,1
one should visit once during the day and one more time after dark or during sunset to fully appreciate the view,1
false money going around !,1
an absolute `` bucket list '' item !!,1
we went around 9pm and purchased tickets to go up to the 2nd floor .,1
its the staple landmark of france .,1
"must do in life , have to do while in paris ... this was our second time around and it never gets old .",1
"went twice ... never made it up the tower , but had a nice evening both nights visiting and doing a little shopping and having snacks near the tower .",1
while we are up on the tower going to the summit and having the time of our lifes our friends walked out of the security area towards the louvre and while they walked the treed area they were suddenly drenched in what they thought was bird dodo !,1
we saw it from trocadero and did walk to the bridge to get a closer view of it as well .,1
you can very much see the eiffel tower from most places in paris .,1
"we got a guided tour , and went at night .",1
we ate dinner looking at the tower lit up and sparkling !,1
"we met at the archeological museum at the palais de chaillot to walk through the trocadéro with perhaps the best view of the eiffel tower on our way to the boat dock all the while listening to our guide , dennis , relate the history of the tower .",1
not ideal .,1
my only surprise about this place was the overload of persistent keyring illegal street vendors that constantly ask you to purchase their mini eiffel tower souvenirs .,1
weather was not too good and it started to rain so did n't plan on going up the tower .,1
great fun for the kids .,1
i try to look for it wherever i am in paris .,1
it was one of the ticks one has to put on the life-list boxes .,1
both times were nice but i have a few tips to make you life a little better .,1
we booked our eiffel experience through a tour group simply to avoid all the lines abd glad we did .,1
"the view from the top is simply spectacular so is to have a glass of champagne , expensive but goes with the view .",1
add to that is euro cup 2016 and the french authorities are even more on edge .,1
non tower ticket holders like us could n't get to wander round the gardens and the base of the tower because it was sealed off with railings to allow a -rrb- tower visitors not to have to mix with football fans and b -rrb- for the police / security to allow fans into the fan zone to watch the football on the big screen via security checks in a controlled manner .,1
this is the best place to view paris from the top .,1
i would recommend spending the extra few euros and purchase a skip the line tour .,1
"if you showed up during the middle of the day without skip the line tickets , you 'd be waiting for several hours to get in .",1
"if the lines are n't 3-4 hours long , i would definitely recommend going to the top .",1
walked up the entire length except the last stage where they do not allow walking .,1
it was just at dusk when we were at the top - spectacular view - all lit up - a must do in paris .,1
"do n't worry your not missing much , just a lot of building tops that look the exact same .",1
it is a cheaper entry fee and much smaller lines when climbing the tower .,1
the tour guide was very knowledgable and spoke very good english .,1
do n't miss it !!!,1
"we were wet , cold when we reached the second level , but it was worth it : to know that you are in this famous building is phenomenal .",1
"to get a clear pic of the tower , there is a park on one side and the troc adeno across from the tower on the other .",1
"well , without doubt eiffel tower is a must visit attraction and when you visit that , pls do not miss going on the top and view paris .",1
"one would suppose that in an april friday there would be a lot of people , but this was terrible .",1
can go by ladders also .,1
"visited the second floor , great view over paris .",1
i hope all the travellers enjoy the view of the tower at day and night time .,1
it is better to book a entry ticket in advance if you know when you want to visit .,1
"on the top , you can enjoy a glass of champagne and enjoy the view .",1
take the 69 bus and it will give you quick a nice inexpensive tour of paris,1
best photo ops from the champs de mars or on the pont d'lena bridge.,1
been there last year .,1
"the queu took about 15 minutes , the prices are not high .",1
"sadly , they take away from the experience and make it feel a little seedy .",1
by the time we got down -lrb- around 11am -rrb- the lineups were infuriatingly long .,1
"undoubtedly , there are many other taller building in the world , but it is the eiffel tower !",1
every trip to paris requires a pilgrimage to this iconic site .,1
one of most memorable sites in visit in france .,1
probably much nicer in summer !,1
"if you do n't buy your tickets beforehand , be prepared for a lengthy wait .",1
"after seeing it on tv , in the media etc growing up ; its always been one of the iconic symbols of paris .",1
all you have heard is true .,1
there was long que as it was summer time and lot of visitors were there .,1
the eiffel tower is a magnificent tourist attraction .,1
"in every aspect , the structure , location , gardens , crowds , once you ' be walked under the massive accomplishment of the industrial revolution and awe 'd at the crowds .",1
i strongly recommend to have that expensive glass of champagne on the top .,1
if you have time and strength in your feet you may try to climb 1 / 2 or all 3 levels .,1
we decided a day view over a night view would be fun .,1
"absolutely loved the eiffel tower , no pics nor words can describe the experience .",1
visited here a while back and was blown away .,1
so it 's better to go up when it 's warm .,1
"climb the eiffel tower for a beautiful climb the eiffel tower before sunset experience , to enjoy the views day and evening before sunset after sunset",1
be sure to see the magnificent tower when it is outlined with thousands of sparkling lights on the hour .,1
"and of course it is a must do event that does not disappoint , even when it 's cool and windy outside .",1
the elevator was crammed way too tightly for my comfort .,1
"crowds were manageable , allowing room to look and stroll around perimeter .",1
a couple of us went by the stairs and there was probably a five minute wait to buy the ticket .,1
"my second time visiting , first time with kids .",1
for me this is a must visit every time we are in paris .,1
the lights are simply gorgeous !,1
"we still had to wait in line to get up to the top , but it was n't that long .",1
fairly annoying .,1
this place is gorgeous and a must to see when in paris .,1
the tower sparkles late at night and it was spectacular !,1
"while very expensive , it was good and we did n't have to wait forever in the ticket line .",1
the eiffel tower is an absolute must visit attraction in paris .,1
inside and out take it all in .,1
"btw , they have now completed the glass floor , and all the building scaffolding has been removed .",1
get your tickets to the eiffel tower well in advance -lrb- months . -rrb-,1
a must seen place .,1
we visited france for 14 days in june of 2016 .,1
we barely waited .,1
the flickering lights at night are magical .,1
maybe it 's because i detest tourist traps .,1
"just as expected , eiffel tower is a must for paris .",1
do n't underestimate how quickly this lady sells out !,1
there are no words and on the hour every hour at night it glitters for five mins .,1
"if you go at the height of tourist season , get the skip the line pass , lines can be long .",1
went online every day and snagged tix a day before we left .,1
and it is all worth it !!,1
"the eiffel tower is so iconographic -lrb- and used as a backdrop in every movie shot in paris -rrb- , that it might seem anti-climactic to stand before it .",1
i will recommend ari as the photographer for the job .,1
seeing the tower in person was worth the price of my airline ticket .,1
also the queues are so long at any given point that it takes away the romance out of the window .,1
we took a fast past tour with a guide and it s a fascinating history .,1
unforgettable experience .,1
"there are three visitor platforms accessible by steps or a lift , all offering open air vistas across the city and river .",1
it is so fun and the view of paris is amazing !!,1
"from far it might seem nice , but from the bottom is so ugly .",1
i would highly recommend buying tickets in advance .,1
"a must see when visiting paris , amazing structure .",1
we purchased a package and did n't have to wait in line and it included lunch in the eiffel tower restaurant .,1
"we were a large group and we reserved a guided tour with skip the line tickets , definitely worth it .",1
i went there in the day and at night .,1
good that we feel safe when visiting .,1
the eiffel tower looks quite simply like a big electric pole during the day but completely transforms into one of the most beautiful things you 'll see at night .,1
if this was run by americans they 'd have the whole thing much more smoothly run .,1
great timing .,1
the panoramic view over the extraordinary city is amazing !,1
we visited late afternoon and stayed until dark to see the city light up .,1
do it when the weather is nice only .,1
"i would recommend packing light , we had luggage with us and due to security checks it slowed us down , but is understandable that they had to do this .",1
really enjoyed the visit to the eiffel tower .,1
the lights at night are nice of the tower .,1
we took an additional day tour to the tower and went up to second level .,1
the view from the arch de triomphe is just as spectacular and way less crowded .,1
we were visiting in mid october so the crowds were not overly huge .,1
the lights sparkle at night which i think is pretty but i know the local parisian residents dislike it and i can honestly get why that do .,1
be sure not to miss the light show on the hour every night .,1
so glad we did the eiffel tower !!!,1
it was worth the money to get such impressive views .,1
"if possible , purchase your time/tickets online !",1
you can see 360 degree view of paris and surrounding area .,1
"a must visit in paris , one of the most hunted atractions in town .",1
avoid weekends and mondays if you can .,1
visiting to eiffel tower was such a beautiful amazing evening ever in paris .,1
"i 'd pre booked a visit to the summit of the eiffel tower and travelling there was so easy , the train from disney to charles de gaulle and then metro line 6 getting off at trocadero so we could enjoy the view before a short walk to the tower .",1
"paris is n't new york , and it does n't have much to see from up high .",1
great view of the city from the top .,1
super fun especially with children and stop on the 1st level for the glass floor overlooks .,1
they go quick apparently !,1
arrived a little late but was still allowed in .,1
no queue at all - walked straight in .,1
when planning a trip to paris for my family i wanted to include a balance of historical sites and some fun popular landmarks .,1
go to the summit !,1
there was lots to do on the bigger lower level such as information boards about the building of the tower and a cinema room with a free short movie about the tower .,1
accessible bathrooms on mid level .,1
brilliant by day and night .,1
paris looks so beautiful and you can see for miles .,1
one problem they need to sort is the large number of unofficial sellers of eiffel tower ornaments and such like who stand outside the fence and there are a lot .,1
being afraid of heights was no big deal also .,1
you must see during the day and night !,1
easily visible from various places around city and can be visited any time during the day .,1
"visited the eiffel tower with my partner , and what a memorable experience this was , unforgettable , the view was epic , amazing , just left us speechless !!!",1
we paid $ 13 to climb lots of stairs and have a nice view before taking the lift to the top .,1
"last time while i visited eiffle tower , two piller was not working and very very crowd .",1
the flickering of lights at every hour is amazing sight .,1
bit too crowded in the tower - the lift from the 2nd floor to the very top had a massive line and it was packed with people up the top .,1
it is about $ 100/adult but well worth it !,1
it does n't sound as bad as you may think .,1
we took the last cruise of the day and could really enjoy the beautifully lit up monuments and bridges all through .,1
i so enjoyed my trip to the eiffel tower .,1
"if you can , return at 10pm for the light show .",1
i enjoyed the lighting that they play around the tower .,1
"fabulous structure , fantastic engineering .",1
it 's amazing and compares to the impressive impact on the skyline like the coliseum in rome does .,1
but unfortunately it was way too crowded to enjoy it .,1
"there are a number of different queues to choose from , the fastest being the one where you have booked tickets online .",1
be watchfull .,1
we were staying a quick walk from the tower so we were able to enjoy the lights until the early hours .,1
"one of the best spectacles of paris , the eiffel tower , is one of my favourite monuments .",1
we heard to skip the top and do n't regret it .,1
we took a walk to the tower on our first evening in paris .,1
so go online and pay for a local guide to skip the line - not a tour just skip the line .,1
be extra careful when you see a young group of male and female approaching you and if they should try to talk to you in english or other languages .,1
so great but i can not walk down anywhere after all .,1
we took a taxi there and we walked back .,1
beautiful in the evening .,1
it s worth visiting and seeing the marvels beauty and experience the height .,1
they had a small ice skating rink on the first level which was great !!,1
for our november visit the weather was very mild .,1
it also looks very nice at night with the lights on .,1
of course you must go to the eiffel tower when you come to paris .,1
i had been to the eiffel tower about 16 years ago .,1
we wee due for a tour but it was during the trouble in november so cancelled the tour .,1
there is a glass floor at the first level which is not for the faint hearted .,1
the eiffel tower is the thing that identifies paris to the rest of the world .,1
nice view from the arc de triomphe which allows for great selfies !,1
it also add so much charm to the city as it is visible all around paris .,1
"there are 4 sections , we went on the south side where we walked up the steps : there are 360 steps to level 1 and 360 steps to level 2 ; that 's as high as you can go .",1
forget the `` overrated '' comments - it is the eiffel tower we 're talking about .,1
enjoy this landmark from a distance unless you feel the need to ride to the top .,1
go in the evening after sunset when the lighting happens every hour .,1
last went here 25 years ago and it was n't nearly so busy .,1
"great views , worth it .",1
this is an absolute must when in paris .,1
loved our dy vist for photos as well,1
well worth a visit and of course something that is a must-do if you are visiting paris .,1
"the eiffel tower is spectacular every first five minutes of evening hours , when the tower is flashing and thousands of lights delivers true emotions .",1
of course any trip to paris would be incomplete without a visit to the iconic eiffel tower .,1
busy .,1
tickets go in seconds .,1
"it is still beautiful viewing it from ground level , no idea why the parisian were known to hate it .",1
such an impressive structure and great activity for kids and adults,1
"when you reach the first pit stop , you can see paris in the daylight .",1
it was not that long a line even the end of summer .,1
its worth to see it !!!,1
"we climbed down from the second floor , and could see many people climbing up , but most of them were huffing and puffing , and clearly were wishing they had taken the elevators .",1
majestic at night !,1
well worth it - best to book your tickets on line to avoid the very long queues and/or book for tour & restaurant meal views of paris fabulous,1
this queue was about 45minutes .,1
"it is an outstanding construction , the view of paris is wonderful whether you visiting eiffel during day either during night .",1
or maybe it 's because the eiffel tower really is awful .,1
beautiful picture shoot from the musem across from eiffel tower,1
"inside is cheaper , do n't ask me why ... french !",1
not as tall as i thought but never the less it was absolutely beautiful .,1
"in a way i hated to want to visit the top of the tower as it is waaayyy touristy , but on the other hand , it was something i thought i should experience .",1
the other half had more sense !!,1
definitely book tickets in advance to avoid the long lines + extra long now with their increased security .,1
many great restaurants in the area close to the eiffel .,1
after all it 's eiffel !,1
there is a lot of interesting information and displays on the first level .,1
a champagne bar at the top makes for an indulgent experience .,1
it is lovely during the day and an incredible array of light at night .,1
"excellent tour guide , very knowledgeable , good fast entry to the tower .",1
no need to explain this view myself .,1
nice and beautiful place for visit .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see attraction in paris !,1
that is very pretty .,1
"thrus the staurs is even better , taking time to arrive on the top .",1
we got to the top after stopping at a mid level area for photos .,1
the eiffel tower never seizes to leave one awestruck and spellbound .,1
you wo n't be disappointed at all .,1
"of course if you get to paris you must visit the tour eiffel , but once you see it you might get disappointed as i did .",1
we visited paris to see one of the wonders of the world .,1
the architecture is amazing .,1
there are garden areas to sit and rest nearby .,1
"eiffel tower always has it charm , even in november with rainy day , it still romantic to see .",1
"be wary of the lift , the battery , and enjoy the view !",1
"look out for the lines at the ticket counter , it can be really long on a peak season .",1
so gorgeous at night !,1
we drank champagne and had cheese as the sun went down .,1
"this way , it was agitating at times .",1
"then tackle the last 300 odd steps to level 2 , and enjoy the view and catch the lift to the top .",1
the elevator was massive and there were only about 10/12 people in it which was great as i live in a rural area and do not like to have my personal space invaded !,1
"the waiting lines for the elevators look long , but go down pretty quickly .",1
it will reduce your transportation fee .,1
you can not go to paris without going to one of the most prominent landmarks .,1
great light show on the hour for five mins .,1
walk across the seine and take a selfie with the eiffel tower in the background .,1
this is a landmark of paris .,1
it sucks up a lot of time and the real thrill is watching the light show at night from the grounds in front of the tower .,1
"you may think it is trivial to say , but the tour is really beautiful .",1
"if you book it online , you can skip the queue",1
a must-see in paris .,1
brilliant .,1
the views from the top of the tower are amazing !,1
"whilst we did not go up to the summit as we did not wish to wait in the queue for the lift , the views from the 2nd floor were still impressive .",1
can not go to paris without seeing this icon .,1
"if possible , omit the queue for the elevator and take stairs up to level 1 .",1
the elation of seeing the city of paris rise beside you as you climb higher and higher up the tower is incredible .,1
surroundings of the tower is also very well maintained and beautiful .,1
the best time to visit this iconic landmark is in the evenings .,1
still a wait for a ride to the top but immediately could go to the 2nd and 3rd floor .,1
"overcrowded -lrb- long lines to go up -rrb- , uglily fenced off -lrb- i understand the fear of terrorism , but the type of fencing used is just too ugly for such a place -rrb- .",1
i would recommend to prebuy pass the line tickets unless you have a lot of extra time .,1
i was very impressed at the smoothness of the whole operation - lifts held a lot of people and gave an excellent if not a little unnerving ride to the top .,1
it is shoulder-to-shoulder shoving at the summit and the views are only marginally better than the more spacious and less stressful second floor .,1
"due to it 's probably the most visited attraction in paris , it 's always packed -lrb- long queues , especially the ones for the elevator -rrb- .",1
the eiffel tower is a master piece of engineering and it is really nice to visit it during summer .,1
"when ready to return to earth , stop to visit the gift shop or grab a coffee and a croissant at the cafe on the next level down .",1
we just climbed the trucadro steps for a good view and left .,1
but every bit worth it .,1
great views even from mid level .,1
the eiffel tower was fascinating to see !,1
the tower being lit up is amazing !,1
there is elevator service to go up otherwise you can use stairs as well .,1
my sister and i visited the eiffel tower twice .,1
we were both troopers on this day because it was unseasonably cold and once we got up to the second floor we realized there was not way we could get to the summit .,1
wonderful views if your not absolutely terrified of heights haha .,1
"we arrived about 430pm on a thursday and there was not a single person in the queue to climb , although the queue for the lift -lrb- which you had to pre purchase , and is 2-3 times the price -rrb- , was 20 minutes long .",1
"very long línes to go up , always busy .",1
"a must do , do not miss the eiffel tower .",1
stay on alma -lrb- right bank -rrb- and take a few photos when the tower is lit up at night from 9pm .,1
you can view the whole city in a glance .,1
i would also recommend getting there early to avoid ques .,1
"do n't waste your precious time standing in the huge lines , spend the extra money and get a timed entry ticket before you go so you can make the most of your visit .",1
"however , once the sun goes down and the tower is lit up , it looks really imposing .",1
we love the eiffel tower and consider it to be one of the most beautiful structures in the world ... but paris has a problem they need to desperately address .,1
we stayed while the sun went down and the city lit up .,1
we stopped to have our packed lunch on the first floor on a bench in the sun -lrb- not sure we should have done that but nobody stopped us -rrb- .,1
very interesting but also very crowded .,1
we stay right round the corner from the eiffel tower and was able to see it every day in all different type of weather and day .,1
still shorter lines than disneyland in peak time and worth the wait but it would be nice to see some improvements in the ticket logistics .,1
went to eiffel tower in the evening have been before in day .,1
it is literally a love at first sight experience for me .,1
went to the visit the tower more than twice during my trip last winter .,1
"the reward is there : paris lays at your feet , spreading a banquet before you .",1
a must see attraction and did not disappoint .,1
"long queue on a saturday evening , but all worth it for the superb view .",1
you only live once !,1
we had decided to walk up the stairs .,1
however we went at a time where it was not a busy peak period for tourism .,1
we booked tickets before we travelled which meant that we did n't have to queue as long as some people .,1
"wanted to take the stairs , but just completing some type of race and the stairs were closed .",1
"it was magnificent , but the lines to get to the top were really long even two days after christmas .",1
observed the eiffel tower from the park & directly underneath .,1
"it is bigger than i thought and just looks stunning from every angle ！ romantic , beautiful , carefully designed and truly stunning !",1
an iconic must visit again and again while you are in paris .,1
"if it 's your first time you should go up it as well , i prefer it at night time but it 's great on a clear day too .",1
we visited the eiffel tower on a wednesday afternoon after booking tickets on-line .,1
"it 's an iconic structure , built by the man who built the interior structure of the statue of liberty - look out for the mini-liberty on one of the seine bridges , given by the people of the us to france .",1
the et is alight with colour and shining lights .,1
but we enjoyed it from street level and on a night tour .,1
"it took 3 tries to go up the eiffel tower : first time the line was too long mid-morning , second time the top was in the clouds , also i arrived around 8 am and it does n't open until 9 am ; the third time i arrived shortly after 9 am and took the stairs , the shortest waiting line .",1
i feel the best time to visit this place is couple of hours before closing .,1
try to avoid it on foggy days but it 's great in winter for the little ice rink on the first floor .,1
visited at around noon .,1
you will never forget such a view while you are alive .,1
visited paris in 2013 and loved it !,1
"the eiffel tower is a breathtaking experience , any which way you look at it .",1
purchase the tickets on line so you do n't wait in the que .,1
the view was amazing from the top but i did n't visit the summit as my ticket did n't include it .,1
it 's much enough to just have a look from the normal floor not the summit .,1
every hour on the hour they do the sparkles !,1
it can get crowded with tourists and people visiting with children / strollers .,1
i marvelled at the workmanship and creativity exibited by the architect and workers to create something new with the resources of that era .,1
a trio of armed guards patrol the grounds - and tower was first of many guarded sites in france .,1
you need to book tickets in advance to climb it .,1
tick it off the bucket list and move on .,1
"it may be a tourist cliche , but it is worth the visit .",1
plan for 2 hours !,1
you can go to level one or go all the way to the top .,1
take the metro to the trocadero stop and get out and view the tower from here - day or night .,1
"beware and read up on paris scams before you visit any tourist spots i.e. petitions to be signed for donations , etc etc. .",1
we got off at the trocadero metro stop and walked to the tower .,1
a must see place and a must climb tower ！ the quere will be very long ， second floor could be climbed from stairs and it is better to see paris than the top,1
no wonder it 's now the most-visited monument in the world .,1
"but if you want to go all the way up , book your tickets in advance .",1
my son loved the dessert .,1
"from the 2nd floor , pay a 6 euro fee to take the lift to the top .",1
it was easy to pick out the main landmarks - a great way to end the day !,1
try to use steps avoiding queue .,1
prebooked tickets need to be booked about a week in advance .,1
"this is a must , even if you have a party member who is not keen on heights !",1
"do n't think , just go .",1
no hustle when we got up the tower .,1
we walked down rather than wait for the elevator - the views walking down were great too .,1
crowds were horrendous .,1
"the queues may be a little long , the gift shop and food is obviously over priced but you do n't have to buy from them .",1
as with most places of historic interest do n't buy refreshments or souvenirs as they are ridiculously overpriced .,1
views are tremendous .,1
now it is the symbol of paris that everyone knows about .,1
"it appears if the summit is too full of people , they close the booth .",1
"it was peak tourist season so a little crowded , but it was worth the effort to get the spectacular view of paris from the second level observation deck .",1
you have to wait in queues and be patient but eiffel tower worth the visit -lrb- try to avoid rush hour -rrb- .,1
if you like crowds and crowds of people and like standing in a cue 's for hours then visit the tower in july .,1
"the top cost 15 $ and it was 9 $ to the 2nd level , here we saw fantastic views of paris and well worth the visit .",1
well ... i guess everyone knows the eiffel tower or has heard of it .,1
"but you have the opportunity to stop at the level , look , use the restroom , catch your breath .",1
if you can reserve it online so you do n't have to wait in line when you 're there .,1
view are amazing and when in paris you must go up in the iconic eiffel tower !,1
"i 've been told not to go to the top , just the second floor .",1
i actually went to paris on a long flight layover in 1999 and did not get to see the eiffel tower !,1
all the 4 sides of the tower afford you with a different vista of the city .,1
tried to go up to the top to find out you had to buy another ticket to go to the top about another 6 euros .,1
"at the top it was obviously mega busy as to be expected but you do get good views all round , more or less as far as the eye can see .",1
pictures do n't do this landmark justice .,1
be prepared to see a military presence in the area and two seperate security stations .,1
no words .,1
what an imposing monument !,1
or in different seasons .,1
"my photos are from the first floor , i have no pictures of the higher levels at night as my phone ran out of storage so i used my boyfriend 's !",1
"we enjoyed the views from the top , had a champagne which was not good quality and expensive .",1
"we went with a child that needed toilet when in the queue , my partner stay in the queue for 45 minutes , when it was his turn , surprisingly the woman did n't want to sell him tickets for the three of us , and we had an argument until a supervisor decided to sell it , but completely ruining the experience with nonsense .",1
"oh , and we saw someone get their backpack stolen .",1
buy your tickets in advance and skip the line .,1
"the tower lit up the sky and then , at one point , it began blinking -lrb- on the hour , i think -rrb- .",1
"easy tog et online tickets , no queue .",1
"just a shame the world we live in has forced this beautiful place to have a wall of security fences , police & soldiers around it .",1
price on the stairs for adult is 7 euro .,1
i suggest purchasing a `` skip the line '' pass or do a group tour .,1
unfortunately we could n't pre book tickets because the tour companies buy up the tickets as soon as they come on line .,1
lovely experience having lunch on the eiffel tower .,1
we purchased our tickets directly from the paris convention and visitors bureau .,1
it is the way to see paris and a highlight of your visit .,1
this is the place that you must visit if you 're travelling to paris .,1
for most the eiffel tower is paris .,1
it s all truly romantic and unforgettable .,1
"i went around october 2015 , with a tour guide that took us to the top of the eiffel tower with a river cruise attached to the package .",1
"once inside this area you are free to walk around , take pictures , etc. , etc. .",1
"it 's exhilarating to see the tower up close , but it 's a crowded place .",1
"and definitely pre book if possible , you save so much time",1
the lines were terribly long but tickets are available to purchase months in advance .,1
we were lucky enough to be staying in a hotel just around the corner - evening walks to the eiffel tower were simply stung and views from the top in the day are fabulous .,1
did not go up to the very top .,1
then walk over to the tower .,1
"unfortunately i did see one couple get conned to hand over 700 euros , but due to the large number of con artist around everyone was scared to say anything ... shame the police are not monitoring this has it spoils this lovely trip .",1
we went at night to the eiffel tower .,1
this was very impressive .,1
it 's the symbol of paris and it 's magnificent .,1
we were at the tower during off season and the lines were cramping once you got your ticket and waited at the elevator .,1
was a bit worried about climbing up with the kids but was quite cheap and easy to climb perfectly safe .,1
"security is very good , but takes some time .",1
"halfway up the steps is level 1 where you can have a short rest , enjoy the view , and grab a drink at the restaurants .",1
"finally , i made it to see this magnificent beauty .",1
the construction method and way for the lift really amazing .,1
"albeit not the top , the 117 meter level offers you great views of the city so do n't be too disappointed at the delay .",1
you can use trem or bus to reach the place .,1
we decided to queue up and get a lift pass where we went to the top .,1
the eiffel tower current state is a big mess .,1
my husband is not a fan of heights but was determined to go to the top .,1
and this is where the glass floor is .,1
it has a magic around it .,1
loved it book in advance if possible saves on waiting times security take a little time too plus no backpacks allowed,1
the tour tickets did not include upper deck eiffel tickets .,1
climbing helps you feel the atmosphere better .,1
especially the light show at night .,1
"considering the hype surrounding the eiffel tower , i was expecting it to be this huge , stunning piece of architecture .",1
i have taken an english school group to paris for the last ten years and the trip to the top is always a highlight of the paris visit .,1
huge crowds walking from metro to tour .,1
try to catch it as the light begins to fade as the view constantly changes .,1
make sure you book your tickets well in advance .,1
do not go if you do n't like heights .,1
it is soooo magical .,1
we were staying right around the corner and the walk over is fun .,1
we regretted it .,1
"famous place to visit , take a ride to the top to get the real experience , very busy place but worth the wait , be careful with buying tours from certain vendors online , you may be safer buying directly at the towers due to meeting location and ...",1
we waited maybe 30 minutes to get inside our first lift .,1
it is more fun that way .,1
"we started to q for the north lift , the q was pretty big .",1
"but , beware of people peddling selfie sticks , trinkets , and other jingling junk .",1
just been here with my wife .,1
service was top notch .,1
it was perfect .,1
"the european cup was under way , so the crowds were larger and security was tighter , but we knew that going in so we were prepared for a little extra chaos .",1
"i have been to paris many times over the years , but always make time to come here : it is a stunning attraction , both for its views over paris , and for the fact that such an amazing building was opened in 1889 .",1
"we were disappointed that the park was closed , leaving the perimeter at the base on three sides the only viewing possibility for the public without incurring fees or weighty meal price tags or expensive lodgings .",1
then a flip of the coin determined whether to stand in a long line for the elevator or the shorter line to take the stairs .,1
and judging by the people you see here i see why .,1
visit paris couple of time but did n't have the chance to get on the top of it .,1
just pay your 7 euros and walk up to second floor and it is really high - see over all paris .,1
"the queue moved faster than expected , although we still waited just over an hour .",1
controlled the crowd as well as could be expected .,1
crowded must plan n provide enough time to enjoy vs rush ; - souvenirs can cost quite alot around this area .,1
amazing views of the whole city .,1
the staff were great the lady to our ticket went away to check the computers and let him in without the actual ticket .,1
do yourself a favor .,1
"i missed the tour , never saw the guide and it was not needed .",1
i have never been a huge `` fan '' of paris but the tower is definitely admirable .,1
so it had to be something to live up to the expectations .,1
"provides amazing pictures , an absolute must see on your paris visit .",1
from the second floor onwards you can take the lift .,1
"the other thing was up there was cold due to the wind , so you might want to wear extra layers or jacket to keep you warm .",1
"i had a lovely day at the eiffel tower , and would highly recommend this attraction .",1
you can see this beauty standing even if you are 10 km away .,1
go to the second floor and the view is still good .,1
-lrb- well you could but you would miss out -rrb- .,1
it is beautiful during the day and even more breath taking at night .,1
queues were constantly moving .,1
"i do recommend going up the eiffel tower - there are a few tour companies that offer skip the line - we did this and it saved so much time , we just had to meet the group at one location and were given our tickets then went to the tower and entered together as a group then we were free to do as we pleased .",1
it is almost impossible but somehow i snagged 2 tickets by being flexible and persistent and it was an unforgettable experience !,1
xxx,1
"plus , there are souvenir shops on that level as well and you can buy the most unique finds !",1
"then we left with disappointment around 5pm , luckily we saw the tower in night time under spotlight which is very beautiful !",1
impossible not being amazed by eiiffel tower .,1
"finally a nice young man who was from iraq , asked if he could help and literally walked us 1/4 of a mile in the train station to the exit we had to take .",1
"came back in the evening and although i did not go inside the buzz around the tower was great , lots of street performers and every hour the tower lights up and looks amazing as it twinkles !",1
50min wait to go up the stairs to the second level .,1
17 $ for a ticket to the top is very reasonable .,1
"every one has to see the tower when visiting paris , i 've never seen so many people with cameras in their hands .",1
the tower is more stunning at night than day time .,1
paris is wonderful.helpful friendly people from our experience .,1
hopefully it would be better in the evening .,1
"a charming area with parks , cafes , bakeries and shops - a great place to explore .",1
i took so many photos i was afraid i 'd forget how i felt to be there .,1
"i never imagined the beauty of eiffel tower till i saw it by my eyes in reality , amazing shining art .",1
its so nice at day and night .,1
"the view from the top , especially at the summit , at night was spectacular .",1
it was quite the romantic experience myself and my wife had anticipated !,1
did n't do the rides up so check out other reviews for that .,1
my only regret is that i did n't take the time to visit the tower at night to see its storied lights .,1
but it was so beautiful at other seasons .,1
it is an extra $ 6 to get to the top but i advise doing it .,1
-lrb- you have the option to climb up to the second floor -rrb- .,1
it 's exciting !,1
thank goodness they saw sense !!,1
short lines and 710 steps .,1
"the views are spectacular , even if you do n't go right to the top .",1
i always passed by the eiffel tower on my many visits to paris but never had the chance to go all the way up .,1
we went before they opened waited in line only to learn that the top was closed do to problems with the elevator .,1
make sure you book online so that you do not have to queue for a long time .,1
being able to see all of paris was amazing i was in awe of its beauty .,1
met in park next to eiffel tower and they led us straight to front of queue .,1
we went to the eiffel tower with a skip the line pass .,1
the eiffel tower is one of the best known monuments in paris and judging by the queues is on everyone 's list !,1
"the views at the top are certainly spectacular , but waiting in line for up to 3 hours with sweaty bodies crammed into small spaces takes away from the magic .",1
please book the visit well in advance as this is the most visited place in europe but anyhow it is still worth it,1
very very crowded .,1
the tower is lit at night .,1
vist the third level and enjoy the best view of paris and how gracefully the river seine crosses the city .,1
it was ok ... be ready to do some physical exertion .,1
it looks beautiful whichever angle one looks at .,1
the staff was very friendly too .,1
"and you see it from all over the city anyway , beckoning you towards it .",1
i have a major fear of heights but accomplished a major goal by climbing the steps to the second level .,1
we were rushed getting there on time and ended up being a little late -lrb- came straight from hotel from metro from bus from airport !! -rrb-,1
one gets a better feel for its grandeur when one walks up the steps as far as possible .,1
"such an amazing experience , we were stayin about ten mins from the eiffel tower by metro , the metro station is right next to the eiffeltower which is great , you step of the metro and walk up the steps and then it 's just in your face when you turn left !!",1
i was awe stuck to see the sight .,1
i like it best from a distance or lit up at night .,1
we went to both 2nd level and top summit on consecutive days .,1
"when going to the eiffel tower take the stairs , saves you a lot of time in the queue .",1
still amazing monument to visit .,1
the glass floor in the first floor is pure fun !,1
glad we went .,1
"reasonably priced , go just as it turns dark and see the sparkling light sequence ... one to take the breath away ...",1
i have been so many times before and still go each time i visit .,1
"took my disabled daughter , who has cerbral palsy and uses a wheelchair , to paris for her 18th birthday .",1
we thought we would n't be able to go to the top because tickets online were sold out .,1
place to be in paris !!,1
traveling to paris without visiting eiffel tower will be a mistake .,1
"many people will poo-poo it , but i recommend a tour .",1
a night visit is totally recomended !,1
there is a security entrance on the park side of the tower that generally has shorter lines .,1
17 euros to go to the summit -lrb- top -rrb- by elevator .,1
"the price is 14,50 if you 're under 25 from 25 on you have to pay 17 $",1
"it is very crowded and there are lines for everything , but it is still worth a visit !",1
it is an over 600 stair journey before you reach the deck where the elevator reaches the first observation deck with its passengers .,1
had some great views and some great pictures too !,1
and take a selfie stick to capture the whole thing !,1
"i was afraid that the eiffel tower would be an overhyped tourist attraction , but i was absolutely wrong .",1
check on the official website at least a few weeks in advance .,1
"packed with tourists , lines are huge so best to buy tickets online .",1
there are some things you do while in paris ... this is on every persons list and worth the visit .,1
"this was my second trip to paris , and perhaps the 10th time to the eiffel tower !",1
by the time we got to the lifts : i was ready to quit ... maybe i dont get the hype .,1
"what an incredible experience - the food was indescribable , the service was impeccable , and sitting inside the tower looking over the city is something we will never forget .",1
top !!,1
the down side is the length of the queues but it is worth the wait,1
after the tour we were left to look around and see the sights .,1
"if you do n't , you 'll regret it once you 're up there .",1
"we only went to the first level because we booked at the restaurant , and they had some kind of run the stairs event and no option to go to next level ...",1
take the elevator up and walk down if you think it 's going to be too difficult for you like we did .,1
"the entry was not expensive , and have access to the top floor you have pay already inside the tower .",1
the whole footprint of the eiffel tower is now fenced off and you have to go through security to even stand underneath it .,1
my favourite time to see the tower is at night .,1
beware of the pick pocket .,1
it 's such an amazing building but the cages and security detracts from the potential/former character of the area .,1
it was a have to activity for our friends .,1
make sure to book online and skip the line for this attraction !,1
"pate , prawns , salmon , mousse , lemon curb etc. .",1
but to see it at night is magical .,1
champagne at the summit to toast my birthday too !,1
a fantastic building !,1
"i had my backpack searched , once inside we had to locate the ticket office .",1
"ensure you book ahead to avoid the crowds , i went to the second level & took the elevator , well worth it .",1
"at night , its glittering light is so romantic .",1
"we used taxis to get to and from the eiffel tower and i would recommend utilizing them , especially if you are leaving late in the evening .",1
we were finished our prior tour early and arrived at 12:00 pm .,1
we went back to the eiffel tower on july 13th in the evening to see if we could get tickets through the walk-up line .,1
at 10 pm the lights ` twinkled ' for the evening 's show -- incredible !!,1
the first floor is a waste of time as it is just shops and restaurants and hardly any viewpoints .,1
we sat on a bench inside and looked up at the tower .,1
buy tickets online a head of time .,1
"its fine i guess , most of paris is locked down due to the terror attacks and there is security checks everywhere , also here , so the entire park is fenced in .",1
avoid long ticket lines and prebiotic with a tour guide .,1
i visited with my wife in january after our marriage .,1
it was well worth the summit ticket for the views from the very top of the tower .,1
it all started with the security staff at the prepaid ticket entrance .,1
go enjoy the view / explore the history !!,1
great place for pictures - had fun taking ones that that made it look like a person was touching top of tower .,1
beautiful and iconic thing to do in paris .,1
"visiting the eiffel tower was amazing , it is truly magnificent !",1
and used the stairs going up to second floor .,1
the quintessential place to visit in paris with a family including an 11 and a 7 year old .,1
we went to the top of the eiffel tower - what a great experience .,1
recommend walking up the stairs - cheaper and better exercise !,1
this is a great icon of paris .,1
"this place is just amazing , it has an aura about it .",1
we skipped the lines and she gave great details as we walked around the observation deck .,1
there you can buy a glass of champagne -lrb- 15 euro per glass -rrb- - which has to be done !,1
bought a hot chocolate and doughnut and enjoyed the sights .,1
i really thought it would be ugly .,1
worth a trip back to view at night though ... the cafe near buy sold the worse overpriced food and drink we had in paris ... so do n't go there hungry !,1
glad i did it with the man i love !,1
the eiffel tower lites up every hour at night for few minutes which is another bonus of being there at night .,1
it was a dream come true for me .,1
loved our visit .,1
fun to see from afar at night,1
i did n't have the chance to go up but it was very nice visit it from the ground too .,1
the eiffel tower light show is a must see when visiting .,1
"we visited at the beginning on march , having pre-booked out tickets in december .",1
be prepared for a long wait in queues and best got at by the metro .,1
"once we were on the second floor though , i could n't get enough of it .",1
unfortunately we were given audios without the earphones .,1
take the stairs so you can take in the whole experience and not be cramped into a lift with others and its cheaper :-rrb- the 3rd floor was good but was too busy and you have to wait in line to go up and come back down so we must preferred the 2nd and 1st floors .,1
the best think to do in france !,1
it might look scary at the beginning but as soon as you get there you wo n't regret it,1
we took the elevator to the top but you can pay a little less to go half-way up if you 'd prefer .,1
yes clearly it 's a great landmark with fantastic views but that 's it .,1
this time the trees had just started to pop and made for some great pics and different views .,1
"we were a little nervous about what type of meals we will be served , but honestly , the names were fancy but the food was simple but yet exquisite .",1
just go !,1
the hot chocolate tastes great !,1
"if you travel to paris , you can not miss eiffel for sure .",1
"worth it though we only spent i 'd say 20 mins outside so about 40mins going up , viewing and down .",1
"its iconic if your in paris you must visit , enjoy the fantastic views , soak up the atmosphere and tick it of your list of things to do !",1
"in the two years i have living in paris , i did not knew you can visit eiffel tower by night .",1
"the feel from the second level is awesome , especially when you are sipping champagne at one of the most exciting place on earth .",1
"this is an amazing man made structure , almost from every district you can see the tower .",1
i had an awesome time .,1
food is `` meh '' - do n't bother .,1
i just want to say the look of the tower in day and night are very different and worth to visit it twice !,1
it is a must visit if you come to paris .,1
"if you can , but ticket in far in advance .",1
he was truly a forward thinking architect .,1
it 's a must go place .,1
it was dreary and i felt none of the romance that i have always heard about .,1
"the show lasts for 5 minutes , it is spectacular !",1
recomend purchase go 2 nd level as has least people and best view .,1
since we did not order tickets in advance we waited about forty minutes to purchase -lrb- not bad i guess -rrb- .,1
"on the top you can buy champagne , obviously for a good price .",1
"the tower provides 360 degree views of the paris skyline , a fabulous way to spend a morning or afternoon .",1
"we ended up having to visit the tower twice on our trip because the first day it was closed due to a strike , which i 've heard is a rarity .",1
it is also cheaper .,1
how can you visit paris without visiting eiffel tower ?,1
my rating would have been 5 if i had got the experience of climbing up/down the stairs .,1
could not go to paris without going up the eiffel tower .,1
we went twice .,1
not ideal to visit if its raining or very windy .,1
"get there early to avoid the que , that goes with most tourist destinations .",1
the elevator to the first and second level is big and can fit a pretty large group .,1
it was a fantastic experience ; not to be missed .,1
"when you go in spring for example , the queue is way shorter , but still long :d have a picnic underneath you won ´ t forget it",1
once inside you are on your own .,1
book the tour that gets you to the front of the line - and learn about the history of the tower - fascinating !!,1
make sure to use bathroom facilities as there are none after the attraction closes down .,1
"it excluded a tour of the louvre , eiffel tower , notre dame and a seine river cruise .",1
to level 2 in the elevator was a quick ride .,1
we did the combined eiffel tower with champagne on the seine as an evening trip .,1
"we paid for tickets to go up the stairs as far as it lets you , then we paid 6 euros each to take the elevator to the top .",1
i 've lost count of how many times i have been to the eiffel tower .,1
queue is a bit disorganised but moves along ok .,1
ca n't come to paris and not go here .,1
"we also went at night and generally imagine this is preferable as the tower lights up every hour , and to be up there when it does with the huge light beams circling overhead adds an element of magic .",1
the view is simply stunning .,1
this is one thing all tourist must do once .,1
a beautiful evening spent with wife .,1
eiffeltower is an architectural beauty and a must see/go in paris .,1
"however you want to see it , on foot , under , from the other side , day , night .",1
quite a few photo ops all around .,1
"there 's a few souvenir shops around , and a carousel for you to ride -lrb- if you like to let the child inside you out -rrb- .",1
a tip i learned at the top - buy your tickets online .,1
"we arrived early on sunday morning , some queuing for the lifts but we opted to climb the stairs and went straight in .",1
you can have lunch/dinner at 58 tour eiffel restaurant .,1
"if you are there , go see it !",1
"the views are amazing , i 'd say you get a similar feel as you do going up blackpool tower so understand the phrase `` this is europe 's equivalent to blackpools tower '' .",1
the first and second level is reached by four angularity moving hydraulic lifts and the four vertical lifts from second to the top gallery .,1
we had lunch in the restaurant then headed on a boat cruise .,1
i would recommend just walking around in the park where the tower is standing and eat a crepe with some strawberrys and nutella .,1
but try going up for dusk as the paris skyline simmers into a dusty violet and as the night sharpens into breton navy and the city of lights likes up to the moniker .,1
it was inexpensive to buy stair climbing tickets as opposed to elevator tickets .,1
the view of paris from the observatory deck was simply magnificent .,1
"$ 17 to go all way to the top in a lift , worth every penny , view of paris is breathtaking .",1
visited the eiffel tower on st patrick 's day night and went to the top .,1
some of the family wanted to go to see the eiffel tower at night .,1
"however , there were lots and lots of people .",1
just go there .,1
"being the iconic place in paris , can not be ignored .",1
"it is a masterpiece of engineering however , i expected more wow factor .",1
"but if you 're like me and this is your xth time in the city , do n't bother standing in the line which took us at least an hour and a half to get our tickets from the only two stalls that were open and the top floor was closed due to the weather and it was so freezing that i regretted every minute of it .",1
i have been to paris in 16th december while employees of the eiffel tower went on strike in order to increase the wages they get .,1
it was brilliant !!,1
"perhaps one of the most known monuments in the world , it still stakes your breath away when you approach it .",1
"during christmas , there is a small market as well opposite eiffel tower which is nice",1
but on getting to the top my battery had died .,1
we decided to have a bite to eat in the restaurant and then proceed to the very top for a view over the city as sun was setting .,1
"quite a lot of hawkers and beggers , not great .",1
if you want a quick inexpensive snack/drink after visiting the tower then head through the gardens bearing left and along avenue joseph bouvard .,1
"we went to the very top summit , which i highly recommend .",1
the driving i 'll leave to the french .,1
this is simply one of the sites you have to visit when you visit paris .,1
take a boat ride on the seine instead -lrb- about 2 hrs -rrb- and enjoy a glass of wine and cheese while seeing a lot more detail of the city .,1
i took my girlfriend here for her 21st birthday and it was stunning the view at the top was unbelievable really shows how beautiful paris is .,1
"and obviously , visit to paris is incomplete without a visit to eiffel tower .",1
we went here first thing to take pictures but did n't go up .,1
boat tour was enjoyable .,1
you then cross the river to the tower .,1
if you want to go up the tower it will give you a beautiful view of paris .,1
breath-taking view from its top floor .,1
let 's face it if you 're in paris you have no choice but to see the eiffel tower .,1
"came here later in the day , the lines were n't as long .",1
our friends paid $ 17 for each pass and spent the same amount of time in the long lines .,1
"no matter how many times i visit paris , going to the top of the eiffel tower is a highlight that is not to be missed .",1
it is absolutely wonderful,1
you see it and it attracts you .,1
no paris trip is complete without this .,1
"at the end of the week , we returned , and this time , the et was open !",1
"my partner thinks they did n't do s great job of it , as they failed to pat down his pockets .",1
the area around was very crowded with people selling souvenirs and trying to get people to play the shell game .,1
make sure you purchase your lift tickets and make restruant reservations before you leave for your trip .,1
nothing that would take your breath away as some natural splendours do,1
so the down side is that your ticket only gets you to the second floor and then you have to line up to buy a ticket to go to the top .,1
the view from the top of the tower is breath taking .,1
the mesmerizing view gets even more better when it drizzles !!,1
it was an amazing view of paris !,1
the big bus stops here and from the quay opposite the river cruises leave .,1
i did n't enjoyed 3rd level as it takes lot of time cuing up for changing lifts and crampy above as place is shorter .,1
great boutique gifts for souvenirs for family and friends .,1
"but do n't miss it if you are in paris - huge crowds , so if you plan on going to the top , purchase your ticket in advance .",1
the view from the top is outstanding and the ` champagne bar ' is basically a hole in the wall that happens to sell the stuff .,1
if you do not get tickets through the internet at the top of this usually can be purchased on the second terrace .,1
you get great views of paris from the summit and the 2nd floor .,1
great views and close up appreciation of the construction .,1
booked a night time visit to the eiffel tower with this company as a last resort as all the advance purchase tickets were sold out .,1
it was rainy and windy when i went but it was ok to see it from a distance .,1
it is a beautiful work of engineering .,1
it 's so familiar it can seem ordinary but it is n't .,1
"-lrb- by the way , there is more than one food outlet on the tower , as well as gift shops -rrb- .",1
"i do n't remember exactly how long it took us to get the top ... though two elevator rides , long wait to change elevators , and a champagne bar at the top :-rrb- all of it was a blur except for the view .",1
the gigantic structure is as magnificent from distance as it is while standing on top of it .,1
"we saw it all a glimmer by night from the seine river , we gazed up its skirt :-rrb- right up the belly to the top .",1
if you order your entrance ticket online you have to be there on time .,1
it is really magical !,1
"i took the stairs to second floor , if ar enjoyed that than the elevator plus he line for that is always super long and just a waste of time .",1
it 's not a very hard job on second floor .,1
"some ppl think it is just a metal tower , but actually you are free to be creative in taking memorable pictures here .",1
"on the good side , the night view is fantastic at the base because of the beautiful lighting , and the view from the tower is amazing !",1
one of my favourite buildings in the whole world !,1
you can almost see it from anywhere !,1
make sure you also try and see it at night as the lights are spectacular .,1
but it must be experienced in person .,1
of course the eiffel tower is one of the must dos in paris .,1
we booked tickets online quite far in advance which i advise you do to avoid the long queues at the base of the tower - with your online ticket you can just jump on ahead in at your selected time !,1
"the only romantic music , or any music you 'll hear is rap or homeless people once in awhile in a metro playing an instrument .",1
we had to almost beg the guard to let us back on at the first level so we could get to the second level .,1
its marvelous .,1
you will understand once you are the time to visit .,1
"invest in rfid protective sleeves for your credit cards , and do n't take any cash with you .",1
the eiffel tower contains 12.000 pieces of metal and 2.5 million rivets approx .,1
"and potentially walk down instead of the lift , was very slow waiting for the one lift to go up and down !",1
we did not take the lift from 2nd floor but what we saw was just awesome and it is highly recommended .,1
nightime is even more wow .,1
make sure to wrap up it gets windy at the top .,1
was in doubt whether it would be safe to visit the tower or not .,1
do it .,1
we went at the end of october about 10pm and there was no que .,1
watch out for your belongings while enjoying the view .,1
the view from the top is magnificent .,1
"if you are able to walk up the eiffel tower rather than taking the lift , then do it !",1
paris would n't be paris without it .,1
"view fantastic , windy and cold as expected at upper levels so dress accordingly .",1
you are then rewarded by a gorgeous view and can treat yourself to ice cream and souvenirs,1
has to visited really in fairness you cant go to paris and not go up the tower .,1
we arrived in paris in the late afternoon - just enough time to check in to our hotel and get to see the eiffel light up for the evening .,1
the light show is on the hour every hour and lasts for 5 minutes .,1
"this is not to scare you , but i saw at least three pickpockets in action .",1
weather was n't great so perhaps influenced .,1
there was a line for tickets for climbing as well as the lift .,1
we booked 8 weeks in advance and were limited to 1 day out of 11 that was available .,1
when we visited it was easy since we already had our tickets .,1
love love love the eiffel tower ... what tourist does n't ?,1
must see at night .,1
"i am not in any kind of great physical shape , and there are landings where you can stop and catch your breath , that 's what i did !",1
"after dark , the tower sparkles with lights for five minutes every hour on the hour .",1
"we booked a skip the line tour of the eiffel tower with musement , because it was not possible to get tickets from the tower 's official website .",1
my wife only asked one vendor how much a selfie stick was and then he followed us and negotiated to lower the price until we agreed to buy it from him .,1
they also ` close ' the top occasionally but be patient as it reopens .,1
"after visiting the eiffel , go for a boat cruise !",1
did not push him to go higher maybe next time .,1
"you have the option to walk up to the middle level , however after that you 're required to take the crammed elevator to get to the very top .",1
it 's hard to believe how big it is especially given when it was built .,1
be there at 9:00 pm and caught the light show .,1
then down in time to see the tower flash on the hour for five mins .,1
getting up is easy enough thanks to the glass sided lifts which themselves give you a whopping view of the surrounding area - this is either brilliant or something to be studiously ignored depending on your nerve .,1
uber security .,1
there are many great spots from which to see the tower - both during the day and evening .,1
surrounding area a bit grotty and little else in area .,1
"by the way if you do walk up , you can also visit the 1st level .",1
really welcoming guide in the office with free wifi and advice on what was/wasn ' t allowed in the tower .,1
"there was increased security but this did n't hinder our visit , were went to the top viewing area and had a clear day a great view and not for the faint hearted",1
i did not travel up to tower .,1
if you are more adventurous and have more endeavor then you would want to take the stairs .,1
even for couple of days it 's a a must seen in the city .,1
be prepared to queue to have your bags checked .,1
loved it and love paris ... big question and only second floor was open so we did n't go up but was worth it to just look up at it .,1
we managed to get up the tower in a clear day .,1
definitely a place to visit once in your lifetime !,1
loved the 5 minute light show each hour .,1
the security staff are very rude and make up the rules .,1
"i hesitated doing the most touristy of things while in paris , however i am glad we took the afternoon to visit .",1
a bit crowded place though !,1
i can keep revisiting !,1
"i have been up blackpool tower , the shard and empire state building , so going up the eiffell was not really required .",1
there 's a bathroom at the top of you need it .,1
the tourist items are also far cheaper in the nearby shops .,1
we were with a group so we only went up to the 2nd floor but the view was spectacular .,1
"otherwise , it is a great monument just very touristic as well .",1
i went during the evening as it was starting to get dark and it was cool watching the tower and the city transition from day to night .,1
we did n't get the lift up as the que was over an hour but a must see,1
"even so , it remains a wonder of architecture and you must see it in both day and night .",1
had to wait and que for a while but it does move and well worthwhile doing .,1
while at the top you can see paris in aerial view .,1
huge monument .,1
my daughter and i had very little time but the lines went quite quickly .,1
well worth it to go up and get the views of paris,1
short stair case takes you to top level .,1
we booked a tour allowing us to skip the line and go directly to the elevator for the ride up .,1
also use bus to reach the tower in the fastest time .,1
glass bottom viewing area near the refreshment area .,1
all in all a must visit if visiting paris,1
visited paris with my partner for our anniversary with this spot top of our list .,1
"stood waiting for a ticket for about half an hour with a group of turkish men who spoke good english , amid regular army security patrols .",1
although i thought it would be too hard to climb the stairs -lrb- 700 steps -rrb- after days and days of walking -lrb- 5th week of our european holiday -rrb- i do n't regret it .,1
"we went to paris last week we had a great time but do n't be fooled by expectations ,",1
"while in family , we were asked to split to go in the elevator , and we we tried to explain that we 're in family and there is enough space , the guy said he 'd call the security to put us out , all this in front of my 3y daughter that had difficulty understanding why the monsieur is 'm échant ' with papa .",1
it took about one hour to get the ticket and go upto the second floor .,1
he was fun and our entire group seemed to really enjoy the experience .,1
took me 3 hours in line even though i had pre book tickets .,1
the people that helped were well dressed and very nice to help our friends to clean the mess off their backs ... after the oriental couple left our friends discovered that they had been pick pocketed .,1
it was much cheaper than booking through viator etc. .,1
"my friend and i were fortunate to have booked a tour of the tower , which was informative and fun .",1
we visited the eiffel tower on a hot day .,1
took the kids here for their first time using a private group tour .,1
a bit chilly due to the morning due but it quickly warmed up a bit when the sun came out .,1
it 's worth see by day and at night .,1
it is well worth spending the extra money to take the skip the line tour .,1
it 's annoying but just ignore them and enjoy the view .,1
so many drunk people -lrb- like help your buddy stay on his feet kinda drink -rrb- .,1
we got lucky after a uefa 2016 soccer match with no line and only waited 10 minutes to get to the top .,1
we booked for 5 and got there at 4.30 .,1
although the weather was not great during my visit but that did n't stop me going to eiffel tower .,1
i was in transit and had very less time so i couldnt go up the tower as i had stand line for hours to get the tickets .,1
a magical moment .,1
we should have done this sooner .,1
be prepared to wait in long lines outside and to go to the second floor and ultimately the top floor .,1
but the views from the top are breathtaking .,1
"reading about it , seeing pictures of it , just does n't do it justice .",1
it 's is important for every traveler to have at lest on picture with this tower :-rrb- when visit paris .,1
if you are in paris you have to see the eiffel tower at night .,1
"well , the view is definitely must see .",1
"we visited at night this time , and by far my favorite !",1
one day i would like to climb to the 2nd level of the eiffel tower !,1
we loved our visit to this iconic landmark and it did not dissapoint !,1
on the way down we stopped to have lunch in the restaurant .,1
be warned that the crowds are big and congestion in some rooms can occur .,1
spectacular sight when viewed form many differing angles around paris .,1
me and my friends really enjoyed the visit .,1
this is worth the effort if it is busy .,1
lovely to be near and a great atmosphere around it -lrb- watch out for the lucky lucky men -rrb- and a great view from the trocadero .,1
our first try to go up the tower - did n't happen .,1
must make time to see it at night !!,1
day time it was crowded with plenty of peoples .,1
a must if you visit paris for the first time !!,1
"if not , the queue for the ` stairs ' entry moves quickest .",1
seeing the eiffel tower was one on the few things my daughter wanted to do in paris and it did n't disappoint .,1
one must visit eiffel tower twice - one in the day and one in the night .,1
everything was well organised and clearly signposted .,1
going to the louvre if you are in paris is a must see .,1
would visit again .,1
the eiffel tower is a must-see !,1
"to go to the top of the tower and see the entire city was in my to do list , it was an amazing experience and an experience that one would never forget",1
it was very quiet when we went which made getting through security and to the second floor a lot more pleasant than in busier months .,1
"make sure you check via which ` leg ' you enter the eiffel tower , as the services differ .",1
"but it was well worth it for the experience and views , just expect to spend at least half the day at the tower .",1
the shops there offer a large selection of cultural and souvenir items with paris and the eiffel tower as theme .,1
take warm gear as it gets even worse higher up .,1
so worth it !,1
by this time the tour groups and usual tourists have left the place and there is greater chance to wrapping up the visit to top .,1
we were lucky to have a night which treated us to a clear view and not too much wind .,1
the gift shop personnel were most helpful .,1
"if you have issues with height , it 's not good for you .",1
"if you are short of time , go right up by paying euro 17 .",1
"fantastic view , its a great walk around it or you can take the stairs up as far as you can and feel the happy burn of ...",1
"we were taken the roof of the restaurant , just our group of 12 , so we did have a slightly higher view with no crowds .",1
"not much to look at during the day but when lit up at night , it is a beautiful sight , especially with the twinkling lights .",1
"we have been there on a working day , in the morning , and the place was not busy at all .",1
just was n't what i hoped for .,1
much bigger then i expected and prettier to my surprise.it 's a must see in paris off course ... but it was very windy around the tower and it was a sunny day ...,1
i booked fast track tickets at $ 15 each to go up the tower on our last evening and would recommend doing this as the queues did look very long .,1
there are places to sit and souvenir shops on each level .,1
i had gone with a package tour and our ticket was up to the top - the `` sommet '' .,1
it 's stunning from the ground and the view from the top is the same .,1
its easier to start from trocadero -lrb- upstairs -rrb- and walk you way down to champ de mars which is the garden in front of eiffel tower,1
the view was amazing !,1
"we went across the street and took some really nice pictures , as the `` grassy '' area was more like mud and not much grass to sit on .",1
"going in the evening , one can see the lights of paris .",1
went up to the second floor at 11.30 pm on a saturday night - surreal and breathtaking views .,1
"so you 'd think with today 's advances with line/cue engineering , an attraction of this magnitude would have figured it out by now !",1
it was very crowded both times .,1
it was really a good experience .,1
we purchased tickets for an english speaking tour months in advance -lrb- citival i think it was -rrb- which was well worth the price .,1
the food and shops up at the top are overpriced but that 's to be expected .,1
"the queues for tickets were huge , but we just sailed past all the queues straight into a lift and straight up the tower .",1
the difficulty of getting a reserved lift ticket to the 2nd floor to the eiffel tower throught internet discourages us .,1
there 's glass bottom floors where you can look straight down .,1
although you can catch a boat tour nearby .,1
i was finally there .,1
"word to the wise : if it 's foggy at the very top , stick around for a while , the fog might clear !",1
we went to the third level at night and it was beautiful .,1
"while it 's an iconic structure and beautiful to look at , every time we go with friends , we always encounter long long lines making the trip up to the top not possible -lrb- we usually just walk up to the first level in the end ! -rrb-",1
the lines were not bad at all .,1
dont hesitate and got all the way up to the top .,1
"a friend did warn us about visiting at night , though , because of the rodents !",1
the most popular tourist sight in the world visited at night and the structrure is magical when lit up,1
things moved but the old lifts just ca n't keep up with the demand .,1
we visited at night and it was absolutely amazing !,1
in our tour we got to see the eiffel tower at night in a super river boat tour .,1
but it 's a must do .,1
"for meals in the restaurants , reservation is needed far in advance .",1
must do,1
do miss out .,1
must see one .,1
got in line for security check followed by getting in the very short line to walk up to the 2nd level .,1
well my 3rd visit to paris and i was all set to get right to the top of the tower but to my dismay the top was closed for renovations .,1
and 2 spacial view places .,1
one of the best first view of it was when i left in the tower station .,1
we made sure that this is in our itinerary .,1
"still great views , just without the crowds , so all good .",1
we booked through a private company so we did n't have to wait in any lines to gain access .,1
and at the evening the lights were out .,1
definetely must visit place .,1
the top outside gave a view of most of paris and at night all the city lights are switched on giving an amazing view .,1
"loads of security to get through , only to be told it was closed due to a strike .",1
it 's always a pleasure to contemplate paris from the top of the eiffel tower .,1
"tower itself is stunning , but prepare yourself for endless queue to get to the top .",1
i have seen pictures like everyone has if this magnificent structure bit to see it in person was awe inspiring .,1
eiffel tower : everything that you see in the pictures is what you see in reality .,1
2nd level is indeed the best to make out the buildings in paris .,1
"we went there twice , once during night and once during the day ca n't decide what i like better .",1
just beware of the sellers and pickpockets around the area .,1
in november when the skies are clear .,1
need to book in advance for a seat near the window which we did .,1
i have been up before many years ago and did not go up this time as i had not booked in advance - huge queue and another approx .,1
"but to be honest , this is an overrated tourist spot .",1
we rented bikes and cycled round the city and all around the eiffel tower .,1
it 's really worth seeing that way .,1
"to be honest , i did expect much if it , but i likes it a lot .",1
", make sure you wear comfortable shoes -lrb- there is no place to sit -rrb- , and use the facilities before leaving home .",1
"otherwise , you can not buy tickets and wait for someone - you buy the ticket and immediately proceed to the tower .",1
"a must-see , the most popular in all of paris .",1
"but it 's a beautiful architectural piece , very impressive structurally .",1
visit the eiffel tower both during the day and again at night when the tower is completely lit up .,1
bring a hat because it is windy and cool at the top .,1
there is just something so magical about seeing the eiffel tower in person .,1
"everywhere i turn , it 's smell of urine .",1
we overpaid for an english tour that was pretty lame -lrb- from cultival tours . -rrb-,1
and we did .,1
everything i imagined it to be .,1
the top level was not available to us so book early .,1
but that 's tourism for you .,1
me and my partner went there as soon as we arrived .,1
"a day out from disney , jumped on a train and took my 8 year old daughter to paris .",1
from there you can walk to the second level -lrb- which is what my family did -rrb- or catch a lift to the third level .,1
although we sadly never managed to go up it due to long cues .,1
so height and amazing view up from the top .,1
a lot of security gates and guards to go through but once through you can buy a ticket .,1
"after dark , on the hour , the lights on the tower `` twinkle '' !",1
champagne available for purchase once you reach the summit .,1
my second visit with my son was even more exciting .,1
once finished we went to the next floor up and caught the lift to the highest level .,1
a must visit when we were in paris .,1
"the tower itself is beautiful , but the place as attraction is awful - full of tourists , long queues , a lot of beggars and fraudsters .",1
"no matter how many times i 've been to the eiffel tower , i just love going there .",1
"the view from the top is amazing , and certainly worth every penny !",1
"we saw it in daylight , in the evening and took the trip to the top .",1
we were there during the eurocup so there was a soccer ball hung from the lower deck of the tower that lit each night .,1
-lrb- i am old enough to remember when you could stand right under the tower . -rrb-,1
some in world famous in many cities taj agra paris eiffel tower there are hotels inso can eat and see the tower and city i had the view in very cold and hot days bot are good,1
it is a truly mind boggling structure and well worth visiting .,1
i was n't going to queue to go up the tower as the queue was ridiculous but we had a great time !,1
do n't forget to bring an umbrella because paris weather is so unpredictable . . . it will be sunny a few hours and pouring buckets of rain in seconds .,1
you need to see it light up during the first 10 minutes of every hour !,1
"we did a little research and wanted to go to the summit , however those tickets were not available for our date .",1
ambiance is great .,1
i go up everytime i visit paris .,1
we 're lightweights i guess .,1
"paris is beautiful , grab a nutella crepe once your back down , there are a number of places to buy them around the tower , but be warned they are addictive .",1
perfect way to spend a few hours relaxing and people watching ... beware of the gypsies trying to rip you off to sign a letter of donation ...,1
visited the tower at night and it was breath taking .,1
going down however is a tedious time consuming process .,1
i was in paris a week and managed to catch a glimpse of the eiffel tower every single day and it put a smile on my face every single time .,1
"advice : try to reach early in the morning before it opens , we avoided the long queue by going an hour earlier than the opening time of around 9.30 am .",1
"therefore , you can not deal it ??",1
wlaked the stairs to 2nd floor -lrb- good excercise -rrb- and then the elevator to the top .,1
i was lucky enough to goto the jules verne restaurant in eiffel tower -lrb- see review -rrb- but if it wasnt for that i would opt to see the grandiosity of the tower from a distance in the comfort of a nice cozy restaurant .,1
it 's perfect to go up on sunny days or in the evening to see the city lights .,1
the light show at night is incomparable !!,1
one of my friends had recommended to visit it during the night .,1
"because we visited in february , there were no lines at the eiffel tower .",1
looks brilliant when it is all lit up at night !,1
it 's very nice to see the whole paris from there but it was way too crowded especially on the sunny day !,1
"better to get the ticket online first , if not you will waste time for a long queue .",1
however it was pretty over rated .,1
the view is good once the city is lit up .,1
lot is written and said abt eiffel tower .,1
bring your camera and some bottled water and it 's much better .,1
"right from the time i laid my glance on to it , my eyes were stuck to the gravity of this majestic tower .",1
the views from the distance are more serene than being in the mass of people lined up to get to the top .,1
the tower is brilliantly lit up and changes from sparkles to blue to yellow to red with the star light at the top .,1
quite efficient security check .,1
i 'm not too fond of heights so it is a bit scary at the very top but worth it for the views !,1
i 'm absolutely terrified of heights and i still managed to go all the way up and get a picture with the views .,1
"we had looked into buying tickets , but the times were all sold out .",1
we went up at night at it was breathtaking .,1
many families were resorting to `` the bushes '' .,1
"for those who are going to be there once , perhaps .",1
"with it all lighted and twinkling.its one of the must see places , just for the beauty it is .",1
the lights twinkle each hour on the hour at night .,1
we did n't venture to the top as it was windy and visitor were n't allowed up so can not comment x,1
we climbed the tower a much shorter line and a cool experience !!,1
it is a unique tower !!,1
we had quite a wait to get to the top but it was worth it .,1
however ensure that when your in the queue it 's the right one .,1
there is a small deli in the tour but it is somewhat pricy but you can take food with you so pack a sandwich .,1
the people who were at security and operating everything are very kind and make the experience amazing,1
we were in the first 20 in the queue .,1
"the tower is imposing to look at from all , over paris and gives an amazing view from the top , or part way as we went .",1
if not in use it got zipped in my bag .,1
did n't go up as did n't feel the need .,1
second time i 've been here and i 'll say its still as wonderful as the first time i saw it .,1
previously i have walked up the leg by the stairs to get a real sense of the space and architecture but on this occasion i queued for the level 2 lift .,1
i think the tower looks better than the view from the top .,1
"eiffel tower is amazing , but the place is so dirty all around that you can not imagine this !!",1
"very very beautiful , so say the least .",1
we took the elevator to the second floor observation deck and walked down .,1
we did a sunset tour which was perfect .,1
beautiful views over paris .,1
"my husband , children , parents and i decided to visit this monument as it was something we heard about and had seen in movies and pictures .",1
we had tickets pre-paid and still faced a relatively small queue compared to the normal lines .,1
"if you go , make sure to also soak up the view of the tower from a few yards away - not just a view from the top of the tower .",1
it is worth keeping on trying .,1
it does look a lot larger in person .,1
the metro station was n't too far away and it was a nice stroll .,1
-lrb- even with prepaid tickets -rrb- people with selfie sticks everywhere underneath .,1
"we planned on going back the next night , but had been traveling for 10 days already and we were tired of fighting the crowds .",1
just wonderful .,1
"you need not go any higher , the views from level 2 are fab .",1
if you 're going to paris you 're obviously going to see the eiffel tower .,1
do you like queues ?,1
this is one of the most beautiful places we have ever been to .,1
it is an absolute must in paris .,1
"in the age of heightened security , there are plans to construct a glass or plexiglass wall around the tower .",1
only a short line to get to the top from the 2nd floor .,1
lights make it even more beautiful !!,1
"pretty inexpensive to go to the top , definitely try to do it at sunset .",1
"so i went through the security line at 9 , and that 's my mistake .",1
"so i waited inside for my family to get thru security , so we can buy tickets together .",1
"the space under the tower is now enclosed with site fencing and you have to queue to enter via a portacabin containing a security check -lrb- god knows why because it would be easy to get whatever inside , either under or over the fence by the loos -rrb- .",1
the tower has strobe lights that illuminate every hour .,1
the third was when we came to the tower itself and went up the observatory deck .,1
went to the summit of the tower using the lift .,1
almost got ripped off by someone collecting money for poor and homeless .,1
"but with 1 1/2 day in paris , i could n't leave it to chance & it was all worth it .",1
i 'd definitely recommend booking online to avoid the queues as it was pretty long when we got there but because we booked in advance we were directed to the fast track door .,1
the tower is amazn and a wonderful experience .,1
we bought tickets for the summit -lrb- you can go to 2 different levels -rrb- .,1
"great views , was def worth it .",1
lots of tourist shops but trip to the summit definitely worth the time .,1
definitely a must see but probably done better with a tour group .,1
"for years you see it in pictures and movies , but to see it up close is breathtaking !",1
let 's face it .,1
enjoyed the visit and commentary .,1
there were so many hawkers around the perimeter fencing .,1
our favorite place to view it from was atop the arc de triomphe .,1
we visited the eiffel tower while on our christmas holiday and all i can is wow !,1
be prepared for long queues so be early .,1
"carl answered , i asked if we could contact the guide , and he said , `` no !",1
1 -rrb- we knew we were late .,1
2 -rrb- immediately yelling at a customer does n't help the situation .,1
the view from each floor was amazing .,1
the views were great from the second floor so we decided to not purchase tickets to the third level .,1
"our admission also included summit access but we were too tired and lines for elevator to summit too long for this journey , but we did enjoy our visit very much .",1
just image well over 100 years old and no city on earth has something quite so iconic .,1
a must do whist in paris .,1
"we chose the lift , it 's a little scary , but the view is totally worth it .",1
got online tickets to get pas the queues and was able to go up the lift without standing in line .,1
"seems like the garden is a mess , the grass is all gone and now when it rains it 's a bit muddy .",1
you can not visit paris and not see this iconic structure .,1
one can not make his visit complete without visiting this tower .,1
"the views are quite spectacular , definitely visit .",1
it was a `` must see '' for me on my trip to paris and it did n't disappoint .,1
after you come out on the top level you still need to climb a short set of stairs to get to the open air views .,1
it surpasses all your expectations .,1
i have heard stories of it taking hours to catch the lift to the 2nd floor then one to the top and then in reverse.we arrived in the queue and it was already down to the walk up pillar but not too long a wait .,1
the view is amazing and the history is incredible but personal safety is a concern .,1
we just walked over to the eiffel tower no tour needed .,1
i was so upset really took a lot away from the tower visit,1
"i am now not myself , i have to become ignorant .",1
the eiffel tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world .,1
the whole excursion took about 3 hours from the time we arrived .,1
"see it at night , i was surprised at how clear it is to see from right at the bottom , pictures are amazing .",1
"we -lrb- family of 5 , including 3 teens -rrb- wanted to be sure we were able to make it up all the way to the top .",1
great views of paris .,1
"many beggars , con artists , sellers of tourists trinkets , so you have to watch your every step .",1
"it is a must see , obviously .",1
we spent a good two hours there .,1
we were in line for an hour to get tickets for the elevator .,1
i was n't prepared to wait that long in the cold !,1
watch out for the street traders .,1
"this attraction is high up - however , i am glad i still took hold of my fears and went all the way up !",1
we got there an hour or two after it opened .,1
buy your tickets in advance !,1
lots of shady people there too ...,1
it is a paris icon - definitely a must see !,1
it was crowded and a disappointment .,1
great trip !,1
great spot to hang out at the restaurant level .,1
it 's well worth waiting until 10pm to watch it sparkle to life .,1
it gives you an awesome view of the tower and great clicks .,1
"because of that combination , the top level was closed .",1
but definitely worth it .,1
ouaaahhh !,1
get there really early to avoid the queue .,1
"there was a proposal while we ate , and the opportunity to go ice-skating on the tower - what more could you want ?!",1
it is so beautiful how it is set up .,1
its magnificent !,1
please be very vigilant .,1
i had not been to the top so i spent $ 17 to go up there .,1
getting down is n't nearly as much of a challenge .,1
"well , we have just returned from our first time in paris .",1
"we were lucky the day we went , as we had n't pre-booked & went on the off chance of being able to go up the lift .",1
first visit was great .,1
"the views of paris are incredible , and my family loved the buildings exhibit on the first level .",1
increadible view from the top .,1
we had dinner at le jules verne in the tower as well .,1
amazing loved every minute !,1
the `` cut the line '' tickets are worth every penny .,1
you have to visit the eiffel tower on your first trip to paris right ?,1
"however , please be wary of pick pockets and beggars as they are everywhere !",1
i was lucky to get a few minutes of blue sky for some photos .,1
what an erector set !,1
it indeed is a landmark or not only paris or france but of whole europe .,1
"this place is remarkable , beautiful and authentic .",1
"however if i had it to do over again , this is the one attraction i 'd skip .",1
"but i would suggest if you are pressed for time , plan a night trip to the eiffel and go to the top .",1
how i wish there are more restaurants up there .,1
i would suggest taking a canal boat as it also goes through the city and past all the sites we saw .,1
was able to explore eiffel tower and look at paris ' cityview from top part .,1
loved to see it ourselves and better at night !,1
we turned up in the early evening to take some photos and were amazed to find almost no queue .,1
the food was excellent and the view outstanding .,1
a huge structure and surround is wonderful .,1
"hard to believe that when the eiffel tower was first exhibited , parisons hated it !",1
its a lot of them selling copies of the tower and selfie sticks .,1
it 's a funny experience .,1
"we had a lunch on 1st level , views were superb .",1
be aware of the people selling stuff though .,1
i was shocked that it did n't make it to the list of the new wonders of the world is simple spectacular this place i loved it i walked to the middle of the tower which is called the second floor you get an awesome view you can also choose to go up the elevator to the top fkr like 5 euros more is am awesome place,1
the building is so amazing when my wife and i reached there .,1
"while it 's an absolute must-do stop on your tour of paris , it 's worth noting that it 's not all roses .",1
the view is so beautiful up there .,1
be there at dusk and view from a distance when the ` christmas ' lights start to come on .,1
"worth going day and night , it does not matter .",1
i would highly recommend buying advanced tickets .,1
make this stop a priority in your travel plans .,1
"given we had dinner reservations we elected not to , but i 'm sure is worth the wait if you do n't want to pay the extra for the restaurant -lrb- which is n't cheap -rrb- .",1
the huge structure just mesmerizes me with its gigantic beauty .,1
"of course , an incredible , iconic structure of paris .",1
"it works as an icon on the skyline , but it 's just plain ugly close up .",1
"we took the lift up , which if like me you are not the best with heights , is recommended .",1
make sure you see the lights the first 10 minutes on the hour -lrb- in the evening -rrb- .,1
then saw the control room for the elevators .,1
too some photos of it and then left .,1
a visit to the eiffel tower is quite easily possible given its central location ; however if you are planning on climbing up make sure you get your tickets in time .,1
avoid those selling friendship bands !,1
we bought our tickets before our visit and only had to wait about 30 minutes before going up .,1
the view from top is worth putting the effort .,1
toured with a group and guide on a clear blue sky weekday afternoon .,1
"one really ca n't go wrong with the eiffel tower , the most symbolic landmark of paris - without doubt .",1
"my sister and i got there at about 11:15 a.m , got in line for the stairs and only waited about 15 minutes if even .",1
anyway we got together to enjoy the views and the sheer beauty of a mecanno type structure .,1
-lrb- i 'm not sure about the ending hour -rrb- .,1
"i now wished , i had gone all the way to the very top !!!",1
went passed on hop on off bus did n't go up when on boat on seine at night see eiffel tower lit up looked gorgeous then during day looks like rust bucket,1
"we went here for valentine 's day it is truly amazing , there were very long queues to go up but well worth it we went right to the top the views were stunning and it sparkles every hour it looks magical loved it",1
"i expected the eiffel tower , to be taller so as you can see its top from all over the city ... but it 's not that tall !",1
well worth the visit with incredible incredible views .,1
fabulous ingenuity and tired kids too !,1
the views of paris from atop the tower were truly stunning .,1
great !!,1
"every morning before the day start take a walk to admire that beautiful creation , with the first lights behind is such a great experience to start a day",1
we did not and had to go through a tour group to get tickets to be able to get to the summit .,1
i was surprised there was no police presence,1
we visited to take photos around this iconic piece of engineering and were saddened to see it now cordoned off by fences and that entry was only allowed if you were actually going up .,1
"we were n't able to go up the eiffel tower because the lines were crazy , however we did n't realize that u could buy tickets in advance and make reservations i would recommend doing that if you can plan it .",1
i would say the night view is better .,1
we came here around 10 pm and went across the street and picked a spot on the grass and waited for it to sparkle and it was beautiful .,1
wanted to visit here for such a long time now i am here and having a very great day and full of memories .,1
"no lines in january in the cold , and no crowds on the observation decks .",1
that gives me a chance to come back .,1
at night time it sparkles on the hour which is quite interesting .,1
each time is like the first time .,1
we were able to go all the way to the top and take a tour inside the tower .,1
you can buy tickets in advance but much cheaper to just wait in the queue if you are not in a rush .,1
the large amount of people who are selling tacky novelty items at the eiffel tower ruined the experience for me .,1
"i love the eiffel tower and visit it every time i visit paris , it is currently cordoned off due to landscaping the gardens.the tower is magnificent in the evening when the lights start to shimmer on the hour after 5.30 pm .",1
shame so many people out in the front selling tack but other than that was a gorgeous view and loved every minute .,1
"lovely to stay at the top as long as we wanted , no hurry to rush down .",1
went to the summit and the views were spectacular .,1
"go early in the morning , queues are not that long .",1
we were very lucky we arrived around lunch time so the line was rather small and fast moving .,1
"i had the opportunity to see the eiffel tower during a clear sunny day from below , from a distance , from seine river , from above in all possible angle .",1
"must take the lift to the top level , had a glass of champagne each up there .",1
"then took lift to , i think 4th level , and took the stairs down .",1
1hr wait on the 2nd stage .,1
we went to the summit but had to queue again for the lift to the top .,1
queues looked longer when we arrived back down .,1
it really takes your breath away .,1
beware the pickpockets and the street vendors trying to sell junk to you - those two things are the only drawbacks .,1
this is having an amazing structure and scenic view .,1
"loved every second being on the eiffel tower , we had lunch on their and it was very nice with a beautiful view to go with it !",1
we arrived about 930am .,1
"we had a good time , fortunately with a tour group as i would n't want to stand in line for a regular ticket .",1
that does n't include the security queue to get in the tower square either .,1
not knowing what to expect -lrb- had only seen in pictures -rrb- it really is a must when visiting the city .,1
i ca n't believe i ca n't recognized paris anymore .,1
they added a new ticket booth on the 2nd floor to go to the top for an additional $ 6 -lrb- they did n't have this before -rrb- .,1
there was a homeless guy sleeping under a tree next to the fence next to the tower .,1
"it is an amazing creation from the masters of engineers , that can never be re-created in future .",1
"deff , recommend to go and snap some photos .",1
more beautiful in person than pictures could ever capture .,1
then you can go straight to a prepaid flag and go directly up .,1
the food stalls around are delicious .,1
we took some great pictures from the trocadero as well as from mid center of the tower the view from the 2nd tier was beautiful .,1
this was still a little overcast but bright .,1
"first level has a bar , room to move , food items , and a see thru portion of floor to look onto the ground below .",1
"however , due to well maintained security system and arrangements we managed to get the tickets quiet easily despite not booking in advance and go to the summit .",1
"as someone who has been both a tourist as well as a resident of paris , i hope my suggestions can help the traveler looking for a smarter way to experience the city of light .",1
its my 3rd time in france but every time i enter it feels like the first time .,1
"you ca n't enter paris without seeing eiffel , the 1000 ft high iron tower !",1
getting there early was definitely worth it .,1
morning or late afternoon -lrb- 5pm -rrb- if it is summer .,1
visiting the eiffel tower is a must for first time visitors to paris .,1
but maybe have id on you just in case you need to get into your country 's embassy .,1
the light show at night is worth seeing and the tower and area itself is very photogenic .,1
", my 7 year old sons reaction to the eiffel tower .",1
we were lucky that we managed to have a night cruise and watch the illumination .,1
queue went down quickly .,1
it was no doubt a pleasure to see the magnificent eiffel tower .,1
"while you are there be sure and check out the extensive photographic collection of famous people who have visited , kings , entertainers and other notables .",1
especially check out eiffel 's apartment .,1
tres bien .,1
"but spending an hour in line to the lift in an endless snake like line , can be very frustrating .",1
i also recommend the stairs over the elevator up to the second floor .,1
we hung out to see it light up at night .,1
we understand part of our group made a big fuss with a lift operator who unlocked and took them up .,1
i felt very secure though .,1
i wanted to go on my wife 's birthday but that option was n't available for advance booking as it was sold out .,1
we began our paris visit with a trip to the eiffel tower .,1
night time views form nearby are also highly recommended .,1
"i recommend either booking in advance -lrb- over a month in advance -rrb- , or if that is not available , i love taking the stairs which you can get on the day of within 15 minutes and walk right up .",1
how can you not like the eiffel tower ?,1
you get beautiful views of the city from the top .,1
"this is the signature of paris , so yes you must visit but do n't get your expectations too high up there .",1
"stunning views from the top , especially at night .",1
"after stating that we would n't bother , so glad we did !!",1
"we took the stairs down from the second level , too .",1
and every bit as amazing as in the movies .,1
the whole experience exceeds expectation .,1
was so excited to see the eiffel tower and it did not disappoint !,1
i 'm sure your personal assistant handles that for you .,1
you have to be at it .,1
"ride a bateau on the seine , head over to the place du mars ... the entire area around the tower will have your eyes popping no matter what direction you face .",1
beautiful from atop the tower .,1
"we obviously went to the tower in the day , but every hour , on the hour , it lights up for a few minutes .",1
very good opportunities for selfies as well .,1
"as eveyone says , amazing views .",1
"we went during the day , but it would be fantastic at night , too !",1
i visited paris recently with my girlfriend and we visited the eiffel tower because we were after all in paris !,1
we really enjoyed it but you definitely need to go all the way to the top - worth the extra euros !,1
the food was delicious .,1
it is totally different at night than the day and both are worth seeing ... .,1
the area is fenced it so it obstructs your pictures but it 's worth the visit !,1
"we went just before sunset and got to watch the sunset from the 2nd level , which was breathtaking .",1
"it 's just the most beautiful , magnificent thing .",1
"we decided even with a little one to climb to the 2nd stage before getting the lfit to top the top , partly for the experience and partly because there was a large queue for the lift at the bottom .",1
it was great seeing it on the tower and under .,1
glad we went in winter we had a guide so quick and easy to gain entrance truly spectacular and an icon .,1
it .,1
take a trip also up the tower and be brave and stand on the glass to look down to the bottom .,1
was a nice couple of hours here .,1
"even doing 3 hours of queue to buy the tickets , 30 minutes to get the elevator to the second floor and another 30 minutes to go from the second to the top floor was worth it .",1
"we visited the eiffel tower in december near christmas , also to see the christmas markets nearby .",1
got there at lunch time on a monday .,1
"get tickets online very early as it runs out fast , or you 'll have to get tickets on location .",1
"i would n't eat here , but on a warner day , i would definitely have a glass of champagne at the top !",1
great destination .,1
"not many people use this option , but you can go to the eiffel tower by boat .",1
buy your tickets in advance .,1
this is obviously a must-see for any visitor to paris .,1
defiantly go up and take in the view .,1
"the environment is amazing , being in the style of a jules verne novel and the food is quite good for the price .",1
there has n't been a single trip to paris where i have n't paid my respects to this incredible landmark .,1
went by boat trip and then as it got dark we saw paris at night .,1
"paris is just stunning , and to have such a lovely view was a gift .",1
they sellout quickly unless you are booking through a guide .,1
an experience worth experiencing again !,1
a must if in paris,1
its iconic shape is seen from many spots around paris .,1
the place is magnificent .,1
it was an overall enjoyable experience .,1
twice each hour it sparkles with even more lights .,1
our pre-purchased ticket -lrb- bought mine on viator -rrb- gets you to the second level .,1
"that is no longer true ; the signs that had previously said biy tix to the top here were covered with black tape , so it is probably a recent change .",1
the views are amazing the food is great .,1
perhaps it was the amount of people jammed into such a tiny space which takes away from the romance and leisurely feel of checking out this great city .,1
lovely view .,1
with our tour we bypassed all the lines straight to top super easy .,1
this iconic fixture is what paris is all about .,1
i thought the height might be a bit off putting but it was worth the price .,1
i have been here a few times & the queues can be enormous but well worth the wait .,1
try getting tickets online rather to avoid disappointment .,1
i had a woman walk up to me and pretend she found an engagement ring to try to engage me in conversation .,1
"i consider it a must do , but once really would be enough .",1
we went to the second floor and saw the sunset and then the lights come on over paris beautiful.it was pretty cold and a coat was required .,1
"queues are very long especially over easter when we were there , and also holiday period .",1
we bought a skip the line tour through blue fox to go to the summit and it was worth every penny .,1
fantastic views and unbelievable to walk on such an amazing landmark,1
ca n't tell you anything new other than the crowds are enormous and the only way to go is to buy a skip the lines ticket or a tour ticket even then you will be up for at least a twenty minute queue,1
we estimated it would take us several hours waiting .,1
tripadvisor ' reviews helped me make choices about tours and restaurants .,1
"the west leg contains a lift exclusive to those that have booked the restaurant plus the stairs : the queue for the stairs was shorter but there are 780 stairs to the second level , where there 's a ticket office to buy a ticket to the lifts to the top for 6 eur : everyone has to change lifts on level 2 but most will have bought a 17 eur ticket to the top at ground level .",1
certainly worth seeing up close if you 're nearby .,1
magical !!!,1
so prepare accordingly .,1
visiting the eiffel tower when on a visit to paris is a must and i 'm so pleased that despite my fear of heights that we went up as far as they would let us .,1
is there anything else to say ?,1
we took a tour all the way to the top and it was well worth it !,1
the eiffel tower tour included lunch .,1
the eiffel tower is probably one of the best towers weve been up and has the usual shop and bar etc. .,1
lifts to the top were not running because of the weather so a little disappointed .,1
the view from the summit is incredibly an worthwhile going right to the top .,1
the tower itself was lit up beautifully as well and can be seen from miles around .,1
the tour was worth it as we got to skip the line and go right into the tower .,1
one of the men in our group had a swiss army knife and it got taken away and not to be given back so just be careful that you do n't bring anything that you would n't mind getting taken away .,1
"if you go to paris , you have to go to the eiffel tower , simple as that .",1
ensure you see it at night all lit up and wait for the shimmering and magical light display .,1
"a lot of curiosities , relevant and historical information , we had the opportunity to visit some places into the tower usually not accesible by regular visitors .",1
diffent feeling between day time and night time .,1
very disappointed - the tower is very impressive and dominates the area .,1
"if you need to read the reviews , do n't bother to go .",1
i went up to top floor with my 6 old years soon .,1
over crowded viewing area more waiting inline to go to the top another packed lift and an even smaller viewing area with more people because it 's at the top .,1
"a must visit when in paris , escpecially during the illumination which happens every hour until midnight , during nightfall .",1
went at night and was amazing to see the flashing lights and the view of the city !,1
i m not sure ... when you can go to the montparnasse tower where you have no line and better view,1
eiffel tower is a unique building and especially is amazing in nights .,1
you are screened two times on the way to the summit .,1
went here on the day of our 25th wedding anniversary .,1
huge and amazing structure .,1
need to see during the day and night .,1
"rather , it included first floor tickets for lunch at the restaurant .",1
but architecture-wise it is n't something very impressive .,1
quicker to get down by the stairs than wait for the lift .,1
amazing standing there !,1
i was in awe of the tower to which i have only seen in books and on television .,1
not enough can b said abt it .,1
"times have changed with all the additional security measures , however as this is such an iconic structure you can not go to paris without a trip to the top of the eiffel , was it worth it ?",1
naturally a must do and worth going up all the way to the top .,1
next time i am in paris i would like to go at night .,1
any trip to paris would not be complete without a trip up the eiffel tower .,1
for the eiffel tower part we had skip the queue tickets with our guide .,1
it was good to say i have been up there the view is nice on clear days.everthing is overpriced.had to buy a drink before the high-winds cracked up my face into pieces .,1
"i did not know there were restrooms , gift shops and places to get drinks at the first stop .",1
there are many other great views that i prefer to this view from the top .,1
c'est magnifique !,1
a classic that you must see .,1
do n't miss a chance to explore from above .,1
there are steps about 2 blocks away and it 's dead on straight with the tower so you can get great shots !,1
one level has a lovely `` park '' with some yummy snacks .,1
been twice now and it is still exciting and amazing .,1
we came to see this famous place and it was just as beautiful as i expected .,1
we left going the way of the military museum which i believe is on the north side .,1
the tower is lighted at night and five minutes of the hour it '' sparkles '' - beautiful !,1
night is a completely different feel and the city of lights is really viewable .,1
such a shame .,1
but if you are there - you really do need to go to the summit .,1
"have never climbed it , havent felt the need .",1
eiffel tower itself is impressive but the area surrounding it is full of litter .,1
"the tower lit is something else ... you ca n't go up at night , but if you want to view the beauty of the tower then see it at night .",1
a tip ; get skip the line tickets !,1
it was a little nerve wracking going up and would not suggest to those afraid of heights or who are claustrophobic .,1
"saw the tower by day , did n't go up , however it was very beautiful !",1
i might do it again to see it at night but probably not otherwise .,1
truly paradise .,1
when we passed by later in the day the queues were very long,1
we preferred buying our own sandwiches and spending some time on the lush green lawns .,1
while in paris is obligatory to enter the top .,1
absolutely .,1
the tower lit up as we were climbing and was even more beautiful than during the day .,1
"eiffel is charming on daylight , but it gleaming and glistening at night .",1
a must do for anyone visiting paris !!,1
i always used to wonder why people are so attracted to it .,1
there is also an ice rink in the first floor .,1
it was a little crazy getting in and seated but the rest of the evening was a real treat with a 6 course meal .,1
i skipped the lines by walking up and went to the cafe for my $ 15 dollar glass of champagne .,1
it 's great to see such an iconic attraction so close and it is truly awe inspiring as a piece of art .,1
we still managed to have our lunch and get to our bus to the palace of versailles just in time !,1
it was wonderful ride under it at night on a bike .,1
i think because of all the hype i was expecting a lot more .,1
did n't stop us enjoying provisions from the local carrefour on the lawn though ...,1
"visit paris important must coming to eiffel tower , our restaurant not far from eiffel tower and timing still early then just walk 15 min arrived eiffel tower .",1
100 characteres !,1
"you need min 2 hours to see the structure , walk around it .",1
location : exit : metro # 6 & 9 `` trucadero '' or metro # 6 `` champ de mars tour eiffel '' .,1
we elected not to pay for the elevator up to the very top as we were pretty satisfied with our view at the 2nd level .,1
if you stand underneath it and look up you can not help but be mesmerised by it all .,1
"this tower is absolutely amazing , went up by stairs and the view was fantastic !",1
like a vip !!!,1
it 's just amazing .,1
but it was worth once you reach the top .,1
i was n't able to get the tickets in advanced and had to queue up for it .,1
it 's always great to visit the eiffel tower !,1
light show at night is amazing .,1
also if possible take stairs till second floor then one can take lift from there .,1
"you can have hours of discussion about the building itself , but whether you love it of think its not that beautiful , you have to visit this icon in paris .",1
"i must admit , going to the top of the tower was worth doing and i do n't regret walking down the stairs from the second level .",1
eiffel tower sometimes has lines but they go very fast .,1
"however , once inside there were still queues for queues so be prepared !",1
take a look from everywhere .,1
tour the grounds -lrb- even if you 're not one to actually travel up the tower -rrb- and the adjacent champs de mars .,1
excellent views and gives a great feel for where things are in paris .,1
must see if you visit paris .,1
"keep an eye on your handbag / wallet , bring a picnic and enjoy the view : -rrb-",1
try to get tickets in advance to avoid extremely long lines .,1
the views at night were nice seeing the entire city lit up .,1
i ve been there 8 years ago if you go parii this is one of must see but be prepare long queue and wind over all tourist attraction but view was sutting,1
just admiring the beauty from underneath .,1
"that 's great , because i have fear of flying .",1
do n't pass one up unless you are going to a sit in restaurant .,1
i 've been told it starts at 8 pm on the hour .,1
the food looked a little mass produced but actually was very good .,1
it is pricey and the lines can be long but it 's a place that is not to be missed .,1
wine pairing was spot on .,1
"despite a 2 hour que , lots of visitors and a long time on your feet , the eiffel tower is amazing , the construction , the views and the history of this amazing landmark is breathtaking .",1
you can take a break on the first level before continuing up .,1
"but even if you ca n't go up the tower , it 's worth a visit to see it up close and take pictures .",1
"bought tickets to walk up , there was absolutely no line -lrb- in october -rrb- .",1
the shop in the tower had lovely souvenirs and the staff were very friendly .,1
"beautiful as always , its a shame champ du mars is so dirty !",1
then you can either walk down the stairs or again take the lift .,1
"however viator had the reservation and the tour , so we booked it .",1
you 've got to do the eiffel tower if you are visiting paris be my advice would be to take a tour .,1
i was not able to go up to the top but the view from below was just as spectacular for me .,1
"so romantic , even saw a proposal whilst i was up there .",1
"there are panhandlers , gypsies , and peddlers every 10 feet or so that wo n't let you pass without getting in your face pushing their wares from cheesy light up eiffel towers to selfie sticks .",1
"and , skipping the line , on a chilly february day , was a definite plus !",1
"quite a dull day , but the view was still fantastic .",1
wrap up warm in the early spring months you feel the biting winds ...,1
if you were in paris and did n't see or been on eiffel tower you were not in paris .,1
"and when she twinkles at night , breathless .",1
it 's a fun thing to do and you should definately go see the tower since it is the sign of paris : -rrb-,1
there are plenty better views of the city - and less crowded ones - than the view from the tower .,1
the only thing there was an abundance of was nuisance tat souvenir sellers constantly hassling you .,1
worth a look at night with twinkling lights on the hour .,1
the eiffel tower and its architect was so stunning .,1
nice experience on the tower though !,1
"just visited the area , the queue was far too long to go up , but it is marvellous , and there is a light show every night",1
bring selfie stick for pictures .,1
i just wish there are no vendors roaming around selling different souvenir trinkets .,1
"the queue to go up the tower by elevator was not overly long , although we were there early in the day .",1
time it well so you can watch the lights then head up .,1
but i give tour eiffel a 5 because it simply is !,1
a must to see if you have travelled from overseas .,1
we should choose when we want to leave when tired and not have to deal with cranky customers that push us out of the way when we want to go home too .,1
"if you dine at one of the restaurants , you bypass the line",1
i ca n't image after i saw .,1
"what a wonderful feelings when i am writing this review , place is stunning and breathe taking , specially the view from the top of eiffel tower .",1
the eiffel tower is definitely a place that everyone wants to visit .,1
this is a huge tourist attraction so in the area surrounding the tower there are mobs of people .,1
went to the top with pre-purchases tickets .,1
if you need a snack there are vendors in the park if you walk just a bit from the tower .,1
it is worth swinging past at nights well to see the twinkling lights .,1
watch your stuff .,1
they stole their money and the tickets to the big bus that was in our friends money clip .,1
during our visit as a esports team we went for a quick visit to the tower just to do some photos .,1
i went up to the send floor using the lift and it is really recommendable .,1
i traveled on an off season period and just went to the ticket booth .,1
i recommend going there in the evening when the lights are on .,1
all done in red !,1
we went with our young kids and loved the experience .,1
bought ticket for # 5 since i climb it instead of taking the lift and because i was a young person .,1
"the celabration was awesome , with long delivery of lights .",1
it was shinny glitter .,1
situated on the banks of the seine ... the eiffel tower is truly something to behold .,1
football ment the park was fenced off what a shame when no football on .,1
you dont want to be a target of the notoriously famous pick pocketors of paris .,1
it 's something that if you 're in paris you have to see it .,1
"besides the views from the sides , you can look straight down through a section of transparent flooring to put the height in perspective .",1
definitely not me !,1
and that was with pre booked tickets !,1
i 've been to the eiffel tower twice before but never to the top at night .,1
"be prepared for queues and bag searches but once you get up to the top there are great views , a bar , champagne bar and even ice cream !!",1
we were lucky that despite not having tickets in advance we faced no lines and travelled straight to the 2nd floor from where we could have a view of the city but due to foggy atmosphere faced a bit of a problem .,1
a great place to visit at a reasonable price - well worth the extra to go all the way .,1
"we had a lovely trip to the top , but it took nearly an hour to get our tickets and onto the first lift .",1
the glittering lights make it awesome .,1
"very nice view at night , with sparkles of 20000 led bulbs .",1
we waited almost 2 hours in line even though we already had our timed ticket .,1
its excited experience to be at eiffel tower in paris to anybody traveling there .,1
"i would recommend purchasing on-line if you wish to go up , especially if you want to visit the the apex .",1
"it was so easy to book via the net and lock in our time , would really recommend this tour .",1
"so we stood in line to climb up to the 2nd floor and i was crossing my fingers we 'd be able to still somehow get to the top -lrb- we were , but more on that later -rrb- the line to take the elevator up was so terribly long so we waited in the shorter , but still very long line to climb the staircase .",1
they run off every time they see the police coming .,1
such a symbol !,1
"any bus tour will drop you off here , great way to see it all .",1
"we did n't actually go into the tower but went to see it , take photos and walk around and under it .",1
we had a long wait in the cold while the preference was given for tourists coming down from the second level and almost missed our cruise .,1
"the view from top is fantastic , especially at night!it is also perfect to sit in front of eiffel tower with a bottle of good wine and your boyfriend next to you .",1
"on this visit we took the lift rather than walking , which felt quite decadent !",1
"line way quicker , able to take the lift .",1
it is way more impressive than during the day .,1
i like to people watch or eat .,1
"we 've had lunch in la tour many times , both at the top , jules verne , and on the 2nd etage .",1
it was majestic in stature .,1
we did a `` behind the scenes '' tour which was really interesting .,1
"they will ask you to sign a fake donor list , so tell them `` go back to romania '' and you will be ok .",1
to go up you experience very long waiting times .,1
i bought a ticket for a nominal fee to the summit ; you have a choice of entering and going to a lower level or taking a 2nd elevator and going all the way to the summit .,1
"the lunch was about 42 euros each , we were a bit late , but they still sat us .",1
one can see this beautiful tower from almost anywhere in paris .,1
there is always something going on here .,1
do you dare to challenge the summit .,1
the kids loved walking under the tower and being able to look up .,1
i did n't think i would be so astound about seeing the eiffel tower but it is amazing and a must do attraction .,1
the eiffel tower is best seen at night .,1
"very good experience , the views are outstanding and the history of its construction are excellent .",1
the most beautiful views of paris !,1
the light show on the hour is fantastic !,1
i took the opportunity to take one of the elevators up .,1
there are sellers who sell souvenirs on the go nearby and they made us uncomfortable .,1
make sure you wait to see the eiffel after the lights go on .,1
i 'm sure everyone will visit the eiffel .,1
"having said that , going up the thing , even partially is something you should do at least once for a bit of fun and sense of duty .",1
nice enough cafe on the first stage .,1
we came back to paris for our honeymoon and decided to do the same thing again with our new status .,1
i recommend to visit the eiffel tower between the afternoon and the sunset .,1
"a wet saturday afternoon , 1 week after the attacks was probably not the best time to visit .",1
we really enjoyed the meal and experience .,1
my third trip in 2 years and the eiffel tower was a `` must see '' -lrb- again ! -rrb-,1
purchased tickets to the summit ... met at assigned place and taken to tower ... guide led us to second floor after about a 10 minute wait and security check .,1
crowd was less hence got the best photos .,1
since we had already seen europe in winters so we decided to have the feel of summer this time .,1
the tower is only a 10min walk from these stations .,1
"we 've booked a table for lunch at le jules vernes and went after to the convencional eiffel tower visit , directly from the restaurant , avoiding queuing .",1
can enjoy illuminating eiffel tower .,1
"as in many tourist magnets there will be street vendors to sell you all kind of stuff and of course you have to watch out for picketers ' and gypsy 's , young girls and boys bagging professionally there .",1
very few tourists thronged the place which is usually jam packed at any time of the year .,1
one in daylight and one at night .,1
and several individual vendors walking around trying to sell stuff .,1
climbing the 647 -lrb- each step is stenciled -rrb- stairs was like being inside a giant rector set .,1
"easiest to get tix online ahead of time being assured of a date and time , but if it 's bad weather , no refunds .",1
we booked a tour on viator that included a seine river cruise along with a tour of the eiffel tower and it was great !,1
"when i was underneath the tower , it was really touching that we finally were at one of the most visited tour spots in the world !",1
there will be hawkers pestering you to buy souvenirs and selfie sticks -rrb-,1
my ticket could not be refunded .,1
the queues to the different gates get mixed up and create a confusion as there are several tourist groups from different countries waiting at the same time .,1
"trocadero , champ de mars , and ecole militaire completes the magic .",1
"our hotel is 3 minutes walk away from here , what a view it is .",1
"i 'm not sure what i expected , but it was ok .",1
"the group meets a short distance away from the eiffel tower to avoid getting lost amongst all the crowds , you are then loaned an earset through which the tour leader is very loud and clear even though you 're surrounded by hundreds of people , our leader 's name was hannah who had a wonderful upbeat attitude kept all the info very interesting and fun and was akso very helpful , thankyou hannah for making our .",1
"views are amazing ,",1
lovely during the day and ethereal sight at night with the lights on .,1
"as part of a pre booked excursion , we did n't have to que for long and even if we had it would have been worth it .",1
overall a definite worth doing and seeing but expect a lot of company .,1
had a commanding view of paris from all sides .,1
you can sit in the park below and people will come and sell you beer and wine as you watch the light show .,1
if you want to climb on it - get ready to waste a lot of time in entry queue .,1
we visited the eiffel tower as part of a full day tour of paris .,1
its simply beautiful to look at !,1
the ticket infomation was minimal .,1
we went into france on a last minute whim and i am so glad we did .,1
wish i could have seen it at night !,1
"you can go at your own pace so it is very manageable , just wear comfortable shoes and do n't bring anything heavy .",1
"once you climbed to the second level , the views were terrific .",1
"did not use the recommended restaurant but did use the cafeteria which was quite reasonably priced , clean as was the toilet area .",1
we had tickets for the entire structure meaning we could view the very top .,1
it 's bigger than we thought !,1
go back at night and watch the street performers and light show on the tower .,1
highly recommend this trip to others .,1
really beautiful,1
"this was my husband 's first visit to the tower as he has a fear of heights , he made it to the end of first lift and walked around this level and took many photos .",1
the eiffel tower is possibly a bit less impressive in person but clearly it remains a beloved tourist spot because the lines are crazy .,1
everyone should go !,1
"the tickets are not expensive online , especially for the restaurant if you go for the lunch menu .",1
she was very nice .,1
it does feel safer but be mindful of the pickpockets that lurk outside .,1
we got tickets up to the summit 2 months advance .,1
the third floor is said to have a restaurant .,1
very crowded regardless of time of day .,1
so get your tickets ahead of time and read about the eiffel tower on your own .,1
can get a student pass .,1
"if it ´ s cloudy , the only thing you ´ ll be able to see are the clouds .",1
the weather had been really poor all week and visibility issues meant on most days it was n't worth visiting .,1
i 've been to the eiffel tower before and much preferred this most recent visit .,1
definitely must visit .,1
unfortunately we arrived at the eiffel tower when there was low hanging clouds over paris .,1
"when we arrived we did not have to queue and used pre booked entrance , went all the way to second floor have a wonder around took few pictures and decide it to find the way to the top ... well it was a bit difficult because we followed sights and walked in circles trying to find lifts .",1
"you ca n't imagine what a time-saver this is ... and while we had plenty of time ... it was very cold , drizzly and windy every day and mom was fighting a cold as it was ... but the line !",1
choose a clear sunny day to get the best perspectives .,1
"price of $ 15 , - is also not to bad for the view and the elevator .",1
price not to expensive .,1
clear this is the main toerist attraction but it is really overcrowding any view of the steel giant from a close .,1
"however , i recommend considering a private tour to skip the lines .",1
go with a guide or skip the line ticket .,1
"i will say , the eiffel tower at night is one of the most romanic things i have seen in my life .",1
"beware of long lines to buy tickets , to board the elevator , to board the second elevator to the summit , and to descend .",1
the lines to get to the top are huge but worth the wait .,1
"it was incredibly cold , but worth it .",1
"for me , a trip to paris is not complete without visiting the eiffel tower .",1
take pictures with the beautiful city behind you at the top .,1
each night the tower 's lights flash for 5 minutes at the top of the hour - a very cool sight .,1
now the view up here is truly amazing at any time of day but at night the tower sparkles with lights about 10pm in the summer .,1
ca n't wait to go back .,1
did the champagne yes overpriced but one and done .,1
"noticed that there was no line so walked up an bought a ticket to the summit for 17 $ , waited maybe 8 minutes and were at the top of the tower in no time .",1
"it 's literally visited by millions of people every year , and it 's well worth .",1
the first lift takes you up to the first floor and onto the second .,1
the exit route is n't clear but was fun finding it .,1
this time i went in summer and the summit was open .,1
this was my fourth visit to paris yet my first time actually going up the eiffel tower .,1
buy your tickets in advance an let your cash and cards at home .,1
what else can be said ??,1
there is a very thorough bag check - someone in front of us was not allowed to bring in spray deodorant .,1
"big crowds - just take your time , mind your wallet - potential for bad guys .",1
"note that if too many people are a the top they will close entry , you need to wait for some to come down before they allow more up .",1
third level visit overrated .,1
nice place to get yo pictures sorted for social media will suggest reach there just before sunset so you can capture both pictures in the sunlight nice n bright and after sunset you can get you pictures with the lights on of the eiffel tower they have a light show every evening on the hour suggest carry your own bottle of wine as there are street wendors who will sell you wine/beer/champagne all 4-5 times the price however you can bargain but still better to carry your own alcohol to sit in the park in front of the tower n chill by the night with either friends or loved ones cheers hv a lvly tym,1
we did the champagne which is over priced but a must do .,1
and after you 've eaten .,1
we had purchased advanced tickets so good go right to that line .,1
"unfortunately for us , we went right before bastille day and we could n't purchase tickets ahead of time .",1
walking down lets you appreciate the design and construction of the tower .,1
one must see the eiffel tower ~ it would be unfriendly not to go .,1
we find paris in general not that accessible -lrb- the metro is mostly not for example -rrb- but the parisians are very respectful and helpful to the wheelchair user in our group .,1
-lrb- usually about 3 months in advance -rrb- take note that you will not be allowed to bring any sort of water bottles through security .,1
tour guide was very informative .,1
it allows you to go to 2nd level -lrb- just in the middle -rrb- & 3rd level -lrb- on the top -rrb- by spectacular lifts .,1
2nd level is good enough for nice clicks .,1
we were both extremely happy to be on the eiffel tower and did n't let the weather dampen our spirits .,1
my little four year old loved it too,1
i like be the one looking up into the tower .,1
"the moral of the story is that one should reserve as much online ahead of time as possible , then the dreams will last forever .",1
"truly awesome , either by day or night .",1
the price is reasonable and the views are great .,1
they would n't accept `` no thanks . '',1
"it is good to buy tickets online , to skip the lines",1
no doubt .,1
"the menu choices were extensive - four entrees , mains and desserts , wine , and breads - and prepared to perfection .",1
restaurants nearby and taxi ranks,1
sad we did not go up in the tower bit had excellent views all over the city and our hotel room .,1
do n't be put off by the queues .,1
the eiffel tower is one of the most amazing things you can ever see in person .,1
1 more thing ticked off the bucket list .,1
once you are at the top get out and make sure you take in the view !,1
i could n't ' imagine visiting paris without going up the tower .,1
"we only queued for about 15 minutes , and rigorous security , which is much appreciated .",1
the elevator holds about 20 folks and i think at times they max it to 30 .,1
just do n't wear heels if you take the stairs !,1
we were told to take the stairs `` it 's not that bad '' .,1
eiffel tower is a wonderful way to see paris .,1
one of the greatest spot !,1
go at night as the city jus looks beautiful .,1
because of the recent attacks in paris there were no lines and a wonderful time to visit .,1
"when the lights start twinkling , it is well worth every penny !",1
"one can have a key ring , picture or statue but seeing the famous tower in real life is a real good deal .",1
the must see when coming to paris .,1
we believe the best time to go is be up he eiffel tower one hour before sunset .,1
"on a spur of a moment , my spouse and i decided to go up to the summit .",1
"the climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps , as is the walk from the first to the second level .",1
you need to spend some time around it to like the tower otherwise just looks any other tv tower .,1
"i enjoyed a brief visit there with my family in october , mso it was relatively calm for a saturday around 11 .",1
"probably no other single building in the world is equally identified with its place , unless perhaps the kremlin , the colosseum , the white house , or the great wall .",1
"beware of street vendors and asian girls asking you to sign a petition , then demanding money .",1
"when we got up to the upper level suddenly an alarm sounded to evacuate the tower , we were stunned , there where hundreds of people up there with no chance of getting down and they did not open the staircases , so we just had to wait and after a whilke the alarm was cancelled without any explanation , a what to say breathtaking experience ...",1
"if you 've never seen the real eiffel tower , put it on your short list !",1
"with 324m meters high , it took more than two years to finish it , between 1887 and 1889 .",1
we saw the queues at lunchtime from the tour bus and they were mental so we made the effort to walk there in time for 10 the next morning -lrb- it opens at 9:30 i believe -rrb- .,1
it was the best thing we did !,1
the view from the top is just amazing .,1
"watch out for pickpockets and merchants , though .",1
"the queues were n't too long either , on a lovely day we were standing for about 20mins .",1
it 's something everyone has to see .,1
we visited here on the 31st july .,1
they are super slow at removing the stage as well as those gates ... oh gosh ... just a nightmare ... so i was quite disappointed that i did not have a photo of the full tower view ...,1
local public toilets were a disgrace .,1
once opened queued to buy ticket to top for an hour which was a drag !,1
it lights up at 9pm .,1
"by booking in advance , you will save yourself plenty of money , as all the re-sellers on charge the tickets by 3-4 times face value .",1
"we checked online beforehand , as we were visiting over the easter weekend .",1
"all in all , a ` must do ' while you 're in france .",1
"no matter how many photos you have seen , nothing compares to seeing the eiffel tower in person .",1
i did not go up and for me was enough .,1
better chance at the bottom one .,1
wrap up warm !,1
it was pretty chilly in march .,1
nobody will miss eiffel tower when you are in paris .,1
thank you .,1
"most important monument in paris , maybe in the world !!",1
i did not go,1
found it very useful .,1
"indeed , you have to come here once in a lifetime , at least .",1
incredible .,1
no queue for the 680 stair route ... great exercise and rewarding ... if exhausting !,1
"it was a bit windy and rainy the day we went , but we still had a great time .",1
"amazing to see this iconic building which lights up the skyline - worth a visit for view , watch out for unofficial traders and pick pockets",1
the lighting turns on at sunset and the tower sparkles for 5 mins on the hour .,1
we had dinner at the restaurant on our 1st night there and it was amazing .,1
my mother 's first trip out of the us was to paris .,1
our first stop was the eiffel tower .,1
went all the way up and toasted with a champage !,1
which is not bad .,1
"i can only say as much as i can for someone who did n't actually touch it or go on it , climb it etc. but i got very close for the amount of time i had .",1
"you would really regret not going , and have to say the views at the top especially at night time are incredible !",1
"book online to avoid the lines , or pay for the walk up option -lrb- but only if you have good knees and are happy with heights -rrb- .",1
stunning views and was great to see !,1
do n't miss out to make a video of eiffel twinkling every hour for a few minutes .,1
just a little bit of fun .,1
"twinkle lights are on every hour , on the hour .",1
"on a romantic holiday with my boyfriend , i did not expect to be frisked , searched and scanned before finally ascending up the tower itself .",1
"when we went , we were in a ship budget travel so we decide go up by foot , first actually it is more comfortable than we thought it would be , and you can enjoy the view must more .",1
i recommend going to the top .,1
"the view is great if you can actually get to somewhere you can see out , but again good luck .",1
better than i expected !,1
"there is an option for a cheaper ticket just to the first level and then if you decide you want to brave it to the top you can buy a ticket at this first level , so lot 's of options here .",1
its beautiful but the lore to everyone also attracts the worst of society .,1
"this was my second trip to paris and up to the top of the eiffel tower - the security is tight , but worth the minor inconvenience .",1
we went right upto the top level by paying 6 euros per person and children under 4 were free .,1
would n't go back up .,1
"however , the last time i was in paris was 22 years ago for my honeymoon .",1
"not all tickets get you to the top , so ensure you have the ticket you want .",1
the seine river cruise is a nice crash tour,1
enjoyed the view from the arc de triomphe better .,1
after visiting paris for 5 days in august i can honestly say that visiting the eiffel tower at night was worth the walk we had to get to it .,1
"breathtakingly beautiful , magnificent and a must see at night-all lit up !",1
we were told we could get in line up to 10 minutes prior to our assigned time .,1
"most people come to paris just to see the eiffel and why not , everything about it is beautiful .",1
"they are not critical about time-slots so if you like come earlier , as we did .",1
we visited the eiffel tower on 14th feb night .,1
what a great way to view the city .,1
took many pictures .,1
the views are incredible and the light from the setting sun produced amazing photos !,1
was very crowded in the day owing to the euro 16 going on .,1
"we had virtually no lines at any point , despite not booking ahead .",1
"it started out more delicate than american audiences are used to , and ended with a jaw dropping bombastic display .",1
fun family atmosphere .,1
"there are better views of paris -lrb- arc de triomphe , sacre coeur -rrb- that include the eiffel tower .",1
"booked in advance , reached on time and took the first available lift to level 2 .",1
recognize its existence as a tower .,1
"there is no doubt that this place is amazing , the architecture , the built and the views .",1
little bit disapointing that the tower were closed when we got there .,1
a paris icon that must be visited .,1
glad we pre bought our tickets .,1
also a great sight to photograph from a distance .,1
"his name was ferit and he was knowledgeable and very interactive with the group , always engaging us .",1
it 's had to imagine just how large and dominant the tower is until you have stood beneath it and have viewed it from across the city .,1
"the only thing we ran into on the ground was a couple petition girls , just ignored them and they went away .",1
"you can buy some champagne at the top of the tower , but no bags or suitcases !",1
full of history and fame .,1
when in town you just have to take the opportunity of visiting this iconic piece of engineering .,1
isnt it ?,1
lovely and impressive each and every time .,1
the view on top is spectacular truly an awesome experience for me,1
we were also told that morning arrivals and waiting in a line may allow tickets to be obtained .,1
the downside is the amount of people there harassing you to buy selfie sticks and eiffel tower key rings -lrb- as with most tourist cities -rrb- .,1
the champagne at the top is great for a memory and a photo op but pricy -lrb- $ 20 / 4oz -rrb- .,1
we booked our tickets in advance and got to basically walk straight in .,1
after eating at 58 tour eiffel we went for a stroll up and round the eiffel tower .,1
there are a lot of fake solicitors asking for your signature for deaf children .,1
the line wrapped around the base of the tower itself .,1
visit it if for no other reason than to snap your photo at its feet .,1
"in the winter they set up an ice rink on the same floor , really an experience , and free to do once you 've paid your entry .",1
"the lift to the top although a little cramped was n't uncomfortable as they were carefully managed by the staff , but its all worth it for the breathtaking views from the top .",1
"what a fantastic monument to look at , what a fantastic view from up there !",1
"i know it 's a cliché , but as a tourist , i do n't care about being cliché ... : - -rrb-",1
"aside from getting robbed , actually going to the eiffel tower has nothing to offer .",1
"there were people selling tat -lrb- illegally most likely -rrb- around there and it spoilt it a little , although i guess you get this everywhere you go",1
a romantic meal at eiffel 58 which wasnt expensive and great views !!!,1
seeing the wonder through her eyes and the joy at being at such a famous landmark has inspired me to write this review to encourage others to share this experience with their loved ones .,1
i recommend going at sunset so you can see it during the day and during the night .,1
"no words can describe d feeling of standing in front of d tower n being amazed by its size , presence n design !",1
"this is an old structure , but still very amazing to see .",1
it would be great if the police would actually do something about all of the pickpockets pedaling their merchandise to distract .,1
"however , in case you do n't have a priority pass do budget for a couple of hrs before going",1
"thought it would be hokey , but it was not .",1
a beautiful structure much larger than i expected .,1
not sure it was worth going up .,1
"made it to the second floor , the top was closed .",1
the views from the summit are outstanding .,1
and also just to sit down and relax and enjoy the view .,1
"remember to wear comfortable shoes and do n't be afraid to walk up , lines are long .",1
i have to admit the line was hours long so we did n't go up but did stop for a bite while gazing upon the wonder of it !!,1
multiple ways to approach it - you can keep walking from champ elysees to eiffel .,1
we are quite happy that there 's not many people up there because this allows us more time and space to snap pix without being photo-bombed !,1
we loved this tour .,1
the views were very good but not worth the wait .,1
amazing engineering project all those years ago !,1
myself and the other half visited paris in march this year and were really looking forward to seeing the eiffle tower .,1
an amazing place to visit and spend some time,1
ques are long and is to be expected but there 's so much to see and do you wo n't be bored .,1
you have to go to the highest part of the tower to appreciate the view .,1
ca n't move around without bumping into a person on that day .,1
the eiffel tower is the eiffel tower !,1
we paid $ 5 each to walk up to level 2 of the eiffel tower .,1
"other than that , paris you have won me over .",1
"in the summer take some time to seat near the tower , drink some wine , wait for the sunset and then see the tower 's light .",1
and while you are up there why not have a glass of champagne .,1
have lunch or dinner there just so that you can say i did it .,1
we have guide walk us thought the city and entrance .,1
there had been recent concerts and bastille celebrations so the grounds were very cluttered .,1
you all know it 's great .,1
it was awesome,1
but you do feel safer now .,1
it is enduring .,1
buy the elevator ticket and enjoy .,1
"if you take the metro to the trocaderro stop you have the viewing platform , best at either early morning or sunset for the best pictures with the tower in full range behind and a view i did n't think could be improved upon .",1
we arrived about 15-20 minutes before the eiffel tower officially opened .,1
theres a lift all the way up though you have to buy this as a ticket.you can go up to the summit this too has to be bought as a ticket .,1
"unfortunately we had to take the lift to the next bit -lrb- the top -rrb- which was an awful queue and claustrophobic , too many people .",1
the picture is a lot nicer than visiting in person .,1
you do not need a ticket for the first security check -lrb- there are two locations to gain entrance to this area -rrb- you do need a ticket to enter the tower .,1
go all the way to the top !,1
you can stroll through the park that is in the front of it or walk along the river and come up that way .,1
amazing monument !,1
"we did not purchase our tickets in advance and discovered due to heightened security , there was no significant advantage to skipping the ticket line , since the security lines applied to all .",1
i would recommend arriving at the tower 30 minutes early ; the queue to get in is always really large and can take a long time to get through as there is a lot of security to pass through .,1
i was not convinced that this elevator ride would be worth it .,1
you have to experience the eiffel tower at night .,1
such a beautiful experience !!,1
the other side was quiet and had no wind .,1
"however , the views are still fabulous , there is no crowding , and an easy walk down to the first level affords access the restaurant , cafes , gift shops and toilets .",1
"i mean it is a majestic and grand work of arquitecture , the christmas lights are lovely , its beautiful",1
obviously security has intensified due to the world we live in now but this also makes you feel more at ease in truth .,1
this makes for a unique experience and view .,1
although nobody really bothered us we felt it was likely not the best place to be at night .,1
we was advised to visit on the sunday and we did n't waif very long for the lift .,1
we also had a clear night from the top of the arc to watch the eiffel tower light show which starts on the hour for a few minutes at night .,1
"as expected it was beautiful , we were lucky in that it was lit up ink and purple for breast cancer aareness adn we fit in a trip to the top last thing at night and so almost had the place to ourselves !",1
it is very reasonable and you have to go right up to the top !,1
wow what a great experience .,1
there are a few nice spots to take some pics look great with this symbol of love .,1
long queues to go up .,1
"start your visit to the et in trocadero , for the best views and great spots for photos .",1
the cost is to go to the second floor which is quite a way up and is reached by elevator .,1
a very fun trip and we also had a very good guide .,1
"if you visit paris , you definitely need to visit the eiffel tower and of course take the elevator to the top .",1
"be prepared for people , lots of people .",1
"they have managed to keep the prices affordable allowing everyone who wants to go , the opportunity to do so .",1
i get to experience this eiffel tower both day time and night time.my dream was to visit many iconic towers of the world and this one was spectacular .,1
really wish the police would not allow that type of hustlin going on .,1
"it 's not that bad , about 20-45 mins just like if we go to an amusement park .",1
this time i climbed the stairs up to the second level which was not overly hard .,1
we went back during the day to go to the 2nd level observation deck .,1
"at night , grab a bottle of beer , wine or champagne from one of the many street vendors walking around and sit in the grass .",1
ques not too long-little benches where one can sit and admire the tower or just soak up the ambiance of paris -,1
maybe they should consider booking climbs according to time .,1
the views are pretty special !,1
the views are similar to the first level and there are a few more shops and snack bars .,1
we walked up the eiffel tower today .,1
beautiful place with wonderful view .,1
"if you want a view of tower , hop on a river cruise .",1
"spend as much time as you want , because who knows when you 'll ever get back .",1
the tower is as beautiful as it was when we were here without kids in 99 .,1
"one of the seven wonders of the world , the eiffel tower is one of the must go attractions in paris .",1
just to have said i 've been there is amazing .,1
the shear size of the structure can not fail to impress .,1
"by the time she got the tickets , i was feeling very ill , i am diabetic as well as physically disabled , and no doubt the excessive heat was effecting me .",1
walk or take the elevator to ground level .,1
military looking people were everywhere also and this was before the bombing they had .,1
"good to look at , but you really need to spend at least a day or longer while passing through paris .",1
the tower and its story is great .,1
the view is breathtaking and a ` must do ' when visiting paris .,1
nice to have a shop up there so you can have a break before the 700 steps back down .,1
"did n't purchase a ticket before hand do started queuing about an hour before it opened , the queue got pretty big so best to pre purchase or get queuing early !",1
the best views are from the trocadero gardens or the champ de mars greenspace .,1
we began right on time - and went to the 2nd floor - enjoyed the view for 20 minutes and then decided to purchase tickets to the summit .,1
it is indeed an experience .,1
"there are peddlers everywhere trying to sell you souvenirs , and they come around every few seconds !",1
"once you get to the highest you can walk , you can still purchase an admission from the kiosks at that point , allowing you to take the elevator to the top .",1
"you have to go there to make sure it 's there , the same way you always see in post cards , filmes , etc. .",1
around eiffel tower lots of little souvenir shops and a carousel .,1
it was very romantic .,1
every hour on the hour their is a light show to our delight we never tired of it during our stay .,1
a masterpiece from eiffel ?,1
it 's 1 of -lrb- if not -rrb- the most amazing view in the world .,1
it is a perfect place on a clear sunny day for pictures and is a must see parisian sight !,1
"went right to the top of the tower , amazing views , shops and eateries .",1
it 's always like a dream before visiting eiffel tower in person .,1
they were so dissapointed that they could not go to the top .,1
there were little cute shops on the second floor .,1
the stairs felt very safe and were n't steep at all .,1
try to book your ticket online or via your hotel earlier to avoid the line .,1
"lunch at eiffel 58 was very well done , even though we were a small group on the tour , each lot of couples were given individual tables for 2 , which was nice !",1
"a very busy place full of the dreaded hawkers though -lrb- `` no , i do not want to buy a little eiffel tower trinket '' - prepare to say this 1 hundred times ! -rrb-",1
"if heights scare you , just go to the first or second levels .",1
the view from the second level was pretty gorgeous,1
they only had two cashier windows open at the time .,1
was such a romantic and memorable thing to do .,1
there are a few problems with the venders down there they do n't seem to understand the word no in particular an african man named barry starts making a bracelet and then takes what he feels is fare for a little bit of string tried taking $ 20 off me .,1
"if you go in the winter , there 's ice skating on level one -lrb- like us second floor -rrb- -- no charge to skate or for the skates .",1
"selfie sticks are ideal too , take one along :-rrb-",1
"you ca n't see much of the tower from the bottom of it , and there are better views of paris than from the top of it .",1
it 's windy at the top floor but it is worthy !,1
"patrols regular shoo them off , but they come back quickly .",1
it is way larger in-person .,1
we purchased macaroons on the 2nd level and ate them .,1
"we went only up to the 2nd level as time would not have allowed us to go to the top , but the views were still fantastic .",1
"and to third level , we got into lift .",1
the lines were quite quick even with the extra security check .,1
what a wonderful view of paris with all the attractions illuminated .,1
he initial ascent to level one goes fast .,1
go and have a glass of champagne !!,1
you can see the 360 degree paris .,1
maybe cues are too long and need to improve staff friendliness .,1
we were there during paris terrorist attacks so exhibit closed to go up .,1
the lights come on at night -lrb- usually around 10 in the summer -rrb- which is spectacular .,1
"however be warned there is no lift to the 2nd floor , you need to climb the stairs .",1
must do in your life .,1
the views were fantastic.was glad to get back down again .,1
it was the moment when we caught a distant glimpse of the eiffel tower that we knew for sure that we were in paris again .,1
"for us and many others , the eiffel tower is the unique symbol of paris .",1
this was our first time there and we quite enjoyed looking down through the clear floor panels at the people and grounds below .,1
book in advance and you can quickly queue to go up the elevator .,1
most are polite and you ca n't help but feel for their situation given the recent refugee crisis .,1
"come early , and if you can , make reservations in advance on the web .",1
"the eiffel tower is always magnificent no matter where you see it from , or what angle , far or close , sunny or cloudy , it 's just amazing !",1
it 's blessed to visit eiffel tower !,1
theres a restaurant up to top if your interested although i do n't think its cheap !,1
beautiful its worth the wait the view from top is amazing .,1
you would n't visit paris without seeing it !,1
"hey , it 's paris .",1
"everything you hear about it is true : the tower is amazing , the views outstanding , any organization lacking , and the crowds endless .",1
"- amazing structure , you can get some awesome pictures as well !",1
this is one of the great places .,1
a must when in partis,1
"make sure you go on a good weather day , or at dusk - to catch the sunset and the city lights .",1
saw the underground catacombs where we were informed that all of the food for the restaurants is now prepared .,1
an obvious must do when in paris .,1
"we were lucky with the weather , so the views were amazing .",1
definitely a tourist crazed place though .,1
there was a bit of a queue bit it moved along quickly .,1
it is just so massive and amazing .,1
we arrived at around 7pm and the queue for tickets was not long at all .,1
"i am a beach girl , my travels have always been carribean .",1
paris is a beautiful city at night and the tower is a much different experience in the dark .,1
do come back and get awestruck with the illumination at night !,1
it is definitely nice view and lot so eating places up on the tower ... soo enjoy the view !!,1
pay the extra $ $ and buy tour tickets in advance so that you can skip the line .,1
the details of the design are impressive by day .,1
my favorite .,1
so far this is the main attraction and a face of paris .,1
you take the stairs up and going down with the lift .,1
i highly recommend city wonders english tours and malin ' s fish and chips restaurant .,1
we got there early - the enormity is appreciated from close proximity .,1
you can not visit paris without a short trip to the eiffel tower .,1
"as i had heard you have to be crazy to go there without tickets , but the only way you could get tickets ahead of time on line was to buy a `` tour '' package for something like 50 euros each , which seemed like a ripoff .",1
"you know you want to go up , even if you pretend you do n't ... so embrace it and up you go .",1
"we had lunch here for my birthday and although it was quite pricey , it made the trip special .",1
we only spent the day in paris and had plenty of time to see the eiffel tower .,1
there were spectacular views from all sides of the tower !,1
even our guest who is a meat and potatoes guy enjoyed the food .,1
"i told you this is my 4th time right but this is the 1st time i have seen palais de royal from the top , & the 2nd floor .",1
we took some picture and then proceeded downwards via a lift .,1
"we saw the police asking street vendors for paperwork , so the usual trinkets were n't offered to us as we strolled around .",1
expect the usual security bag search before you head up .,1
"true , it is nice to locate specific buildings , such as sacre coer , the arc de triomphe , or even la defence from the eiffel -lrb- all these are lit up , and can also be seen at night , but are easier to identify in daytime -rrb- , but , the city of lights really lives up to its reputation at night .",1
"it was convenient , which was nice because of the rain .",1
"advance booked and timed tickets can help jump the huge queues at popular seasons but there is still the delays for security checks and for the double decker lift to the second level , the highest currently available .",1
took her to see the eiffel tower without explaining the top of the hour `` twinkling '' she giggled like a little kid !,1
a magnificent engineering structure that is unlikely ever to be matched in this modern world .,1
it has a lot more detail than anticipated .,1
the tower looked even beautiful when it started sparkling every hour .,1
the sight at the top impress us again ...,1
during the night in particular you 'll see the light `` show '' .,1
not well lit .,1
very nice skyline view from top the eiffel tower .,1
they views are amazing .,1
our hotel was a five minute walk to the eiffel tower .,1
"lots of people , nice pictures can be taken .",1
my paris tour included dinner in the eiffel tower which included the skip the line ticket .,1
i must admit i did n't go to the top as i 'm scared of highs .,1
being the city of lights i went up at 10pm and saw paris by night .,1
there are 3 floors you can visit but i do n't see why you would n't just pay for the top .,1
beside its looks .,1
getting tickets online saved us queueing time .,1
"although we did not make it to the top , we still had a great view of the city from the first landing .",1
i did n't go up into it due to height issues i have but it is quite majestic .,1
the view and ride up were spectacular .,1
"standing under the eiffel tower is very intimidating , this huge work of art is beyond belief unless standing underneath or looking at it from a distance -lrb- literally -rrb- !",1
"i took a guided tour , which helped me skip the queue and i loved the tour guide .",1
"-lrb- note that you do n't necessarily need one , you can go to the website and book tickets directly -rrb- .",1
stunning masterpiece .,1
we were lucky & got there early so the lines were n't very long .,1
i remembered words of some painter like `` i like to have dinner on eifel tower cause it 's the only place whre i ca n't see it '' .,1
"it is a metal structure and , honestly , not much more than that .",1
pay to skip the line because it 's worth it !,1
we took an afternoon tour -lrb- mistake -rrb- better to take a morning tour because it can get pretty warm in there .,1
you can get different mood of view and photos,1
you must do it if you are in paris but plan ahead and go the official website and book your admission .,1
it allows you to avoid all lines !,1
"make sure to stop by a local market and grab some bread , cheese and wine and pack a blanket and watch the sunset from the grounds around the eiffel tower .",1
you can access this via metro or bus .,1
totally magnificent and awesome .,1
the number one attraction to visit when in paris .,1
kids also loved the carousel.definitely worth a visit .,1
there are several gift shops on the lower levels and places to eat which is nice .,1
i 've been to the eiffel tower before but found this trip disappointing .,1
expect to wait to go back down !,1
the views from the top was amazing and breath taking i would highly recommend going to see it !,1
i made it to the top level and the views were amazing .,1
buy your tickets on line .,1
"but i 'll offer two bits of key advice - go early , and if you ca n't go early only go up to the second level .",1
nuff said .,1
"eiffel tower was one of my dream to visit , when i arrive in france it was my first place i had visit",1
the little one went off to a cafe with friends and i took my 7 year old up the tower .,1
guide was with us till 2nd floor and then were free to explore ` summit ' -lrb- top floor -rrb- at our own pace .,1
i 'm one of those eiffel tower lovers .,1
so what if it 's raining .,1
"no matter how many times you see it , elevate in it , it is still amazing !!",1
lovely clear day the views were amazing worth every penny did n't manage to go to the very time did n't get time .,1
you will see the entire city and will have the time for take the best pictures ever .,1
"the queue went down quickly as we walked up , however if going with young children i would recommend the lifts , they have longer queues but it is a long walk up !",1
must go .,1
"enjoy it at night , its spectacular .",1
there was snack food at the eiffel tower and there was food available on the first or second floor .,1
go to it just in the eve for day as well as night view .,1
"do not play the luck-games , there is no luck !",1
"what a city , a sighview , what a monument !!!",1
it was sunny and many people enjoyed their time at the park n front of the tower .,1
especially when our hotel was only a few minutes walk away .,1
"a tip for those trying to avoid the queues , it is worth buying the lunch they have in the eiffel restaurant , i got it for about # 75 for a three course for 2 adults and 1 child .",1
the eiffel tower is well worth a visit .,1
the perfect time to visit it is when the sun is going down so you can see both day and night view .,1
"although we did n't go to the top , we went up to the first deck for dining .",1
i also went to the top .,1
we went here a few times as my children were curious .,1
lots of pushy souvenir sellers on the grounds .,1
"the restaurant , eiffel 58 , is worth eating at and completes the view at night .",1
it is magical .,1
"this is definitely a must when visiting the city , lovely shops inside with some nice souvenirs .",1
we loved every minute and there is so much to do and see on the eiffel tower .,1
an amazing site .,1
it is always crowded .,1
ca n't help taking photos of the tower whenever i pass by it .,1
it is surely everyone 's top place to visit when they arrive in france .,1
the weather in december was more like a spring day and the whole experience was pure magic .,1
wonderful michelin-starred restaurant there too .,1
take the elevator up and walk down you get a better and grander feeling .,1
can see most of the paris 's monuments from there .,1
"it is tall , imposing , magnificent .",1
"waited a very long time for this , well over an hour .",1
"breathtaking , it 's a must do !",1
i advise you to be sure to climb to the top of the tower,1
"wait in queue for the ticket counter to open while on the 2nd level , for visiting the summit -lrb- it does n't remain open always -rrb- .",1
go to the very top first and then work you way back down .,1
"however , really enjoyed this experience and definitely recommend it !",1
this was our fifth visit to paris & can not understand why we did not go up the eiffel tower the first time.this time we came up in the late afternoon had dinner & waited till evening the best experience was at night .,1
we had my 80 year old mother with us .,1
the amazing light show is pretty inspiring .,1
the views from the 1st and 2nd levels are absolutely stunning .,1
"if you disregard the filthy old public restrooms , it 's still a great place to visit .",1
really interesting architecture and a great location to match .,1
i found eiffel tower quite average .,1
-lrb- p.s. .,1
nothing is better than seeing the eiffel tower from the base or the city of paris from the top .,1
"although we did not do the tour , we walked around the area in awe of what was a much grander and inspiring sight than we had expected .",1
"i said , `` look , look , '' and he looked , no longer panicked .",1
get a reservation and skip the lines -- the extra cost is worth it .,1
my daughters ticket was free and mine was 10euro .,1
i 'm sure there is a million reviews of the tower .,1
"nice view from the top , nothing can beat that .",1
"i did n't feel like i missed that much not going up.if you have any height fears , the elevator ride might not be for you .",1
go figure !!,1
"the security lines were very long , but we understood why .",1
barter with the guys selling souvenirs .,1
"`` try '' because if you have not planned you trip and already have your tickets , your in for a long wait - queue was 3/4 hours long !!",1
"great place , great environment and great moment to enjoy",1
"this was by far the highlight of my visit to paris , we arrived at 6.45 pm and waited for a couple of hours to get in , we saw the sun set on the second level , on the top levell it was getting dark so everything came alive from the ground it was amazing , a fantastic building , seen pictures on tv but so much better in real life , we all enjoyed our visit",1
make sure you book at least 6 months ahead if you are going in july/august .,1
just beware .,1
if you want to go with elevator it probably takes couple hours and feeling is not the same .,1
in july/2015 me and my family made a trip to europe and included paris .,1
"my boyfriend and i are healthy , gym-going 22 and 30 year olds and were still exhausted and out of breath after each level .",1
either in day or night !,1
i am so thankful i was blessed to see such a wonderful sight .,1
the views are just breathtaking .,1
great experience to go the the eiffel tower .,1
the place has some charm about it ... the ambiance is electrifying .,1
"we were ready at the eiffeltour around 10 am , the people at the douane were really nice and were joking around with us .",1
great city views from the top floor .,1
"later in the evening , we walked along the seine river and we got the best picture of eiffel .",1
too crowded and too many people selling cheap merchandise and making a tight space even tighter .,1
up close it 's even better .,1
we queued for around an hour before getting the lift up .,1
"definitely go at night , and try to see it during the day at some point !",1
"lift up stairs down , at least partially was our approach and it worked .",1
"im not disappointed at all , it is very beautiful and fascinated .",1
it also sparkles on the hour .,1
make sure you go at night starting at seven every hour .,1
absolutely breathtaking and a must see of paris .,1
one of the most beautifully sights i 've laid my eyes on my whole euro trip .,1
this has to be one of the most famous landmarks and seeing with your own eyes is amazing !,1
it 's great to go ... .,1
absolutely stunning view from all levels .,1
simply breathtaking !,1
a must see if in paris although not totally necessary to climb each time i think its splendour is in its presence but a must climb if you have n't done at least once,1
the new security makes things a mess .,1
"if you 're in paris , and there is no fog , you have to go to the eiffel tower .",1
watch for the sparking eiffel tower after dark .,1
take a picnic if you have children as they can play quite freely .,1
we managed to take a fun selfie to commemorate out visit .,1
i can never get enough of the eiffel tower - day & night .,1
the view is amazing and i 'll never be sick of it .,1
it was very wet and there was no queue !,1
very memorable !,1
it 's just a waste of time and money !,1
"what a shame , such a historic landmark .",1
glad i went .,1
we had read reviews before we went about the lift being really busy and to head for the stair queue .,1
we did and the tour guide ditched on the 90 minute tour .,1
be sure you hang out enjoying the view of the tower .,1
"the first time i took the stairs , and with my parents i took the west entrance for elevators only .",1
we did get a great scenic view from the second level .,1
we purchased hop on/hop off sight seeing bus tickets and there was a stop directly in front of the tower .,1
one of the wonders of the modern world .,1
arrive 15-30 minutes before do you get to see directly under the tower .,1
however my vegetarian wife found the sandwich too dry and bland for taste at the second level restaurant .,1
the eiffel tower doesnt even need a review .,1
"a must if in paris , both views in the morning at night are worth viewing !!",1
also make sure you are there at the top of an hour so you can see it sparkle for 5 minutes .,1
we bought tickets ahead on line with assigned time which included the ride to the top .,1
next trip i will make it to the top point ; - -rrb-,1
you will be gifted with a wonderful view of paris .,1
i would not go again .,1
"fortunately , the wait time did not seem excessive .",1
"sure , it 's crowded -- unless you visit early in the day .",1
just spoiled by guys selling cheap rubbish and so many beware of pick pocket signs everywhere,1
queued for an hour with our kindles and snacks to pass the time .,1
"i can not adequately express how totally amazing it was to have my birthday lunch in the eiffel tower in paris on my birthday , bastille day .",1
we went up before it got dark -lrb- maybe an hour and half before this -rrb- and stayed to look at the lights of both the city and the tower itself which were very pretty .,1
i had lunch with a friend in the restaurant on the first floor of the eiffel tower on the the 19th of july .,1
the wait to buy tickets were 30 minutes and tickets were n't too expensive .,1
if you want to go to the top must allow enough time as the lines can be long once you get to the second level .,1
"we did buy tickets ahead of time to go to the top of the tower , which i highly recommend .",1
but going up to the top is great .,1
amazing to see up close .,1
maybe 10 minutes per level ?,1
i never get sick of looking at this amazing structure .,1
it was raining really hard when we got out of our taxi at the eiffel tower so we were very grateful to have `` skip the line '' tickets in our hand .,1
great panoramic views of paris from the top of the tower and if you go later in the evening you can stay up there for the city to light up and have a look at the night view as well .,1
make sure you find the right line and if you have already purchased tickets it is so quick .,1
very cool !,1
i would have shouted ` police ' if they had .,1
one tick off my bucket list .,1
"if you have the time i would recommend a visit to the eiffel tower -lrb- preferably at the end of the day at sunset -rrb- , the views of paris from the eiffel are amazing .",1
"we did n't go up , but sat at the garden in the bottom with our lunch .",1
"we woke up , had breakfast , pass by , drank champagne beneath it , watch it lit up in golden dancing lights and went to bed with effiel tower as we stayed in pullman effiel tour .",1
"would definitely go , but now i have done it once i would n't be fussed going again .",1
view however is magnificent .,1
we stayed a couple blocks from the eiffel tower for the month of may and had a view from our flat .,1
we decided to leave and take some photos from the garden in front of it -lrb- which was also covered with fence ! -rrb-,1
but my children ask me for it several times so we did it .,1
when you see it you feel you 're dreaming .,1
"15 years ago , the highest stage had to be climbed via stairs .",1
it 's a beautiful tower and the symbol of paris .,1
no trip to paris is complete without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"go to the top , even if it costs more , the views of the city are incomparable and worth it .",1
we used a tour company through this app which i recommend as you do n't have to wait for the long lines !,1
"once up at the second level , it was quite a sight .",1
you ca n't visit paris & not see the eiffel tower .,1
people say ` go early ' but everyone does !,1
"while it is not the smoothest way to spend your day , it is quite a historic event going there and being at a place where millions have been .",1
i enjoyed going in the afternoon with a picnic until the light show came on !,1
it 's just as amazing as on tv and in postcards .,1
its equally magnificient at both times .,1
despite the rain and clouds it was an awesome experience .,1
this icon represents everything paris .,1
we spent most of our time at level 1 .,1
it is always nice to visit the eiffel tower .,1
jumped the first queue but come to a stand still waiting for the lift going up .,1
"once you lay eyes on it , realizing you are finally here .",1
i was in love .,1
a `` must do '' for each and every visitor in the city of light !,1
"if you 're in paris , this is of course a must , but the lines are ridiculous .",1
i have visited eiffel tower several times before but each time it is breath taking especially at night .,1
eiffel tower looks touristic during the day .,1
"staff were very friendly in the lifts , not so much on the tills .",1
there was an ice skating rink on the 1st floor which was such a memorable time .,1
"it is now smaller due to the glass walkway when you can see the street below but nevertheless , a very fun family time ,",1
the very iconic symbol of paris is really a must go when in paris .,1
it is a breathtaking sight .,1
we waited in the stairs queue for over 2hours but it was so worth it - you can see for miles and miles around ; a 360 degree view .,1
"despite that quick access to the first set of elevators , no one can skip the long lines ahead to get to the summit .",1
going up the eiffel tower is simply a must-do .,1
someone can say it 's just a piece of steel but in my words this tower is symbol of romance .,1
top of my list to see the tower for real and it was adorable !,1
cheap to get in and worth the experience various options including travel to top floor or save money by walking up,1
there he waited for us for 45 minutes .,1
"for a better experience , get your tickets in advance online and you 'll skip the queue , luckily for most , the ticket queue was quiet when we arrived - it must have been because it was a wet , cold , drizzly day .",1
there are queues for the lifts going down too .,1
"you can go up by elevator , but the lines for that are very long , and the elevator is crowded .",1
we were lucky and got a picture in a cloudless fall day .,1
went to the summit and glad we did .,1
"after we came down from the tower , we saw many tourists lining up .",1
we booked the '' to the top tower tickets '' in october .,1
you can not go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower !,1
we put this off until our last night in paris as we 'd been past a few times and seen the queue -lrb- which was horrendous -rrb- .,1
"a little touristy , but hey i 'm a tourist and nothing says paris like the eiffel tower",1
unfortunately for us only 11pm was available to half way up which we did n't think was worth it .,1
on our recent visit i really felt like a sardine in a can .,1
"we visited the eiffel tower around 9:30 am and was pleasantly surprised at the short queues ... we had been warned there is sometimes a two hour wait but early , rather than later in the day , seems the time to go .",1
"we have seen the eiffel tower on a number of occasions , but never at night .",1
there are almost more people selling knock-off trinkets than there are tourists .,1
"the tower is beautiful after dark once the lights switch on , it truly is breath taking at night .",1
"there is a park around the tower , so many people had food and drinks , lovely .",1
went there last week with my friends .,1
you ca n't go to paris and miss climbing the eiffel tower !!!,1
next time i want to climb the stairs to the top !,1
is a must to visit when you are in paris .,1
we have been in the late morning and went again mid-evening .,1
"several months before our visit , i went to the website and there was n't a single time available during our 3-day visit which was during the height of the tourist season .",1
"who can go to paris without visiting eiffel tower and taking a picture with it , a very nice open place and the view from above is just stunning yet you have to wait for a long time to be able to get in the elevetor",1
i highly recommend it !,1
not sure why i am leaving a review on this location when everyone knows it is a must see when in paris .,1
you can get the ticket from the ticket counter at eiffel tower .,1
if you are in paris you will see and visit the eiffel tower .,1
"everyone goes to the top of the eiffel tower , did you know you could visit the basement of the eiffel tower too .",1
we were thrilled to take the ride up to the top of the tower - it had been a dream of ours for a long time .,1
be there by 8.30 am .,1
we brought 43 .,1
go early -lrb- especially in the summer -rrb- .,1
by the time we got there -lrb- with many a curse word and horrid frustration -rrb- the view superseded all of our pain .,1
"had it been hot , i 'd definitely spend the extra money and take the time to stand in line .",1
"the design is amazing , the view fantastic , the location wonderful , and she is an awe-inspiring creation of mr. eiffel .",1
the views are different but equally magnificent .,1
"then we stood in line for maybe 10 minutes , if was super quiet and nice .",1
the queues are long !,1
anywhere !,1
"instead , i chose to go up the ferris wheel near louvre and watch eiffel tower from far .",1
"in the area , please keep your wits about you for pickpockets and scammers , as they are rife in this area and can spot a vulnerable tourist a mile off .",1
our tour guide was a young girl named aleranda -lrb- not sure on spelling .,1
"2nd floor is fine , no real added views fro the top - prebuy your tickets to avoid the long queue .",1
"however , this was only a small problem .",1
we only went to the 2nd or due to the weather but the view was still totally mind blowing .,1
particularly at night !,1
the tower offers overview of whole paris .,1
"the view , of course , is fantastic .",1
overall you have to it .,1
that 's the feeling you get even after seeing it a million times !!,1
i just went just for the sake of coming .,1
a very interesting place of my choice .,1
the views from the top are incredible and well-worth queuing for .,1
this structure was awesome and is the most visited attraction in the world .,1
lives up to its reputation .,1
"do n't bother with tours or guides , just head up and take your time .",1
j'adore !,1
"we decided to go for an early morning visit , there were no queues for security , purchasing the ticket or the lifts .",1
it is simply beautiful .,1
the most beautiful city !!!,1
"an amazing experience with plenty of shops , cafes etc all the way up and down .",1
feeling very much unsafe !,1
when going up the tower it 's definitely worth going up to the 2nd viewing platform as you get an even better and vast view of paris,1
"try to go in the evening/night as the lights illuminate , and it sparkles every hour .",1
"my own expectations are probably why i was quite disappointed by it , however , i would say that the view when going up it is very impressive , at least in comparison to the tower itself .",1
"the feeling is amazing , chill wind , entire paris on view .",1
it has become such an icon for the parisians that that need to come up with a better system .,1
"a tip though , as much as buying a glass of fizz on the top floor seems like a special thing , the reality is a luke warm glass of 13 euro champagne ... .",1
"yes , it 's a touristy thing to do , but it 's a must !",1
"also , the street food restauranta are good and worth a try .",1
it 's a slightly longer walk but a better view in my opinion .,1
"also , you get amazing pictures by walking to the trocadero which is opposite the eiffel .",1
we decided we had seen enough .,1
because of security the lines move a little slower to get under the tower .,1
this iconic structure is history = be a part of it !,1
"we were in paris last summer and it was not like that , but unfortunately times have changed .",1
you can admire the fascinating view of paris city even if you dont go to the top .,1
no words needed for this great piece of art .,1
to be expected i suppose .,1
and it definitely is a must see .,1
the mistake we did was not see this magnificent structure in the night .,1
we had a guide that sped us through the lines and detailed the history of the tower .,1
make sure to visit all three levels for interesting facts & different perspectives .,1
you have the choice to select fish or meat .,1
once we came to ground we were able to view the tower lights from across the street while eating crepes .,1
"it 's a trite comment , but the eiffel tower is iconic paris .",1
we were able to navigate the security process fairly easy .,1
it gave us views of the entire city .,1
"obviously beautiful , but similarly without any great usp as such , a simple but decorative radio tower built in 700 days and marketing makes it greatest towers of all time , wow , i am jealous .",1
we had tried to pre book tickets but even 3 weeks in advance could not book a slot during our stay .,1
"it was a dream trip of paris , especially the eiffel tower !!",1
incredible views,1
truly a remarkable place .,1
the view is different at different times of the day .,1
"in my opinion , if you come to paris , you must go up in the eiffel tower .",1
beautiful gardens and amazing view .,1
the eiffel tower is so familiar to everyone because of its popularity in pictures and movies .,1
there were not many people climbing at 7:30 pm so we were able to keep our pace .,1
totally worth visiting !,1
so beautiful and amazing .,1
will try again next time .,1
i wish my boo would have been there with me though .,1
expect to wait .,1
"i decided to get off at this floor and have a look at the glass floor - it was pretty amazing , but my legs did feel a bit jelly like when i stood on it !",1
"my son loved the tower , he was so happy .",1
it was definitely a must do on my bucket list that i was able to check off .,1
bring enough time to get a ticket and for waiting in line .,1
not the best place to by mementos from the vendors who would approach you and if you do make sure u bargain .,1
or at least i think that 's what he was doing .,1
"they are easy to spot , they are female and carrying fake partitions and asking you to sign them .",1
"we continued with our plans , saw the sunset got amazing shots of paris at night .",1
or paris for that reason !!!!!,1
"did not prefer the atmosphere at night , sellers can be aggressive with trying to sell wine and souvenirs .",1
going with pre booked tickets was very confusing as there was only a buy tickets now que and the pre booked was blocked off so we had to jump over the metal railing to access it so off to a strange start !,1
"the eiffel tower is everything you expect it to be , even more so at night when its all lit up .",1
i went on a friday night and it was so cold .,1
it 's beautiful at any time of the day or night .,1
the lines were unbelievably long of course .,1
after keeping my eyes closed on the elevator ride up i felt comfortable for the visit to both 2nd and the 1st floors .,1
"regret not going to top as we were too scared ,",1
the queue on the 2nd floor to buy tickets to travel on further to the top was about 45mins but the views on all the floors were incredible .,1
"whether you see it during the day or lit up at night , it 's breathtaking .",1
it is an awesome sight to see the eiffel tower .,1
"recommended taking the tour with a guide , it certainly upgrades the experience .",1
even for someone afraid of heights-like myself - the view from the top was worth it !,1
it was wonderful .,1
the tower was packed with visitors from everywhere .,1
went up the tower late on a weekday afternoon just as the sun was setting ad the views were brilliant .,1
"having bought tickets with cash , we went through the security checks and waited in another queue to ascend in the elevator .",1
the lights will be put on in the evening and very frequently the whole tower would be sparkling with lights.its a real delight to watch the tower.there is elevator to reach the top and you can stop in between floors as well before reaching the top.there are some cafe at the tower as well.the best place to click your pictures !!,1
"just great , the view from the top is incredible .",1
we thoroughly enjoyed having lunch in a lovely restaurant on the first level .,1
we arrived in paris in the late morning and had a tour booked for 5:30 pm that afternoon .,1
our second visit here and we decided to go in the evening for a different view from last time .,1
the tower is amazing and very easy to get to .,1
it is so incredibly massive but graceful at the same time .,1
the metro stopping nearest to the tower was shut for work this summer -lrb- we only figured this out when we saw the picture of some kind of mole in a yellow hard hat on posters in the metro -rrb- and as we were not confident with the replacement bus service we had quite a long walk from the stop where we got off the metro .,1
easy to find them and get our tickets .,1
i went straight to the top and worked my way down .,1
"long queues so we did n't go inside , but impressive just to walk around the base .",1
the paris day tour by grayline was an excellent choice for our family .,1
"if you really want to take some exceptional pictures , you can walk around the tower and take pictures from some of the surrounding streets .",1
we really enjoyed stretching our legs and getting a little exercise .,1
/ /,1
a must see of paris for the collection of sites available two floors to site see for with great pics,1
the views are worth the time and the glass floor views are also great .,1
visited eiffel tower with family .,1
you can not visit paris without a trip up the eiffel tower .,1
"shops were a bit pricey , better to go to shops nearby .",1
one thing that was a must is purchasing the tickets online which allowed us to skip the really long queue and almost go straight in -lrb- we had to go through security -rrb- .,1
both security men were too busy looking at their phones & to have 2 queues going at a snails pace in extreme heat is not my idea of fun .,1
we have dined in eiffel 58 which is the first of the two restaurants and is located at the first landing as you go up the lift - worth every penny i spent to be able to see the magnificent views of paris and enjoy some good food to boot !!,1
a visit is an absolute must !,1
"honestly , from an objective standpoint , i did n't think the eiffel tower was that great .",1
walk on stairs not for the faint hearted .,1
we were there in july and people were waiting for 2.5 hours !,1
maybe it 's because i 've been there before .,1
"you can buy tickets to the top from there , though we decided not to go all the way up .",1
it is a symbol of paris .,1
"we went up to the third floor , stayed for the sunset , and then came back down to the second floor .",1
"when you get into the elevator to go up , be prepared to get cozy with all those around as they pack in as many as possible .",1
"enjoyed the tower , the grounds and the general atmosphere .",1
"when purchasing advance tickets , the 8pm time slot is a great choice for springtime because you can see the city in daytime , sunset , and night views .",1
"if weather is not so good , leave it for next day .",1
we walked around and enjoyed a macaron or two .,1
"we had dinner at a nearby restaurant , and walked past just as the lights came on .",1
"we had an amazing visit to the eiffel tower , it was a perfect day and you could see for for miles .",1
definitely worth the trip all of the way to the top .,1
if you are physically able i recommend doing this .,1
"waited in line for about up an hour in freezing cold , but being at the eiffel tower was worth it .",1
we went for three days-two nights .,1
try the restaurant 58 its worth it .,1
the twinkling light show every hour after dark is a treat to the eyes .,1
paid 29 euro for 2 people to go to top of tower but was worth it with the views .,1
not advisable for travellers with vertigo or who have a phobia of heights .,1
it is worth it for once in a lifetime experience !,1
"walking along the seine , with the famous tower in the background is a fine way to appreciate the monument if you have seen it before and taken photos from the top ...",1
"unfortunately , i could not enter inside the tower and could n't enjoy the city from the top of the tower .",1
"it 's a reall tourist attraction with candy , popcorn , ice-cream bars nearby , postcards a roundabout for the kids and street sellers .",1
and would you come all the way to paris and not visit just because of some bad tripadvisor reviews ?!,1
yes it is worth the long wait in line .,1
when the tower was in the planning stages many protested it 's construction calling it `` useless and monstrous '' and suggesting it would cast `` hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal '' over the great sights of paris .,1
the structure is just impressive and its amazing that it was built back when it was .,1
it really must be seen and ascended to appreciate its magnificence .,1
the cost of going to the top is 17 euros for adults but it 's definitaly money well spent .,1
"all along the strolling lanes was just ugly as well , potholes , no flowers or the loveliness i was expecting .",1
"this allowed us to start moving up the tower as the sun started to set , giving us an amazing evening view from the top at night -lrb- based on our visit date - check the sunset schedule if you are interesting in an evening view -rrb- .",1
although i must say to those wanting to go up that the queue for the tickets was n't long at all .,1
we walked there the first night from our hotel and was so impressed .,1
we bought a ticket for the elevator to the first floor as the stairs looked slippery in the rain .,1
"the first lifts take you to the 117 meter level where a smaller lift to take you to the top but again , another half hour wait may be incurred to reach the summit due to the visitor congestion .",1
really one of the most interesting and excellent places to be seen .,1
"just amazing , as everybody knows !!!",1
it sparkles .,1
pretty special view .,1
the ticket had a date and exact time of entry printed on it .,1
unfortunately for us it was a cold bleak day with a spot of wind and rain to make for an unpleasant visit .,1
"loved the tower and wasnt brave enough for top level , but 2nd level was more than enough for some great pictures",1
we booked through fat tire .,1
my tip it will you queueing you get priority entry to the first and second levels .,1
we purchased tickets before we went on our trip to paris so we did not have to stand in the long lines for tickets .,1
"i was came around 7.00-9 .00 , before sunset , effiel still spectacular for me altought maybe i have came here around 8 times and after sunset effiel more beautiful with the light .",1
"because one elevator was closed , one is closed to diners exclusively , i think those in the regular line got in before us .",1
also we strolled in the area taking some photos naturally .,1
this is a must in your family trip to paris .,1
ca n't miss attraction in paris .,1
top view is just so amazing and has an interesting story of how it was built .,1
"our visit was late afternoon and although the crowd control was well managed , having to shuffle along in a queue and then cram into the lift detracted from the experience .",1
"take your photos from the bottom , holding on to your wallet , and spend more time at other paris attractions .",1
so when in paris you must go andd see it .,1
the are was n't that crowded what i expected .,1
"you could get through security and take pictures around and under the et , but you could not go up the tower .",1
we hiked up to the 2nd balcony and were greeted with views all around .,1
problem is the long queue .,1
best to visit during late evening to witness the excellent lighting on the tower .,1
"underneath the tower is interesting too including the unique view , the attractions and the people watching .",1
"eiffel tower was a monument created for a world fair held in 1889 , for which land was given on 20 years lease .",1
but do n't go up if you did not make reservation on the web .,1
"this is the lesson to be learned by every tourism ministry all over the world , french people eat , sleep and market this tower over centuries now .",1
just get there early and buy tickets in advance .,1
we `` did the most '' when we visited the eiffel tower .,1
"during morning is better to go there , is no so full .",1
"this tour was one of the better ones we 've done and would recommend it to secure a time slot , beat the queues , and have a good professional explanation of the history and significance of the tower .",1
"be careful of the girls running round asking for signatures and money , it 's a scam .",1
capped the visit with macarons from la notre which they have at the tower .,1
"we went for an evening , and paris at night is very beautiful .",1
"you can also bring wine to the green , which makes for a pretty lovely , relaxing time .",1
personally i love seeing eh tower from far away .,1
you really get a feel for the tower if you walk it .,1
it 's majestic and never forget to dine in the restaurant on the top,1
"right from the time you collect to meet the tour guide , hear the initial history , walk down in excitement to the base of the tower to be transported in a swoosh to second floor of the tower to see paris , the city which nevers sleeps at night .",1
its surely a must do .,1
make sure you go to the top platform as this is where you will really enjoy the visit .,1
i ca n't imagine what the lines would be like in the peak of summer !,1
"we had no line and just strolled up to the lift.we went at night which i would recommend , the lights are amazing and the light show is every hour .",1
"for a second and/or more experienced visit , there are other places to get a wonderful view of the city",1
i love visiting the eifel tower !,1
it really is the symbol of paris .,1
very crowded and busy at day .,1
we walked underneath and then took shelter at a nearby souvenir shop .,1
"we were walking up to the second platform which we overall did without great effort , thereafter we had no other choice than to take the lift .",1
go along the park and see it getting closer and closer .,1
worth the high admission cost .,1
"no , it was perfect .",1
a must do if in paris .,1
"of course it is a must see , but i am not sure it is a must going up , too long queues , a little expensive for what you get and kind of a letdown .",1
go at night to see all of the lights and pay the money to go up !,1
happy ending of our eiffel tower trip .,1
the history behind how the louve came to be is interesting .,1
queue wasnt too long as it was a dull day .,1
my first trip to paris .,1
"beautiful , simply beautiful .",1
then you skip the queue to go up the tower and go up to the second floor and the guide takes you around the four sides to look at the different views and points out some of the important landmarks .,1
the tower ?,1
"the top tier was closed for a bit while we were there , so did n't have a chance to make it all the way up .",1
"when we went in january 2016 , they had an ice rink on the 1st floor .",1
"it 's a cliché place to visit , sure , for tourists .",1
"yes , the eiffel tower seems to be the obvious choice for tourists , however it has that reputation for a reason .",1
it 's a must see even if you do n't go up .,1
it 's a must see at night and also flickers its light for charm .,1
"do not miss the action on the first floor with the glass floor and the video presentation of the towers history , food on second floor is great !",1
some landmarks do not need any assessment or evaluation to determine their ranks or fame .,1
i was so disappointed .,1
at the top you will see whole beautifull paris like an eagle .,1
"we queued for just over an hour to go in - and yes , security is more evident , but strangely comforting , with armed soldiers patrolling the area and airport style xray machines for bags and walk-through metal alarms at the entrance - but once you are through and actually inside the frame itself , it is thrilling and enchanting .",1
we spent about three hours at this glorious monument .,1
it is worth going to the top and buying the ticket for the elevator .,1
"we did not go up , as the queues were long , but we weent to get pictures of the tower its self , not pictures from the tower",1
"actually found the 2nd floor a little scarier than the top , as the 2nd floor is more ` open ' .",1
an absolute memorable visit .,1
the line is always long but it is totally worth it .,1
a great experience day or night .,1
i got some wine and cheese and watched the lights come on from the park in front - a highlight of my trip,1
restaurant 58 was bit of a disappointment foodwise + we were not able to get the lift tickets from that floor although we had been told so by the restaurant staff .,1
afterwards my friend and i had a traditional crepe once we abandoned the tower .,1
"its magnificent , especially during night , go till 3rd floor .",1
also they say they are open till nearly midnight the lift to the summit closes much earlier -lrb- last up about 10.15 -rrb- and they do n't advertise this and will still let you pay .,1
we waited maybe 10minutes to go up after the guide got our tickets and left us to it .,1
lights up at night and has grassy areas to lounge around and watch the tower lights .,1
it was a great way to spend an afternoon of walking and boat rides .,1
am so glad we went .,1
we were soon on the level about one third up .,1
visiting the eiffel tower is a must in paris .,1
"do not let the comments on other forums discourage you from trying the line , save yourself good $ $ $ , go early , prepare yourself for the beauty and magnitude of the place and enjoy the wait -- underneath the eiffel tower !",1
we did this as part of a skip the line tour at night .,1
"back after 5 years , we noticed an increasing security sensation .",1
the restaurants warrant thinking about .,1
"the lines in august are very , very long !",1
i have visited on second level and the view is very good from top and lift capacity is of 35 to 40 at a time .,1
"i would give this five stars , but the enjoyment of the eiffel tower was diminished by the huge crush of people who were also there .",1
we walked around and checked it out from many angles and all were impressive !,1
i also found that not looking up while waiting in the line before the climb was very helpful .,1
a trip to paris would not be complete without seeing the eiffel tower .,1
yes it is expensive and yes you will wait in lines but its a tourist attraction what else do you expect !,1
"the very symbol of france , what a marvelous feat of engineering in its day .",1
the place is amazing .,1
"the eiffel tower is all its suppose to be beautiful , the lights are bright .",1
"be careful of thieves , of course , as they love this place .",1
another must is to go up to the third floor -lrb- last floor -rrb- to see paris 's landscape and buildings .,1
"the view is spectacular , it is something that anyone should see .",1
"we went right to the top after going to the second floor , and could not believe how beautiful it was .",1
we got to skip it & head straight through security .,1
visited with my wife and son .,1
we arrived to the eiffel tower in the middle of the day a week before easter holidays .,1
the eiffel tower is arguably the most famous edifice in france and epitomises paris the world over .,1
it was one of those rare moments in life when you know that you have done something that is hard to top .,1
we had great views over the whole city .,1
all that walk was worth it when i got see it for the first time .,1
we ended up going all the way to the top and it was one of the few things the kids loved doing -lrb- not a museum type crew -rrb- .,1
"the elevator on our way down broke down so we were stuck up there for about an hour , but all good .",1
bucket list for sure !,1
security is pretty tight so we felt safe .,1
"however , once was enough for me .",1
"i must say when you take the long waiting line and reach to the top of eiffel , view is amazing for sure but i must say if you are not so interested in seeing the roofs of the apartments in paris , it is not worth to wait .",1
"from the eiffel , you can also walk up to the triomphe de arc .",1
we were lucky to get great weather in december .,1
lovely atmosphere .,1
eiffel tower is one of those places that is a -lrb- must visit -rrb- .,1
also good restrooms there .,1
you can also make a reservation for a once-in-a-lifetime meal .,1
we went to eiffel tower while it was drizzling .,1
this was my third visit to the eiffel tower .,1
the wait is no longer than 30 minutes on average .,1
as night falls the tower is lit and ` twinkles ' .,1
"go at dusk if possible , so you can see the different attractions and historical sites , and then see the city of lights at night .",1
the first time is the best .,1
no words to describe this monument .,1
"brill , expensive for a group but any young person under about 25 can get a concession as eu youth as long as passport",1
beautiful place to visit .,1
take inline to very top .,1
this is a must do when visiting paris .,1
when you 're in paris you have to go up the eiffel tower .,1
the view and just the experience was amazing .,1
please note there are two lines you wait in to get to the top .,1
"you will need to clear another security control point to go up the elevators , allow time .",1
and surrounded by street vendors .,1
expect rude tourists with selfie sticks .,1
"i would advise tickets to the summit after dark to see paris laid out at your feet , superb .",1
too much scammers all around paris !,1
it is so very large that seeing it in pictures does not do it justice .,1
"but you do have to keep your eye on some really dodgy people pickpocket is a big problem so be aware , good food and some nice locals .",1
i regret not going up the tower as i did not pre-book and the queues were horrific .,1
we purchased our tickets online .,1
"make sure to go across the river to trocadero for great pictures back towards the tower , and plan to come back at night to watch the light show that happens on the hour .",1
"lifts take a long time , but great if problems with mobility .",1
this is one of the most notable landmarks in the world .,1
i always go to visit her when i am in paris .,1
take a light jumper with you as it can get chilly up there even in summer time .,1
we arrived at the eiffel around 6pm .,1
eiffel tower : is the main attraction of paris and is worth it ... .,1
"if s you see nothing else in paris , dont miss the light show on the tower .",1
seeing and going up in the eiffel tower is a must .,1
"a small gift shop with overpriced souvenirs and a few food stalls , which were n't actually as expensive as i expected .",1
best piece of advice i can give is to pre book and pay online and you can pick your time .,1
the views are fantastic on a clear day and good on an overcast day .,1
there are two lifts to bring you to the top of the tower -lrb- but you have to pay extra if you want to visit the top -rrb- .,1
"a must when in paris , loved the different lights at night from hotel room , very busy in summer .",1
not sure why .,1
still when i think about it it makes me speechless - words cant describe how amazing it is to be with your loved ones seeing a view like that !,1
"but , it 's definitely worth bringing something you can munch and eat because there are plenty of beautiful places to park it outside and just relax .",1
i must say that i am a little disappointed .,1
amazing engineering of its day .,1
signs everywhere warn of pickpocket people .,1
this tower has a lots of history attached to it !!,1
"its stunning , go in the evening to see the light show !",1
1 .,1
"like a fairies sprinkling pixie dust -lrb- as my daughters friend describes it -rrb- if you are in the gardens beside the tower , you can sit on the grass gazing at the tower eating food and drinking wine or beer which are being sold by several vendors walking around .",1
you can get on and off the bus to visit any area that interests you .,1
however to truly enjoy the splendor of the tower one must remember to plan well in advance .,1
lines are extremely long .,1
nice to see during the day and besure to go again at night .,1
"lovely to have been to the top of the eiffel tower and i 'd recommend it if you 've never been , but equally good views can be seen from the sacre-coeur for free and without the massive queue -lrb- to get in and then again to get the second lift to the top -rrb- .",1
we went up to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
you must visit if only just to stand under it and take in the atmosphere,1
definitely get advanced tickets to avoid the lines .,1
that was very impressing and filled one with a sense of world unity .,1
the metal work is elaborate and decorative .,1
i got to see it lit up with the belgium flag at night after the terrorist attacks and i thought it was an amazing thing that paris did .,1
i was glad i got to see and travel to the top of the tower but the crowd made it really kinda crazy .,1
a fantastic beautiful landmark .,1
it was definitely a bucket list item to check off .,1
"take the elevator to the very top for amazing , if windy , views of the city .",1
the views of the city are incredible as is the structure itself .,1
do n't be deterred by the lines .,1
how can you miss this part of the city of lights ?,1
we had window seats and looked out to the carousels .,1
with clear signs everywhere and announcements my husband did n't pay attention put his guard down and placed his phone in his side coat pocket .,1
great views over paris .,1
pay the extra fee and whoosh your way up to the tower !,1
once up it was very high but beautiful and my gosh windy haha !,1
"we visited the eiffel tower twice , but decided not wait in line for the ride to the top .",1
what can one say it is the eiffel tower !,1
would recommend for everyone !,1
"a must to visit when in paris of course , wonderful visit for memory lane .",1
nothing really interesting to see as paris is quite flat .,1
you should climb it .,1
how can you go to paris and not go up the eiffel tower ?,1
we went at dusk and got to see the lights of paris come on .,1
time went fast and once on the tower it was brilliant .,1
nicer photos taken in the evening than day time when the tower lights up .,1
it was worth the wait though ... stunning views .,1
"wanting to shorten the wait , we opted to wait in the smaller line which was for the stairs to the 1st stage .",1
"absolutely amazing , we booked in advance and avoided the ticket queues .",1
"however , please know the crowds and all that means , will be great also .",1
had to have a champers at the top but tres tres expensive at 13 euro a glass !,1
it gives us an excuse to visit again .,1
"however , once i got to the top it was incredible .",1
"top tip 2 - you do n't need to go all the way to the top : the view from lower levels is fine , if not better .",1
the extra charge for the service was well worth while and is available on the internet,1
"visited the tower on a cloudy day , so the views from the 1st and 2nd levels were good , but not spectacular .",1
there are people around selling miniature eiffel towers and other kitshy stuff .,1
you have to buy a lift ticket then go to the elevator on the opposite side of the tower .,1
lines .,1
it 's a definite must see for first time visitors .,1
best views are from the second floor and the surrounding park offers nice grounds for piknik afterwards .,1
for me it was the best point during my paris trip .,1
it would be good to go in late afternoon so that you can click picture during the day time and also once the lights are on .,1
we only went to the second floor and it was plenty .,1
the history surrounding the eiffel tower is really cool .,1
nice to hear more about the tower than i expected and to see the bunker and the engine room .,1
it became busier towards 10:00 am .,1
the crowds in general were n't too large but one of the elevators that goes to the lowest level of the tower was not working .,1
i believe every visitor of paris will definitely go to eiffel tower and arc de triomphe .,1
the views were amazing but it was very windy .,1
we went .,1
"the official site says it is all full , but expensive 3rd party tickets are available !",1
"a real must the lift is easy to get up to second and 3rd floor , restaurant has to be pre booked when busy period .",1
get there early-ish .,1
perveyors of wine making iced bottles and glasses available to the crowd .,1
"the employees are nice and kind , though .",1
we did a night cruise -lrb- bateaux vedettes du pont -rrb- on the seine river and got to see the tower lit up at night - magical !,1
the queue for the summit is manageable and worth the wait,1
"young woman or children may approach you and ask , `` do you speak english ? ''",1
a beautiful work done by mr. eiffel .,1
"going up can be a busy experience , and if you are afraid of heights , dont go up .",1
i came back at night another day and took the stairs up .,1
"take the walk up to viewing area , eat at the restaurant , people watch and enjoy !!",1
he was knowledgeable and personable .,1
long security checks and far too many tourists everywhere .,1
"it 's cold and windy , so bring a jacket !",1
"if you feel real athletic , stairs are available .",1
it isnt a great romantic place as it is marketed to be .,1
the evening light show made me gasp when it first went on .,1
but if you do n't want to be inundated with souvenir stands and waiting in line you might appreciate the tower from a botbus on the seine .,1
very nice place to visit again .,1
"my sister on the other hand went to the top and said she thought she would be blown off it , as it was that windy .",1
it 's interesting construction and when lit up at night quite spectacular,1
"must make earlier arrangements , if you dislike to stay in queues for hours .",1
only rating it a four as the second floor was closed due to the fog but otherwise it was beautiful .,1
what an awesome view .,1
also it has twinkling lights every hour on the hour which was cool,1
it was a zoo !,1
"because really , what is there to say about the eiffel tower that was n't already said ?",1
"we waited in line for close to 45 minutes , and it was well worth it .",1
buying online is the best option .,1
can get individual eiffel tower tours .,1
as it was a bit of a celebration for us we did have the champagne toast at the top and the view did not disappoint .,1
go the whole hog and have the `` special '' flutes .,1
it is very much part of a paris visit .,1
better if you go in to the park next to it ... .,1
did n't get to go up it as my partner is a bit of jessie when it comes to heights but still pretty impressive especially at night when it 's all lit up .,1
so romantic and breathtaking .,1
now they do a bag check before you enter the tower area and that itself is another long queue .,1
"sydney opera , liberty , great wall , golden gate , iguazú waterfalls , cristo redentor , burj khalifa , tower bridge , basilica sancti petri and the eifel tower take the stairs , it is impressive",1
"it may just be another landmark but at night , when lit up or during the few mins an hour when it twinkles it takes your breath away .",1
"this is the most iconic attraction in the city of love , and one of the most famous in the world .",1
"no line on the ground floor at all , walked right in and got in the elevator .",1
an iconic landmark for paris & it lived up to it 's reputation .,1
crossroads for major avenues in and out of paris .,1
then went the top floor with another lift .,1
"we hung around there , but decided we 'd return when we could go see the top .",1
the tower is probably best viewed from a distance anyway .,1
"to go back to ground floor , you can use the lift , without aditional charge .",1
the ambiance surrounding the tour is magical !,1
the views are mind blowing from all levels .,1
"i would n't return , it 's one of those things which is now ticked off the list .",1
my husband took me to paris on our 25th anniversary and it was unforgettable !!,1
you can have a wonderful eiffel tower experience just like we did as long as you take the right precautions .,1
beware of pickpockets near security lines .,1
great to experience the eiffel tower .,1
you just have to fo to eiffel when visiting paris .,1
but it was worth the query .,1
well after waiting for a couple of hours we finally got there .,1
loveee !!,1
"i 'm not afraid of heights but these stairs you could see through and being so high up , i was nervous and took my time walking down .",1
"it 's there eiffel , what more can you say .",1
we did the eiffel tower by night & it was a majestic sight .,1
well worth the cramped elevator ride to the top .,1
"obviously if you come to paris , you have to stop and visit here .",1
"when visiting the eiffel tower , be sure to go to the sumit .",1
the walk down however ; was tiring .,1
"i were in needed of someone to give a pinch when finally arrives at the tower of eiffel , felt like hard to believe that i finally made it up to this far .",1
the queue is endless !,1
an area right next to the main tourist grass patch was excellent .,1
its a long wait to get to the top so did n't bother as there is so much more to see of paris .,1
"no i 'm not sarcastic , it was kind of magical .",1
worth seeing during the day and at night .,1
the views were not as clear as those earlier from montmartre due to a change in the weather .,1
we get a text 3 hours before our tour saying they were cancelling because they could n't get tickets .,1
she 's a beautiful work of art .,1
for the eiffel tower .,1
there is one restaurant that serves snacks .,1
we also observed a very visible military presence with both french naval and army paratrooper patrols at high profile sites during our visit .,1
allow 2 hours to do this .,1
the rains did play a spoilsport but we were way too much excited about our trip & also to watch the roland garros .,1
i 've been dreaming of climbing the eiffel tower since i was 12 .,1
but we just went on another night just to see the eiffel tower lights from the ground - which is beautiful as well !,1
unfortunately because of weather condition the boat trip was cancelled but we are able to go back and used the voucher within a year .,1
queues were long but it 's worth it .,1
"we came back just for that , it 's breath taking .",1
at the summit it was packed -lrb- both levels -rrb- .,1
"also if you go up to the very top , make sure you have a scarf and/or jacket because it 's cold !",1
"we took dozens of photos , and went on to visit several other tourist sites in paris .",1
so glad we did !,1
the only drawback are the security lines because at times they can be quite long .,1
one night we took a yacht ride down the seine and seeing the lights from the boat was truly amazing .,1
in a cold wind body to body with a lot of warnings against pickpockets and that we should report any unattended object ... i did ´ t feel good at all .,1
great views overlooking paris,1
"due to unpredictable weather , making reservatins is somewhat risky .",1
the eiffel tower is amazing and a must do while in paris .,1
one can visit this place without any help from tour operators .,1
and visited on a cloudy day - there were few lines until we reached the second floor .,1
of course there are all the tourist aspects and hawkers around but that 's part of the fun .,1
rush your way to the top before enjoying the mid-tower view .,1
a great experience .,1
"although there were a lot of people around , it did n't feel crowded as the space is huge around the tower .",1
i loved seeing where we had walked earlier that day and realising just how far we had travelled !,1
another 15 minutes to wait for security scanning .,1
also queues are shorter at nighttime .,1
we then had a shorter queue to get up to the summit .,1
"we came here because we were in paris and that 's what one does ... however it was very overcrowded , huge queues for everything and all food in surrounding area ridiculously expensive .",1
"also , be around the tower at the hour , as every hour there is a 10 min lighting show which makes eiffel `` eiffel '' .",1
"stunningly positioned between the banks of the seine and the grand park , champ de mars .",1
we also like walking and approaching it from different directions to get additional perspectives .,1
"during the day it 's very pretty , but at night , when the lights are on ... it 's simply magical !",1
an obvious must-see in paris .,1
you must go up to the summit floor of the tower to view the city and it beauty .,1
"its a must see when in paris , after all its the symbol for paris .",1
"the eiffel tower is a constant presence as you move around paris , so it is very compelling .",1
it would be sacrilege not to !,1
rather cold and windy at the top but fortunately there is a closed in floor immediately below so you can take in the views without facing the elements .,1
the tower is an amazing sight to see .,1
the lineup was quite long so i would advise you to purchase ticket in advance .,1
the tower is huge and incredible once you get up close .,1
stood in queue for 25 mins only for sth tower .,1
we scheduled a behind the scenes tour because presale tickets were sold out weeks in advance .,1
"visited the eiffel on my birthday , which is on christmas - it was a semi-clear day -lrb- a little overcast -rrb- but the views were amazing .",1
lines can be long if you have not been able to prebook the online tickets .,1
"we have been here many times , including once where we took 65 people to dinner at one of the restaurants inside the tower .",1
bring something warm as the wind does whip up and can be very cold .,1
by having no high-rise around it your sense of anticipation is heightened as you approach .,1
the experience must be endured once .,1
my family and i have just returned from a sight-seeing trip in paris .,1
"do it , you wo n't regret it .",1
i now know why people come back again and again .,1
the queue was long but we did expect that .,1
of course go .,1
"as one of the most recognizable engineering structures in the world , one can not truly grasp how massive this tower until he or she sees it in person .",1
tickets are available just to the 2nd level also .,1
it was much less crowded and you get a great night time view of paris .,1
"when i have been there first time , i began a cry ... it is totaly fantastic view , you arelike in some faytale ...",1
should be take the elevator for top level viewpoint .,1
tour included entry to 2nd level of eiffel tower and priority access as for tour groups - this is a huge benefit as lines are always extremely long .,1
an amazing engineering feat be inspired to look at the base and admire the engineering design .,1
listen to the rick steves podcast on the inception of the tower and its little quirks .,1
"it was like 7 euros for students to go to the 2nd level and that was a great experience , especially because there was n't a line at that time of night .",1
"i recommend walking by and under the structure , but seeing views from other places in the city .",1
the highlight of our paris weekend .,1
a good time to ascend the tower is shortly before twilight .,1
ok the queues are horrible -lrb- but if you 're willing to walk up to 2nd floor q for tickets is much less -rrb- .,1
"we walked through and around , and did a lot of people watching .",1
there is no option : la tour eiffel is a `` must do in paris '' !,1
"they open up tickets for sale at 8:30 am france time a month or so ahead ... meaning if you are like i was , i had to wait till 11:30 pm pacific time to order my tickets .",1
visited the eiffel tower with my 5 year old son so opted for the lift .,1
"i tried to get out of it by saying the views were nice from here and the queue for the extra ticket too long but my son , rightly , insisted we go to the top !",1
it is lovely day or night .,1
eiffel tower was one of the many high lights for our trip to paris and france .,1
we wanted to avoid the long queue for the lift and we made it to the first stage .,1
"when you do go , plan on waiting for the twinkling of the lights which happens every hour on the hour !",1
since i was a kid i have seen the eiffel tower silhouette and never had the chance to visit it .,1
a great way to start in paris .,1
great views of paris even on a rainy day,1
"the tower is the tallest structure in paris , at 1,063 ft , it has 3 levels and 9 elevators .",1
"make time for the queues thought , always very busy .",1
it took me 4 hours - on the queue and getting to the base .,1
"however , if you can book this without the need of going to viator.com then i strongly recommend you do .",1
if your going to go up the tower you definitely need to pay the extra & buy your tickets to skip the line or you can spend hours standing in line .,1
we went down with the lift without any waiting .,1
i strongly recommend the stairs ... healthy and the effort makes the view even more super .,1
"i had planned to go to the top , but on the day it was cloudy and hazy .",1
simply breathtaking .,1
"oddly i was only able to take the lift up , but there was no one restricting you from taking the stairs down !",1
every hour after 7.00 pm for 5 minutes it starts the glittering lights as if its shining in gold .,1
eiffel is a sembolic statue as most of knows .,1
not overrated at all !,1
great value and it is worth to note that e.u. citizens under 25 get a discount on tickets with valid id e.g. passport .,1
"it was my second time to paris but i really wanted our girls to go up the eiffel tower , it 's all they wanted to do while in the city !",1
"we took a tour that included dinner in the 58 restaurant , food was ok , but the view is really amazing !",1
wo n't be bothering again .,1
it 's an amazing structure .,1
"however , there are a few things you can do to make it extremely memorable !",1
but how to get there was so difficult in terms of parking lots .,1
"i must say , it did not disappoint !",1
it was very awe-inspiring to look at this gargantuan skeleton of what i 'm sure will be an incredible finished product one day .,1
"did not go up the elevator , but the side alone ... needs no further introduction .",1
especially those girls who ask you to sign some kind of petition .,1
do romantic with my husband !,1
i corrected him on this and he gave it back .,1
"later , i toured the eiffel tower by night to catch the light show on the hour -lrb- 11 pm -rrb- .",1
at night stay near the trocadero plaza for the best seats for the street entertainment before the tower show,1
"it gets super windy on top of the eiffel tower which can be very cool , actually , so wear the right cloths !",1
"but for a night view , consider to have a river cruise for a view from a changing distance and angle .",1
"but sadly , because of terrorist attacks , in order to have this experience , you must get in a huge line , go through security , and have your bags checked .",1
a little disappointed the fountains werent working this time as the are a fascinating spectacle .,1
lift to first level was n't too bad and we spent about half and hour admiring the views .,1
pictures do not do it justice .,1
"we have never seen the viewing areas around it so littered , abused , over run with people buying and selling junk and wine and beer - disgusting !!!!",1
"did n't go to the top , just the second floor .",1
this really is the no1 thing to see in paris !!,1
"as the sun sets and the eiffel tower is lit , the glory just shines even brighter .",1
reaching to the top is just an amazing feeling .,1
the views here are amazing !,1
"gorgeous , lovely and spectacular .",1
"buy your tickets online , starting three months in advance , to join shorter entrance and security queues .",1
we then decided to walk back down the stairs o admire the view and this magnificent structure .,1
to get under the eiffel tower you must go through a security checkpoint .,1
was part of a tour so did n't have to experience the wait in lines .,1
tourist trap .,1
"the eiffel tower , what more can be said !",1
it was very quiet then .,1
enjoy the amazing view !,1
"once on that line , we were under cover and straight into the elevator to the top .",1
$ 7 for adults and $ 5 for students -lrb- arc de triomphe where you have to walk up narrow uneven stairs is $ 12 ... -rrb- .,1
what a relax !,1
it was the tallest tower in the world at the time of its construction and has been imitated in various places around the world .,1
"you might ask yourself , , , why does this structure amaze so many ?",1
there is a line to enter into the `` cage '' that rides you up to the first level .,1
beware of the souvenir sellers in and around .,1
"a few years ago we visited the tower at night , and went up ... such a spectacular view , and when the lights come on , the show is outstanding .",1
"the view from on top is quite amazing , giving you vantage over all of paris .",1
we didnt go on the tower with our little one .,1
there was no people crowding out views or experience .,1
a memorable experience that i would highly recommend !,1
"well our group decided to do an afternoon trip up the eiffel tower , we got the passes that allow you to go in as a group and not have to line up to get in .",1
gracefully aging lady now some 127 years old who was only intended to live for 20 years before being removed but radio saved her and her tactical importance became the key to her survival .,1
if you are in any way a little squeamish about heights do not attempt the summit .,1
i need to bring my wife and kids to this enchanted place .,1
"only thing is tourists need to be aware of scams , pickpockets , ... .",1
top tip make sure your fed and watered while going here as the food kiosks at the bottom are daylight robbery with little choice for a decent snack,1
prebook otherwise you could wait a long time to get in we had champagne at the top which was bonus a must do trip .,1
my boyfriend spent 10 only .,1
architectural genius .,1
i personally thought it was one of the highlights of our quick tour in france - not to be missed.we parked across from the eiffel tower and watched boats travellinmg up and down the seine - with their own lights on as well .,1
this was such a pretty sight and i would definitely recommend it if you have the chance !,1
its also very usually packed so avoid going during peak seasons and keep your belongings close !,1
"wonderful experience , though it was a bad weather we took a chance and bought tickets to the top of the tower .",1
"the tower is remarkable in how is was made , and frames the paris skyline .",1
"there are not that many steps , the lines are much shorter and the views are amazing .",1
"dependant on your time there are many other sights to see but be warned , everywhere you go you will be searched twice .",1
we visited the tower every day and also at night as it was close to our hotel .,1
a must for every traveller that first visits paris .,1
the eiffel is more beautiful and grand in person than it is in any picture or video .,1
"very long queues here , and in the cold was not very comfortable .",1
came here twice .,1
would definitely recommend pre-booking tickets to get to the summit as the queues are a nightmare .,1
words ca n't explain how amazing it is in person .,1
we had a srcurity body scan check and bag check .,1
i do not enter a room without it and never leave home carrying more than i need,1
all four legs of the tower had lines that doubled-back on themselves .,1
"it is beautiful , and pretty much a must-see if you 're ever in paris , but going during the day is expensive , exhausting , and annoying .",1
thank you !,1
"we went up in the lift , then walked down the stairs .",1
"it was easy , took this 60-year-old less time than the wait did , and i rested often .",1
the city of lights all lit up .,1
go to the 3rd level .,1
reach early morning to be ahead of the large que .,1
this time had dinner at the exotic restaurant le jules verne which is accessible by a private lift .,1
always thought that my photographs should include the eiffel tower so visited the nearby montparnasse tower to complete that task .,1
we went to the eiffel tower at night .,1
"the staff are very efficient and although there were large numbers of people , the line moved along quickly .",1
not a lot can be said here this place is simply majestic just be aware of pickpockets and scammers .,1
fantastic attraction but book your tickets on line as the queuing is quite bad and no seats for disabled .,1
however to me it is the most impressive of the worlds tallest structures due to its unique nature .,1
"toilets available , plus refreshments .",1
easily the best thing we did in paris -lrb- aside from eat -rrb- .,1
"beautiful views of paris from up here , so recommend gon na up during the day , but walking round it at night .",1
all in all it was quite an experience .,1
you can not come to paris without visiting this place !,1
it was around 7:00 pm and surprisingly the lines were n't too bad when we finally made it there .,1
"it is crowded , loud , loaded with tourists but does take your breath away every time you see it !",1
the area around the eiffel tower is great with so much to do and see and many tourist services depart from this area like bus tours and river boats .,1
"leave plenty of time for this attraction - we had to wait in a couple of queues , but it was well worth it .",1
it 's highly recommended to buy ticket before you go there because there is long queue and dissuade to visit the eiffel tower,1
at times almost impossible to walk .,1
go - drink champagne .,1
you do n't have to go all the way to the top to appreciate the grandeur of this monument .,1
this is a very obvious one .,1
just be prepared to queue for about 2hrs !!!,1
it 's a must-do !,1
just ignore them but do n't let them con you into filling out a survey .,1
the queue 's are ridiculous and can get really long .,1
ok so we missed pre booking tickets .,1
"so , no need to pay extra to go all the way to the top .",1
we happened to be at the tower at 11.30 pm .,1
"take plenty of time to take in the views , but not while waiting in line or climbing .",1
otherwise you 'll be jostling for space amidst elbows and selfie sticks .,1
all the art museums and galleries !,1
"once up its a marvelous view , do make sure to come early , since you need to stand in line .",1
"when we arrived the top of the tower was close down , but opened as we queued .",1
it is should be a must on any first-time trip to paris,1
when you arrive under the tower and see the actual size of it is when you believe you 're actually in paris .,1
very disappointed to see the amount of rubbish in the gardens surrounding the eiffel tower .,1
there are a lot of things to do .,1
i would recommend the eiffel tower tour .,1
lots and lots of tourists but the experience is well worth it .,1
c'est magnifique !!,1
great fun but go to a skip the line tour because it is really crowded and there are two checkpoints .,1
"i bought our tickets in advance with skip the line and guide included , that would be my recommendation to avoid the long lines .",1
"this was much more crowded -lrb- everyone gets a ticket to the middle , less buy tickets to the summit -rrb- .",1
there is now a fence around it & security check point to go through but that is fine & does n't take long to go through .,1
it was crowded but we had prepurchased tickets directly thru the eiffel tower website .,1
we went all the way to the top !,1
"take your time , enjoy the view and enjoy a crepe before you go in .",1
"there is also a chance that the the ticket to the summit might be sold out , but you can just book the ticket for second level and then buy ticket to the summit at the second level .",1
the view of the city from the top is one i will never forget & the view of the tower as it sparkles on the hour after dark is something that still makes me happy even up to today .,1
we have taken tickets till top floor of eiffel tower .,1
wanted to eat at the first level restaurant but this only seemed possible if you booked a trip up the tower and did it in advance,1
there is only 1 eiffel tower in the world and it does n't disappoint .,1
the price you pay for the ticket is worth every cent as you take in the view of the whole of paris .,1
it turns out that they sell lots of tickets on site .,1
take the sightseeing tour bus instead of taxis .,1
it 's was a wonderful experience .,1
completely exhilarating and memorable !,1
unbelievable views !,1
"january , cool , windy , rain off and on but no line ups , security less than 5 mins , tickets , less than 5 mins , we are on the next elevator up and at times had the whole level to ourselves .",1
"do not buy any tickets online to save waiting , as you will be waiting anyway for security reasons .",1
it 's a shame if you go only to the second level .,1
go to trocadero metro station if you 're going - you get the best views from the station and some great photo ops,1
the light display and the city lights are spectacular .,1
so in short one can visit this place any time and still be amazed and mesmerised by its beauty .,1
nice view of paris you never get tired of being there but you get tired of the very slaw long lines to get to buy your tickets and then getting to the elevators .,1
once upstairs we waited for another half hour .,1
the eiffel tower is an icon and deservedly so .,1
be aware of cold wind in the open terrace .,1
there was like a street fair or some such going on that had food vendors and holiday decorations .,1
the view from the top is breathtaking and worth every penny,1
"expect a lot of young , pushy girls trying to pose for glamour shots .",1
we paid for a tour which included a meal on the first floor of the eiffel tower .,1
we just walked around the tower and in the park .,1
like us you can focus on the fun part of your trip with a priority access to the eiffel tower .,1
go to the top and i recommend the champagne bar when you get there !,1
we built up the kids excitement about eiffel tower since before we arrived to paris .,1
"its everywhere , at every street corner , in every shop , in your mind , in your pictures .",1
shocked at her answer we planned ahead .,1
"a must do when visiting paris , the views are amazing , go right to the top if you do n't mind heights !!",1
my daughter who is 9 simply loved it and enjoyed the unobstructed views of paris .,1
i liked it better after sunset .,1
we booked our tickets ahead of time since we wanted to go to the top .,1
"it is breathtaking to see it up close and realize you are really in paris , standing at the base of the eiffel tower .",1
we went on a cloudy day,1
really enjoyed the trip to the tower .,1
this was the most touristy place we visited in paris .,1
it was fairly crowded everywhere while we were there and we left around 1030pm .,1
the view from the tower this great you can see for miles and you can get so great pictures from it .,1
"small queues , especially at the access via stairs -lrb- which we took based on cost saving and to work off the giant meringues enjoyed earlier -rrb- .",1
the eiffel tower is a must in paris .,1
we contemplated making reservations for lunch at the restaurant here .,1
"iconic , perhaps the only ca n't - miss site in paris .",1
it is lit with beautiful lights at night .,1
fun for the whole family .,1
the place is magical .,1

you could also just sit by the seine and enjoy dinner while the light slowly fades - at least in may !,1
its a really dreamy place .,1
there 's too many people inthe tower and all around .,1
we went here as i wanted to propose to my fiance i 'd already bought tickets on line i had arranged a meal with 24 red roses & also arranged 3 staff members to sing every thing went to plane staff were brilliant we stayed for 3 hours went to the top amazing views we followed this then by a night trip on the river boat it 's a must to see the tower lite up is totally amazing we were only approach once as a guy wanted to draw us but i said no & he left us alone would i go go again deffinatly,1
not to stand in long queues should buy tickets in advance over the internet .,1
"is just trying to distract you so her colleague can pick your pocket , the souvenir sellers are aggressive , following you for a sale .",1

"however , in your way will be 2 long waits at the elevators .",1
"it is so large , so intricate and so interesting that it will amaze even the most blasé traveler .",1
"we accessed at the most high point of the tower at night , the view was interesting .",1
the most dramatic review is from the trocadero across the seine from the tower as it is quite elevated .,1
"only downside are the queues , we bought an ` all-in ' tourist ticket from the information centre , but the girl forgot to sell us our ticket to the tower , hence we ended up in a very long queue for over an hour ... and that was quiet .",1
at $ 11 's not a bad price .,1
"seen her so many times now , but she remains my go-to whenever i 'm in paris .",1
if you are new to paris and are unsure of the best way to get around check out the hop on hop off buses but beware .,1
there was lots to do and see while at the eiffel tower .,1
simply marvellous .,1
the only bad part of the people trying to sell to you illegally .,1
the place itself was gorgeous to look at .,1
on a clear day you can see for miles and miles and pick out most of the landmarks around paris .,1

it did n't dampen our excitement at all .,1
be warned there are a lot of people in the area .,1
"no trip to paris -lrb- for first timers -rrb- would be complete without a visit , but i probably could have enjoyed just as much without going up .",1

you can even ice skate this december on the first level .,1
"once you fight through the crowds , and the street sellers , and the con artists wanting your details - this is truely one of the most magical moments of my holiday .",1
never took a night tour of paris until now .,1
a must-see .,1
when we reached the second floor .,1
"though it is crowded and may seem over rated when you wait for the tickets , definitely a must visit .",1
i 'd advice you walk from trocadero as this provides a very nice view with the fountains .,1
for us it was the end of the day -- everyone was cranky and tired so we did the best we could right there .,1
this is quite simply one of those things you have to see up close and personal - by night .,1
"if you are able to , either buy timed lift tickets about 3 months in advance or climb the stairs .",1
not that we planned on drinking up there !,1
go to the trubador that overlooks the tower at night to see a spectacular light show on the hour .,1
"you 've seen it in photos but nothing can prepare you for when you 're standing in front of it , beneath it or atop it .",1
if you have done it before dont do it again fine something else to do in paris :-rrb- on a side note at night every hour on the hour for 5 mins the tower lights up and does a kind of twinkle light show .,1
another tick on the bucket list of places me and the hubby would like to visit .,1
definitely recommend purchasing the advance tickets in order to avoid the immense lines !,1
"main monument of paris , around there are gardens where every one can play games , sleep or read a book .",1
restaurants are good but can get very busy .,1
"as you go up you 'll see the iconic paris transforming to the city of light right before your eyes , which is amazingly breathtaking !",1
the panoramic view was amazing .,1
large police presence - feels very safe .,1
my family rode the lift to the summit and said that the views were terrific as well .,1
"well ... , yes it is !",1

it 's a wonderful ` free ' view too !!!,1
"we got in line at about 8pm ... i have to admit , i almost gave up after an hour of advancing inch by inch to the ticket window .",1
first let me say that the eiffel tower is spellbinding at night .,1
we last visited the eiffel tower in 1988 .,1
i heard that they are going to put glass around instead so that will eventually look nicer .,1
"beautiful day and night , sadly now be prepared for excess security line !",1
the iconic eiffel tower is amazing and you must go to the top while in paris !,1
the views from the top are great and are even better on a sunny day .,1
an icon in paris definetly .,1
there are great views of the tower from several different vantage points so do n't just take photos up close .,1
it was the most amazing experience and the food was superb .,1
we always head to trocadero to see the eiffel tower ... especially when timed to see the sparkling lights in the evening .,1
new years under the eiffel tower .,1
lots of folks selling trinkets in this area .,1
we you know the history your ca n't really believe it got built .,1
i have longed to see the eiffel tower my entire life .,1
"it is both larger , and smaller at the same time somehow .",1
there are coffee shops and gift shops .,1
i try to stay away from tourist traps so i did not eat near the tower .,1
by the time we came down at 11.15 the lines were enormous .,1
"awesome architecture , one of a kind place .",1
it was fun to take pictures of from various angles and viewpoints from around the city .,1
really interesting .,1
very magical & romantic we did n't go up it but did venture underneath it .,1
a `` must do '' when in paris .,1
an amazing view !,1
it 's one of those places you must-see when in paris and for a good reason .,1
many people were there so to take a photo was so difficult .,1
this was such an amazing experience .,1
although i 'm petrified of heights and had to pull myself together a bit it was absolutely worth it .,1
you can hop on and off any time and catch up the next boat in 20 mins or so .,1
remember your umbrella .,1
"we reserved our tickets in advance , and had a specific time to show up ... but then there was the security line , and then there was the line for the first elevator , and then the line for the elevator to go to the top , and the the crowds of people all jostling to get a view , and then the repeat lines to try to go back down .",1
we then joined the line to go up the tower which took about 30 minutes .,1
so beautiful day and night .,1
it was an absolutely glorious day when we were there and the views were spectacular .,1
however we didnt go up it as the que was ridiculously big .,1
i did n't bother going up into the tower for these reasons and because i was on a tight budget and heard it was expensive .,1
we then went down to the lower levels and eventually made our way all the way down .,1
i was so excited to visit .,1
highly recommend going up to the summit .,1
night time show is worth seeing .,1
you can climb up to with 7 euro fee or you can pay 14 euro to take an elevator to the observation deck where you can the view of paris .,1
"the shopping is great , the food is incredible and you feel like you never want to leave .",1
"we took elevator to the top , and we got down by the stairs .",1
"i get that people are messy , but that just means a city needs to work harder to keep up with it !",1
it cheap to enter and the views are stunning .,1
maybe took us 20 minutes .,1
"the champagne bar was open , which capped off our visit .",1
if you are amaze of the eiffel tower on daytime .,1
no queues and straight up to 2nd floor .,1
the tower is now understandably surround by temporary fencing with an army presence which distracts from the usual beauty of the area .,1
it looks exactly the same today - except for the cute lcd twinkle at 11 p.m. central european summer time .,1
there is nothing that can take away from the beauty of the view of the eiffel tower .,1
it 's located in a place where it 's easy to just walk around and enjoy people and the sights .,1
we used to travel shop on bourdonnais .,1
"if you have tickets already , get there with plenty of time to spare because security can take a while - they do n't explain that you need to empty water bottles , etc. .",1
you can purchase your euro cup merchandise as well .,1
we rode the elevator and took the stairs to visit all the levels .,1
every hour it sparkles with lights at night and is fabulous .,1
"any trip to paris must include the eiffel tower during the day or night , an iconic landmark in a cosmopolitan city in a fantastic place in the world in which we live .",1
it was a bit underwhelming .,1
fairly crowded when waiting for lifts but the lines seem to move smoothly enough and it is certainly worth the wait !,1
the observation deck 1/2 way up has great views and some great little stores inside .,1
from middle floor down .,1
every hawker from around the world will offer you their items - adds colour but ... .,1
also the elevator that goes from mid level to the top of the tower is also crowded .,1
i 'm still kicking myself that i did not buy a small eiffel tower to take home .,1
and i have to say you have to see it to believe it and for the grandeur to sink in !!!,1
2nd level was plenty high for me !,1
enjoy the perspective from the bottom .,1
we took the lift right to the top and the views are to die for !!,1
the tower is easy enough to explore on your own .,1
"instead we enjoyed people watching , including a couple having wedding photos of the bride taken with the eiffel tower in the background .",1
"long queues , but it is worth the hustle .",1
the tower is amazing and much larger than you think .,1
"the walk to eiffel tour is short , but one could enjoy the view .",1
expected long queues but bought the ticket and was up within 20 minutes !,1
nevertheless if you have never done it it is worth doing it -lrb- once -rrb-,1
do take the elevator .,1
"watch out for scammers and pick pockets in the grounds , we were approached by a lady doing a `` questionnaire '' for disabled children and felt rude walking away ignoring her but our guide explained afterwards that the ploy is to keep you listening whilst checking out your pockets !!",1
since we were taking our two kids to paris for the first time this was high on their list .,1
"only went to 2nd level , really wished i went to the top !",1
it seemed slightly shabby and tired ... .,1
get your tickets in advance .,1
it is truly a engineering marvel .,1
there are lots of tips and tricks to visiting which can be found on other sites - one of our favorite ways to see this part of paris is to grab some yummy snacks from rue cler and snag a bench with a view of the tower and the tourists .,1
this is probably the world 's most recognizable structure .,1
"the adjacent park would be nice , but it 's not maintained well and is full of annoying sellers of trinkets .",1
"i visited again during the day the next day , it was still glorious but not as much as it was in the night .",1
skip the long queues by going there as early as you can and not on a weekend .,1
bring a blanket and lunch and you can totally have a romantic afternoon there .,1
"it 's fabulous , very clean city food is very nice lovely city nice coffee shops visit as possible historical buildings too",1
"though i would recommend visiting during the summer -lrb- though beware of long queues -rrb- , because when i visited it was bitter cold on the second level and the top was closed .",1
no queuing which was great .,1
"indeed , the moment you land in paris , only thing in your mind remains is to go there .",1
"highly recommend you buy skip-the-line tickets -lrb- i bought them from viator , through tripadvisor -rrb- - this will save you hours of standing in line .",1
next time would take the time to walk up or go on our own as the .,1
"we have done the tour in winter 2016 -lrb- january -rrb- , and it took us one hour to reach the elevators to take us up to the second floor , there are amazing souvenirs sold in the boutique shops if your willing to get some as gifts or even as a reminder of your trip experience .",1
this tower sparkles for 5 minutes every hour .,1
worth seeing both day and night time .,1
at that time i went to the top and took in all the sites .,1
- our first glimpse of the tower from the river was wonderful .,1
"it is a massive super structure that you can ride to the top and overlook the beautiful city , go at night and see why they call paris the city of lights .",1
"the terrorists did not keep people locked away inside -- people were walking around , enjoying the sights .",1
we arrived 30 minutes before opening and had virtually no wait once lines opened .,1
"the best city pictures are taken at the 2nd level , which is still high up .",1
visit multiple times a year .,1
on the way down we stopped at the visitor area where there where souvenir shops and a restaurant .,1
we got skip the line tickets from get your guide and it was totally worth it .,1
it 's definitely number one for tourists .,1
totally a must see - but expect lots and lots of people and crowds .,1
"i 've thought that the eiffel tower was a tourist attraction overrated , but it is n't !",1
"wear layers , it gets cold up their especially late evening .",1
i had read review about it prior to my visit and i decided that we would not go to the top .,1
not recommended to those that are afraid of heights,1
enjoy a picnic in the park .,1
took the lift to the top and was rewarded with a 360 degree view of paris .,1
"the opening was delayed with no specified time for opening , so we considered leaving , but stayed and they opened at 10:30 instead of 9:30 .",1
definitely see the tower at night .,1
it 's nicely lit and if you 're lucky enough to be there at midnight the lights do a little dance for you :-rrb- we were only able to walk into the second floor as the lift was out of use and there are no stairs to the top .,1
it was a chocolate cake with the eiffel tower design .,1
the tower itself is an interesting piece of work to view .,1
going to the second level is fine .,1
booked in advance with viatour skip the line .,1
the ticketing system appears as old as the tower surely in the smartphone / it era it could be improved on site ?,1
a must while in paris .,1
when in paris you must try and go up the tower .,1
"in addition it is also worth paying attention to the waiting time from the 2nd floor to the top , that is displayed on the electronic information boards that are clearly visible from the queues .",1
it 's amazing seeing this famous french symbol in person !,1
this was so irritating !,1
the lines will be long but they move rather quickly .,1
"it is one of the most visited attractions , make sure you get your tickets online to avoid wasting your valuable time in queue",1
stunning view of the city .,1
i do n't know what else to say that the other reviews have not .,1
"the eiffel tower up close is very impressive & grand , especially at night when it 's all lit up .",1
"visiting at the top of the hour beginning at 9 pm , there is a 5 minute light show .",1
or drive next to it during the day and enjoy the marvels,1
we come to paris 3 times in the last 3 years .,1
so go prepared with information .,1
jmj just because you can see it does n't mean you are nearby all the time .,1
we only went to level 2 but it was plenty high enough .,1
"i have seen some people recommend to not go to the summit/3rd floor , however i felt it was an incredible experience to go up to the top and see across the entire city .",1
we visited the tower on our 1st night and it is a brilliant specticle when lit and made for some great photos .,1
definately has to be seen .,1
the views of paris are fantastic but even in january it is incredibly busy up there .,1
"visit eiffel tower once if you could in your lifetime , a magic place for its glory .",1
"this was definitely the most iconic place to visit in paris , though we did not actually go into the towel due to limited time we had , and long queues regarding security check and tickets .",1
"i booked tickets in advance , with a 1530 slot to be up there for sunset .",1
"it is impressive by day but when it 's all lit up it is magical , especially on the hour when it twinkles !",1
definitely visit at night if you can .,1
try to be in groups if traveling at late hours of night .,1
went to the top and decided to walk back down from the first level .,1
i used the stairs to 1st floor and after took the lift .,1
i used to think the tower was cheesy and over rated ... until i went !,1
"all in all , a free , magnificent structue and probably the place you would never like to miss during your stay in paris !",1
"it was such a beautiful view , underneath is the seine river with ferry boat and i can see notre dame catheral , the louve , and even sacre coeur bacilica from the distant .",1
we tried but they were only offered from mid-november .,1
"in the evening there are some exhibitions closed , than the 1,5-2 hours are the minimum .",1
"when you 've said `` no thanks '' once , you 'll end up saying it 100 times !",1
well of course going to paris and does n't go to eiffel tower should n't happen !,1
i went all the way to top with my kids and it was a journey to remember .,1
there are a few eating options and souvenirs and i imagine it would be pricier than average .,1
"after going through security , we made our way to the ticket counter & within 15 minutes had our tickets -lrb- 11 euro each -rrb- & lined up for the elevator for the second level .",1
every one must see eiffel tower before he/she die !,1
pre booking is advisable as its such a popular attraction .,1
"the eiffel tower is a must see while in paris , even if you do not go up it is like the statue of liberty in the us",1

excellent english and was able to answer all my questions .,1
what a way to see the city of lights !,1
"you can take an elevator all the way to the top , yet if you are feeling more sporty you can climb about halfway with a staircase and then take the elevator to the top .",1
there were 320 steps to the first level .,1
that now means going back through security check to get back on the grounds there was a restroom on the second level of the tower but we were not permitted to go in until 2 o'clock .,1
"go during the day , go at night .",1
"no problems here , the staff do their job as quickly as they can .",1
looked dire .,1

"when you consider that the eiffel tower was originally designed to be a temporary structure over 140 years ago , and is still standing , with thousands of visitors catered to every day of the week , you know it must be an incredible feat of engineering to be still standing .",1
it was really enjoyable to sip cappuccino at windy 17 ° c and a view at the tower .,1

the line at mid afternoon was about an hour long .,1

paris is such an easy city to walk around and so small really so its worth while getting your brings before you set off .,1
queue to get in was mental at around 5.30 pm on a friday evening -lrb- well over 30 mins standing in biting winds and freezing temperatures but it was well worth it and it didnt feel particularly crowded inside .,1
"the only problem was the queueing and how busy the top of the tower was , but we had anticipated that people would flock to see it !",1

took a bike and saw almost everything of this amazing city .,1
not sure if indeed it was -lrb- or was not -rrb- a slightly shorter line .,1
you can see all paris from there and it so romantic for a couples l .,1
"still lots and lots of tourists , but a completely different atmosphere .",1
at night it is like a life as been woken .,1
"it 's beautiful , just like everything else in paris , and you have to see it .",1
not for those afraid of heights .,1
"when in paris , the eiffel tower is a must see .",1
during nights one can sit for long time in the park seeing the beauty of the tower in lights.it was getting quite cold during nights even in july end so better to carry some light jackets .,1
this is an experience like no other .,1
the queues were as expected -lrb- it was saturday -rrb- but they move reasonably quickly .,1
i 've been going to france for 30 years .,1
magnificently grandiose work of engineers eiffel .,1
"amazing structure but its not it , but its about you and your partner .",1
endure the lines -lrb- shorter at night -rrb- and go up to one of the observation decks for a spectacular view of paris .,1
definitely try to book tickets ahead of time to avoid the line -lrb- at least get tickets to the second floor -rrb- .,1
i always wonder why people are so attracted to the eiffeltower .,1
"also they have a new part on one of the levels were there is a section of glass which you can stand on and see the people walk underneath , it is pretty cool .",1
it was one of our first stops when we got to paris .,1
"yes it was pricey , but worth it to say you had been .",1

"well worth a visit to the `` sumit '' , we got some amazing photos and a great experience .",1
afterwards we had a long stair climb .,1
the tower is world famous for a reason !,1
you can go by elevator or steps,1
"booking in advance is virtually impossible , so be prepared to queue !",1
"if you have the time to visit the eiffe tower , i 'd recommend it ; however if you are too short on time perhaps another site may be more worthy of your time .",1

"it 's worth seeing in any condition -lrb- other than dense fog -rrb- day or night , whether you walk around it on the ground or climb the stairs or take an elevator .",1
the beauty of the tower is to be seen to be believed .,1
long queues ?,1
the lines to go down on the elevator were way longer than the ticket line so we ended up walking down from the 1st level to ground which actually took forever but was pleasant -- interesting views and we were the only ones in the stairway .,1
one of the best meals of our trip !,1
"since our last visit in 2009 , they have installed security entrances around the base of the monument .",1
"in todays world , it is an unfortunate change , but it increased the feeling of security .",1
"we visited both at night and during the day , you queue to get through security then again to buy tickets be careful which queue you join some are for stairs some are for the lifts , either way you have to queue again to pay more money to go to the top , in other words most of your time will be spent queuing !!!",1
great place for a picnic and not overcrowded like i expected .,1
"though taking the lift up , and the height , is scary , it is definitely worth it .",1
"when we were finally on the top floor , the sky was getting dark .",1
it is very very nice to see it in real .,1
"went the evening of 24 feb with my family -lrb- 2 children , ages 8 and 6 align with my parents -rrb- .",1
"if you do go in daytime , go as early as you can .",1
ours was very quick and involved maybe 20 minutes of waiting total for all of the various elevators .,1
watch at night for the twinkling lights on the eiffel tower that go for every 30 minutes .,1
the special place foe proposles ... amazing .,1
do n't forget to explore the park as well .,1
"a truly mesmerising and amazing work of art , architecture and engineering .",1
both day and night views are fantastic .,1
it would be advisable to pre-book your ticket online to avoid the queue .,1
being my first time i had images in my mind about this eiffel icon !,1

river siene is a the real beauty,1
i always make it a point to see the eiffel tower when i visit paris .,1
very nice place .,1
"we went there on our honeymoon , and did not regret it .",1
i am very glad to visit paris .,1
"if nothing else walk around the grounds , if not long lines the views from the top is breathtaking .",1
"it is true , there are a lot of people .",1
it made me feel a little uneasy at times .,1
go late in the day after the crowds thin .,1
it fills the skyline and is dramatic in the distance .,1
it was n't crowded when we went .,1
tres bon !,1
when illuminated its like magic .,1
mwe were left at the tower and will now go back solo for the boat tours not waht i anticipated at all .,1
we understand the recent serious incidents in france have caused a heightened sense of security .,1
i think i got a student discount which was fairly substantial but i ca n't remember .,1
i enjoyed the view more at night personally but thats just me .,1
this monument could be viewed elegantly from the boat on seine river or from rooftop of montparnasse building .,1
a bit disappointed .,1
we had dinner at one of the restaurants .,1
we both spent quality time in the evening !,1
5 minutes later we were riding up to the second level .,1
we were very disappointed .,1
even decided to sip on champagne while we were there .,1
i have seen eiffel tower in pictures before but the view in real is million times breath taking .,1
"we went to the very top , which was a bit unsettling , but a must for a once in a lifetime experience !",1
dominating the skyline it has to be one of the places for any visitor to paris .,1
"there it is no matter where you go within the city , and at night it gleams on the horizon .",1
hang around till ten and watch the light show !,1
since childhood i dreamt of seeing the eiffel atleast once .,1
one downside is the number of people hawking souvenirs and other junk outside the entry lines .,1
unforgetable experience .,1
book restaurant saves time queuing .,1
the tower looked spectacular from our hotel room and lived up to its immense stature when we went to the very top of it .,1
the tower looks great in day and night .,1
we decided to take the lift to the second level and walk down .,1
come from the trocadero metro for a better first view .,1
the cons are the long lines for the tickets and elevators and the dodgy pedlers pushing their paris wares .,1
lots of individuals selling souvenirs ...,1
i have to admit that the views of paris from the 2nd floor were breathtaking and i really enjoyed my trip up the tower .,1
the eiffel tower was my favorite thing i did while in paris !,1
"take time to walk through the adjacent park , watch the children play a pick-up game of soccer , or the older kids and parents play table tennis , or see the manually-powered children 's carousel .",1
march was lovely .,1
the view is terrific though there are many souvennier sellers around .,1
the eiffel tower is pretty impressive .,1
"it was packed even on a cold windy night with tourists and locals celebrating the day of love at this mammoth display of engineering , i am still fathoming the correlation .",1
"once we got up to the window , we were the last in line to get tickets to go all the way to the top .",1
"our tour guide -lrb- based in paris , so he knew the eiffel tower employees -rrb- walked right up to the elevator with our group and we got right on .",1
"paris looks amazing at night from the top of the eiffel tower , although i have a fear of heights i still managed to go all the way to the top .",1
"when we arrived in paris , we were excited as we passed by the eiffel tower and thrilled to go visit the next day .",1
the prices are reasonable and you wo n't regret making the effort .,1
"definitely a must see , regardless of time of day .",1
"you definitely must visit her at night , at 7pm , 8pm and 9pm -lrb- i think it was -rrb- she twinkles for 5 minutes !",1
have only been there during the day .,1
many food outlets & stores along the way .,1
walked right up with no line at all .,1
"it 's not every day you get to visit a place that is instantly recognised the world over , but that is what the eiffel tower is .",1
its beautiful at night .,1
i went up to the second floor of the tower during the day by going up the stairs .,1
"we were walking towards it through the neighborhood , after leaving the arc de triomphe and it just seemed to pop into view .",1
none the less the view from the top is amazing of what then seems like an origami city and it is worth seeing and going up because it is the eiffel tower and you ca n't do paris completely without it .,1
"the downside is that you have an allotted time , but the time you save is fantastic .",1
arrive early -lrb- not later than 10:00 -rrb- and you 'll probably avoid any queues .,1
i have been to the eiffel tower numerous times and it never gets old .,1
"fab view , lots of interesting history .",1
it really is a sight to see !,1
this was different though and a lot more fun .,1
we visited the eiffel tower in september on a lovely clear day .,1
reservations fill up early so as soon as they open the site for the dates you are looking for grab a time .,1
get there early in the day and go right to the top !,1
it is always better if you book the tickets in advance so you can avoid the queue there .,1
i 've seen the eiffel tower countless times .,1
"almost any time is a good time to visit , but the best time is at night which with its hourly sparkles that illuminate the skyline",1
seen by night and by day ... by far the best way to see it is all lit up at night .,1
exceptional view of paris as u go up .,1
"of course this place is amazing , it 's literally one of the most important french icons known around the world ... looks great from afar and close up , view is great and a good time out if you go but also see it at night as it shines and sparkles in the night light ... do not go to paris and miss this !",1
"do n't do that , just go on up , all the way .",1
a `` must '' if you 're in paris,1
it was worth the visit but it was overcrowded .,1
"the queues can belong , but it worth it , the views are stunning",1
thats why i even gave it an average.you have to see it .,1
3rd lift up main tower can be unnerving .,1
a must see when in paris ; especially beautiful at night .,1
great time-saver if the queues are long once you have a relative level of fitness as there seem to be an endless number of steps lol !,1
"buy a bottle of wine , pate , cheese & french bread and just sit in the champ de mars and take it all in ... enjoy !",1
walking up to the eiffel tower i was n't feeling very impressed but as we got closer it took my breath away .,1
we were asked to assemble at a meeting point in an open easy to find area not very far from the eiffel tower .,1
"try to avoid the lines , and be careful in the areas surrounding the tower .",1
there is no paris without eifferl tower .,1
but it gets very crowded and busy so suggest get there early .,1
we did have tickets and arrived in plenty of time to just sit and take in this magnificent structure from all angels .,1
it 's not high and you see more as you climb .,1
"we climed the steps and was only $ 4 each which is great value , -lrb- it 's more exspensive to buy a soft drink in paris than it is to climb the eiffel tower !! -rrb-",1
and on the hour after it 's dark the tower lights up with sparkling lights for a few minutes .,1
"oh , and you must see it at night .",1
the views are sensational .,1
"we went during the day , and the line was outrageous .",1
"the food is the best exceptional - will go there again , should the opportunity arise murray - australia",1
the most important place to visit in paris .,1
for most people the walk will be ok just take it slow .,1
"just do n't take any locks with you because the security will confiscate them , and choose a clear day/night for the optimal views from the top .",1
we spent about four hours on all the different floors .,1
"eiffel tower is a known icon for paris , france .",1
this was probably the most romantic place we went while in paris .,1
just beautiful and inspiring any time of year .,1
"it is a very suggestive place during the day , and an extremely romantic one during the night !",1
this is a must do .,1
it sparkled and was defintely romantic,1
we decided to take pictures during the day and come back at night when there are typically shorter or no lines .,1
"so if you ca n't see the views during the day , it 's so worth seeing at night !",1
try to work it so that you are there right at sunset if possible .,1
it really is a gorgeous view .,1
was closed to the public .,1
"i cant comment on actually going up , as we didnt bother doing this .",1
beware the hordes of tourists and the scammers they attract .,1
beware of scam artists and pickpockets .,1
-lrb- and bring a hat ... -rrb-,1
there will be at least a 40 minute wait in line if you do n't book your ticket up the tower online but i would strongly suggest getting a walk up ticket which a -rrb- has virtually no line up and b -rrb- makes it a much better experience if everyone in your party is able bodied .,1
felt bad that people have no respect for a place like this .,1
it is perfect couples very romantic .,1
just one of things that you need to see if you are in paris .,1
i did not go up the tower as the queue was really long and tickets to go up with the elevator can be bought online if you would like to skip the queue of people buying tickets .,1
"very easy to get there by metro , get off at trocadero statio n.",1
make sure to grab a glass of champagne from the champagne bar and celebrate !!,1
going up at night was so beautiful with all the lights on the tower and in the city .,1
it is fun to people-watch here .,1
simply awesome .,1
during the day we returned and walked around the tower to appreciate the intricacies of it .,1
"ofcourse the bathroom situation was terrible again , sorry to say .",1
i got into a tour bus and was so impressed on how big it was .,1
this is not the paris i visited year 1997 .,1
"ok , i 'm a last minute traveler and did n't have time to buy the eiffel tower summit tickets months in advance so i had to wait in line ... here 's my advice - do n't take the tour ... they only take you to the first level and everyone there said they felt scammed by the tours they paid for .",1
it 's worth because i can see the city of paris at the top of tower .,1
the views from this level is very nice and i do n't see any reason to spend the extra euros to go to the very top .,1
recommend visit in the day and especially at night - spectacular - you can get a lift to the top - food vendors are near the tower .,1
it lights and sparkles at night so it looks outstanding .,1
a most to do if there visiting .,1
the level of people looking to pick pocket you on the grounds is extremely uncomfortable .,1
we enjoyed a delicious meal with panoramic views and a glass of champagne at the top .,1
such a beautiful view at night there .,1
i enjoyed the area around the eiffel tower just as much as going to the top .,1
expect to wait about 3 hours .,1
we got up early which was the best opton we avoided all queues which was great we spent alot of time there because we did n't have to wait inline .,1
"whether you walk up to it for the photographic experience , or climb/take the elevator up to get incredible views , and learn about its structure , compare sizes to other monuments around the world , or want to gift-shop , the eiffel tower is a must-see attraction while in paris .",1
must-visit aorund 11pm when the tower glitters for a couple of minutes .,1
i was there in october at night .,1
"the elevators were crowded and had signs all over warning of pickpockets , but we had no trouble .",1
"we had lunch at the eiffel tower , and then had an evening ticket to go up to the summit , and it was one of the highlights of our entire trip to paris .",1
we walked around the tower and level one .,1
beware of pickpockets !,1
i have a bit of a fear of heights but there is high fencing around and also a viewing gallery .,1
to avoid crowds you may leave 5 minutes earlier than the total fireworks duration which is around 35 minutes .,1
we went near eiffel tower to see the phyro games .,1
yes it is beautiful !,1
learn to avoid them at all cost .,1
you need to have at least 3-4 hours to actually manage to go to the topfloor but the view will repay you !,1
all are one under this tower .,1
buy your tickets online to avoid the line .,1
the problem is the waiting times just to get in to buy tickets .,1
do n't waste time and money on the elevator .,1
"i was surprised to see signs warning people not to purchase souveniers from the hawkeers and also to see the amount of gypsies around with their various scams going on - saw a couple of young adults targeted and you feel like warning them as they were loosing money and did n't realise that the only ones winning anything were the accomplices , which you could pick out by just sitting back and watching who goes with who when the game is finished .",1
"we opted for the stairs because it 's cheaper , and honestly , i think it 's more fun .",1
amazing structure to visit and great levels of security for visitors due to the stories of pickpocking at this place .,1
please book your passes in advance if you are going during peak season or there is waiting time of at least 1 hour .,1
"we went to the summit first , and then down to the second level , then to the ground .",1
i still remember with great joy my visit to paris and climbing up the stairs of eiffel tower .,1
a visit to the eiffel tower is an absolute must when visiting paris .,1
this symbol of paris is even more awesome up close and in real time .,1
we take the old elevator to the summit and enjoyed breath taken view of paris .,1
"i definitely suggest picking your tickets up before hand as it will save quite a bit of time , you will not have to wait in the ticket line and can go directly to the bery short line for guests with tickets .",1
have a high quality camera .,1
i advise to avoid week-ends if you want to go up without waiting too long on the line .,1
it was amazing & well worth it .,1
"once that time came though , they let you straight through to the queue to go up the tower .",1
"the lift took us up to about half way , then we got out , had a look around at the lovely views , and had to queue up again to get another lift to the summit .",1
was breathtaking to see this !,1
after an excellent early dinner -lrb- 6.30 pm sitting -rrb- we then went up to the top of the tower for sun set .,1
17 $ to go to the summit .,1
i love the view during the night .,1
in february at the top it was snowing !,1
awesome views of the city .,1
"enjoy the huge mesmerizing gardens , stairs up to top is free but a enormous climb .",1
take in the views regardless of the weather .,1
well the events in paris in 2015 has not stopped the tourists flocking to this great city .,1
the iconic eiffel tower is on the list of every visitor to paris .,1
we had a skip the line pass from a tour we took that included lunch at the restaurant 58 .,1
returned the following day and the queues were short .,1
just magical .,1
we had pre-booked tickets for the first two floors from a company called ` fat tire tours ' which enabled us to avoid the 5-6 hour queue on the day which was a bonus when travelling with 2 children .,1
the ticketing was fast and easy and the tower was clean and the staff great .,1
the lines were long but we did n't feel that we had to wait too long .,1
although we were disappointed the observation was amazing .,1
a must see of course .,1
we booked dinner at the restaurant on the tower .,1
the use to stairs to the second level and then using the elevators to the top can save you sometime and can be nice experience -lrb- also your fitbit counter will love it -rrb- .,1
reasonable price for the stunning views at the top .,1
"when you get there you must show up at your reserved time , not any earlier .",1
yes we have now marvelled at the engineering structure .,1
there is a restaurant in the eiffel tower .,1
"absolutely stunning view , especially at night .",1
"at night , buy a stupid cheap bottle of wine from the vendors walking around -lrb- more than 5 $ is too much -rrb- , and share it while you catch the twinkling tower during the first five minutes at the top of the hour .",1
did not have to queue for very long .,1
we spent quite a bit of time sitting around the tour eiffel during our recent holiday in paris .,1
"if you have ever seen eiffel in pictures and think its a beautiful structure , wait till you go to paris and see it in front of your eyes .",1
you ca n't be in paris and not to see this tower !,1
you should expect lots of street vendors trying to peddle stuff to you - when the police show up they all scatter and come back .,1
it 's worth the long wait in line .,1
while waiting to go on up we saw others having no problem buying tickets on their own at the ticket window .,1
this was truly a spectacular experience !,1
"i was mesmerised by the tower even during the day , i could n't get enough photos of it and with it - but seeing the fireworks was more than magnifique !",1
this is a city so there is always plenty to do .,1
we did a city tour with paris city vision with a 2nd floor eiffel tower access .,1
"the tour eiffel located on champ de mars , is an iron lattice tower -- tallest structure in paris .",1
the experience is like no other !,1
remarkable engineering .,1
a wonderful experience .,1
a must for paris .,1
absolutely amazing !,1
but he agreed it is a must see in person .,1
i went at 10 pm so i ca n't verify the starting time .,1
paris from such a high view is great .,1
"the views at the top were spectacular , they have made it accessable to all ages and abilities which is great .",1
"the queues can be long , it is n't cheap , and the viewing deck is exposed , so if it rains it 's going to be a bit miserable .",1
the eiffel tower is always impressive .,1
nice grounds to have a picnic and watch the tower and people mingle .,1
the tower is not particularly artisitic in design and strikes me as a glorified radio antenna tower .,1
"tons of people of course , but a must see in paris !",1
only 1 person sorting out the dedicated lift so it took 30 mins queuing and made us late .,1
be sure to purchase the skip the line pass or you will spend hours in line .,1
"we loved it , kids loved it , the pickpockets loved it , it was a lovely , lovely place .",1
we 've been once again to the eiffel tower and it never seizes to amaze me .,1
getting out on the 2nd floor means another lift to the summit -lrb- and another queue -rrb- but again not too bad .,1
eiffel tower is an object that attracts human attention initially by its sheer shape and height on a paris surrounding and the stories that go with this gigantic structure .,1
"under the eiffel tower at the end of the day , is the best place to do your parisien picnic !",1
you take the lift from the foot of the tower to the second floor .,1
who the heck painted it !,1
"well , the week we were there was the national day of france , so we can not take proper photo of the eiffel tower ... please avoid to go there when the french are celebrating their national day as you will not get a good shot of the tower also , they set up performing stage there too , and they do not take away straight after ... it was still there even on my last day in paris before i travelled to south of france ... so when people told me how french people do things very slowly , i did not believe them , but after experiencing what i went through , i totally agreed .",1
beautiful when lighted at night .,1
security is strict as you can imagine but the lines were moving swiftly .,1
the line to enter security was shorter than it would have been at peak times .,1
"always book ahead , if you visiting paris and the eiffel is on your list .",1
elevator ride to the top was good but not for people who are afraid of heights .,1
this visit in 2017 was disheartening because of the level of security and checkpoints .,1
as always well worth the wait !,1
"but remember , you havnt been on the eiffel tower unless you go all the way to the top !",1
"depending how fast you walk or if you are taking photos , the walk up is anywhere from 10-30minutes .",1
due to terrorism alert access is controlled and you ca n't just walk freely under the tower anymore .,1
its amazing !,1
eiffel just made me fall for paris .,1
"the architecture , buildings , landscapes , and the river all make up this absolutely gorgeous city .",1
felt butterflies at first sight .,1
"you can also take a siene river cruise from eiffel which takes you around the major attractions on siene river , usually takes an hour to start and get back to eiffel .",1
"the walk down from the second level , 620 steps , should take no more than five or six minutes .",1
"we reached as far as the second floor , tried to resist to the wind as much as we could and enjoyed the view , definitely amazing .",1
loved it and took good pictures .,1
"for any visit to paris , this is always the first place people visit in paris .",1
"well , indeed the most spectacular part of paris .",1
"well , you can not really tell people you have been to paris without having been to this tower to be honest .",1
had a guided tour of the tower and surrounding area .,1
whatever you imagine like is to be there : is not !,1
what more can you say about one of the most iconic structures in the world .,1
i have always dreamed of going to paris and visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"although the current state of the world requires the security gates and searches , i was a dramatic change from my younger years when i could simply walk directly underneath the structure without any gates .",1
tower can be seen from long distance .,1
from all the pictures we 've seen i think we just had very high expectations which we got let down by .,1
"obviously seeing the eiffel tower for the first time was absolutely amazing , we couldnt stop looking at it .",1
we pre-purchased tickets for both dinner and elevator to the second level but it was n't that busy as it was raining the night we went .,1
we went mid day so both lines were long .,1
we had not purchased advanced tickets and showed up at 6:30 pm on a beautiful september evening just to take some pictures and look up from the ground up.forum chatter and reviews made me think we 'd have to stand for hours to get in - especially if not there early in the morning .,1
having the tickets ahead of time was a time-saver because there were long lines .,1
"the lift queue will still be long , so consider walking the 700 steps to level 2 .",1
make sure you take your camera .,1
do n't forget your camera .,1
i will say that it is a structure that still looks like it will be there for centuries to come .,1
you ca n't miss it if you go to paris !,1
was very beautiful !,1
there were so many of them flitting in and out of the crowds that it became rather intimidating since i had my mother and children with me and i wanted to keep them safe .,1
just a nice place for a picnic or a walk .,1
"the queues were long , so we took a cruise around instead which was lovely",1
there is a reason this place is synomous with love .,1
i dont understand how a wrought iron structure can inspire romance in the city of love but it kind of grows on you .,1
many beggars around eiffel and city parks .,1
"it 's what makes paris , the lovely paris .",1
"people had set fires , broke windows at the ticket/security offices at the tower , trampled/destroyed the plants and flowers on the perimeter .",1
"there were undercover security staff walking around , you had to go through security to enter the perimeter of the tower and you went through security a second time before you took the elevator up the tower .",1
stunning when lit up so stunning that my now wife had no idea i was down on one proposing as she so fixated on the tower all lit up .,1
very nice and amazing experience . . . you have to go to the top ... .,1
going to the top is nice but not necessary .,1
i visited with my wife both during the day and night ... the night view takes the cake,1
i 'd buy your tickets in advance ... i know a lot of people say you can walk up any day and buy tickets and that is very true .,1
thought this attraction would be costly but it was n't at all .,1
specially when the lights on the tower and bottle of champgain !,1
we went in the afternoon with pre-purchased tickets so it saved us lining up .,1
we had pre booked our slot here and visited at 5:30 pm .,1
"for people that do n't know , it definitely worth going there .",1
we learned while we visited that french workers sort of make up their own work rules .,1
hard to come up with anything new about the eiffel .,1
"for the best view of the eiffel tower , climb the 3-400 steps of the arc de triomphe and see it for some good photos too .",1
"also , you will find many street vendors selling trinkets in the area .",1
best part of paris .,1
my initial impression of eiffel was that it was an overhyped tower made of steel .,1
missed the night view of the lighted eiffel .,1
the site had a high level of security which made us feel re-assured !,1
we took it by accident .,1
that was the best trip in my life .,1
the night - every hour light show is quite amazing,1
"being one of the wonders of the world , this place has been high up in my bucket list .",1
the iconic paris monument .,1
a must !,1
"be careful about the time of year you go ... because if a night-lights view is what you are after , you will have to choose the late seating .",1
at the top of the hour for 6 minutes the eiffel tower not only is lit up but it actually twinkles like brilliant diamonds !!,1
"no visit to paris is complete without going up the tower , and if you have a bucket list put this attraction at the very top !!",1
i had pre booked my tickets before we travelled and our allocated time slot was at 12noon .,1
very moving !,1
if you go for the first time you get impressed on the first full view of this steel tower .,1
"while the whole paris is in a deep early morning silence , eiffel is welcoming thousands of tourists .",1
i think that everyone visiting paris should visit and ascend this amazing landmark - you wo n't forgive yourself if you leave paris without seeing the parisian skyline !,1
we went for sunset and then stayed to see the tower light up after dark ... magical and romantic !,1
"been up there for free when my husband and i had dinner at 58 tour eiffel and still , i was stunned with its beauty !",1
what 's not to like ?,1
"it was a surreal experience , getting to the top of the eiffel tower and there was even an ice rink on the 1st floor !!",1
it 's the best in paris .,1
"glad i was there on off season as it was busy , cant imagine what it would be like in the summer a must if you go to paris",1
the eiffel tower was everything i thought it would be ... .,1
this is one of the very few architectures which left me went ` wow !! ',1
we had a difficult time finding tickets that would work in our schedule .,1
"go to the summit if you can ,",1
the lines were short and we made it to the lift in 15 minutes from the time we entered the line .,1
"you can get tickets to go to various decks , or to the top .",1
it 's as good as you think it is.,1
you can enjoy both view : day view & night view .,1
"the eiffel tower looks great , at night looks much better when it is illuminated , the explanation about how they build it it is very interesting .",1
having got us through the turnstile we given two hours to have the stylus back to her with no excess charge .,1
better when viewed from other locations versus be under it .,1
we had blue skies and sun so the views were stunning .,1
"at the summit , there 's also toilets but no queues when i visited .",1
best to bring a blanket and pick a nice spot in the park !,1
its nice to be able to say we have been but i was a tiny bit dissappointed as there were no cafes etc alongside and thought this was an oppertunity missed,1
first thing when you think of romance .,1
"once enter the tower and take the elevator up to the top floor , you have the best view you could possibly dream of .",1
"great attraction to visit , i have only been here once before when i was younger and remember it so much more now .",1
it continues to attract huge tourist day after day .,1
the tower is so much bigger than you imagine until you have actually stood right beneath it .,1
i really enjoyed my trip to the eiffel tower .,1
"yes , you must see it but we actually enjoyed the views from the 1st and 2nd floor much better .",1
ascent of the eiffel tower even more special than it already could be !,1
"paris is a beautiful city as you can read from other forums , with the eiffel tower as its most famous landmark .",1
"advice to book in advance but not a long queue , we waited around one and a half hours to take the lift to the second floor , another queue if you want to go to top .",1
"we had thought about going up during the day , but decided to go up at night so we could be up there during the light show .",1
words ca n't suffice the beauty of this architecture .,1
later on you might need to wait at least an hour in the lines .,1
3000 in line before me .,1
anyone going to paris and not visiting the eiffle tower is unheard of am sure !!!,1
book a tour company for this and you will skip a couple of lines and save a lot of time .,1
did n't get to the top as they shut it .,1
we went to eiffel tower in early august .,1
we ended up booking this through viator - paris night combo - skip the line private seine river cruise and eiffel tower guided tour .,1
the views are amazing and there is so etching on every level .,1
it is most impressive to see at night .,1
the beauty and the romance of paris are outrageous with the light show .,1
"when you arrive , make sure you 're in the right line .",1
we could not get the tickets to top floor even with 2 months of advance booking .,1
the security services and ticketing are well maintained ...,1
the weather was sunny and a bit chilly .,1
so went to eat and came back in the evening .,1
although little misty still great view over paris and the physical structure of the tower is very impressive .,1
"see the views , glass floor and cinema .",1
the climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps .,1
some find this too scary but the art work underneath adds to the fun .,1
i really recommand this place because i have a lot of souvenirs there .,1
it 's just one of those things you have to do !,1
go to the trocodero in the 16 th arrondisement -- that 's a great place to take pics with the eiffel tower !!!,1
"that area is so sketchy , especially at night .",1
"we , along with other `` newcomers '' , were snapping pictures and selfies , as we continued to get closer .",1
perfect for anyone .,1
alternatively climb the arc de triomphe for great city views and to shoot the eiffel from a different angle .,1
way easier !,1
"unfortunately it was a quick visit , but oh so worth it .",1
loved everything about it .,1
worth a visit in the day time just to look at the architecture of it .,1
a must see on the map paris attractions .,1
the tower sparkled with vibrating lights on this evening boat ride .,1
amazing view from top .,1
the size of tower will impress you on the first go itself .,1
loved watching the night show on the hour .,1
"once in a lifetime memory , great evening for kids and adults .",1
this is my second time up the tower with the added bonus of a meal in the restaurant up one of the towers legs .,1
"at the beginning this tower , of 324 meter tall , was created for just few months for the universal exposition in 1889 .",1
"first time visiting paris , loved the whole atmosphere of the cosmopolitan city .",1
we went at night and the view is amazing you stop first at the second floor for a first sightseeing but the top view is definitely the best .,1
they reportedly sell-out to tour guides quickly but if you plan well you should be able to see the eiffel tower without much difficulty or wait !,1
we watched the light show and then queued up .,1
when we were up there the lights on the tower came on and it was magical .,1
it was quite windy and cold on the side of the tower with the best views of the city .,1
"if you ca n't get tickets online , do n't worry they are available at the tower on the day .",1
its worth the waiting in lines .,1
gives a complete birds eye view of paris .,1
best done on a clear day to enjoy the view .,1
"the views are great , and watching it light up was great .",1
the panorama from the top gives an awesome view of paris .,1
"however , i do n't recommend going up it , the queues are enormous , and you can get a good view of paris from the pompidou centre or tour montparnasse .",1
we visited the eiffel tower while on the `` paris in one day '' tour .,1
very expensive souvenirs and best bought somewhere else .,1
"however , even there the views were absolutely amazing .",1
"we arrived at 8.30 am and waited for security to open at 9am , we were maybe 6th in line .",1
"it is a shame the extra security now needed means you have extra delays accessing lifts and ticket sales , so probably best to book online if you can , but do it several months in advance if possible .",1
i recommend picking up a croissant and coffee and getting in line early so that you are in one of the first few cars to go to the observation deck before it is too crowded .,1
what can i say other than the pictures do n't do it justice ... go early to avoid the queues and the trip to the summit is worth if even if getting up to the top is a little confusing with people pushing in where they can !,1
the view from the top is nice but without the eiffel tower in the background you do n't know you are in paris .,1
a definite must see and do if you visit paris .,1
the view from all three floors is just spectacular : -rrb-,1
very impressive monument .,1
"very crowded , was a must see , but will not go back again .",1
"the 1st day that we were in paris , we rode a bus around the highlights of paris .",1
go see it sparkle !,1
"total enjoying that tower ... just sat and looked this time , did n't go up ... but to be honest .",1
no problems getting lift back to to second floor .,1
spent 3 hours or more there in the end .,1
"also , if you do the eiffel tower in the evening just before sunset and then finish it off with a river cruise -lrb- right down from the tower to the river -rrb- , take the last river tour available in summer -lrb- 10:30 pm i believe -rrb- then you get to see paris at night and the eiffel tower all lit up .",1
all must see the eiffel tower once in their lifetime .,1
"when she reached the cashier and explained , she was refused a refund with the comment `` well you knew it was hot , you should not have come here '' .",1
this time we came with kids bought tickets online to visit 2nd deck once we got to 2nd deck we checked to see if we can go all the way on top it was very easy to get tickets only tickets were not available .,1
it is truly beautiful and impressive in person !,1
"so , we did not get to go up the tower .",1
"i suggest going at night inside the tower , it 's so beautiful .",1
i would say the view of the exterior of the tower is way better than the view in the tower .,1
"next , we skipped those ticket lines to a short-line entrance to the security checkpoint , then were lead under the tower to see the original steam-driven equipment and weight system that operated the elevators .",1
you have 1-2 eating joints/cafe on the 2nd floor & the price is not exorbitant .,1
or when it lights up !,1
last week when we visited the area and gardens around the tower were cordoned off due to the preparations for the football euro 16 .,1
"due to cooler weather , it was cold and windy at the top but the whole experience was very good .",1
warning : long lines to go up into the tower .,1
every time you see it you remember where you are .,1
not worthed to wait in the line .,1
certainly worth the money ... and booking ticket before-hand .,1
the film was also very interesting .,1
we also planned to eat in a restaurant there but reviews suggested that the view was not guarantee in restaurant seating so we decided against it and we walked the grounds of the tower with many other people .,1
it 's a `` must-see '' in paris .,1
"but sitting on the lawn in front of the tower can quickly become annoying since you get bugged about every other minute with one crappy request to another , from buying some crappy , overpriced drinks you can get at the local supermarket 50 meters away for a third of the price to god know what .",1
its nice during the day too but nothing compares .,1
"the tower is great and bigger than i tough , much much bigger .",1
the glass floor on the 1st floor is very nice !,1
no long line in april .,1
walking by siene and just having some sunshine sitting there and feeding pigeons was an awesome relaxing time we had as a family .,1
"fabulous views of paris , a highlight of our visit .",1
we visited the eiffel tower in september 2014 but did not venture up as we wanted to pack a lot more into the day .,1
delicious beautifully presented with an amazing view of the tracadero .,1
we arrived as the light show was starting which was amazing .,1
it was nice just to go up for an overall view of this great city .,1
took the stairs up the tower because the queue was shorter .,1
also make sure you go into the shops and watch the videos on the big screens - they are in a room opposite the toilets but we were the only ones in there !,1
with the added bonus of being down from the tower in time to see it light up .,1
342 mtr tall structure developed in 1889 !!,1
we went to eiffel with three children .,1
we had visited the tower during the summer months when the trees were leafed out and the flowers bloomed .,1
been there 3 times and still feel it was not enough : -rrb-,1
definitely worth visit to paris !,1
amazing and spacial place !,1
must see but probably not worth the wait to go up elevator .,1
i wish i was treated so well in my own country during my pregnancy .,1
paris is romantic if you like paying tons of money for everything and enjoy waiting in lines for hours at every single place you visit .,1
always feel great at the foot of the tower and walking a bit on the champs de mars folllowed be standing on trocadero and viewing the tower .,1
had no lines and not bumping into people all over you,1
if you take the metro then eiffel is like 5 minutes walk from any nearest metro station .,1
we really enjoyed getting drenched in the rain near eiffel .,1
"well , one ca n't fail to see it ... it 's an imposing attraction .",1
you never expect how huge is the eiffel tower until you see it .,1
is there really anything new that can be said about the eiffel tower .,1
we were able to take pictures with the entire tower in the background .,1
the tower itself is dazzling .,1
"we had tickets so it was only a few minutes lineup to get to the first level , we had coffee there & waited for evening .",1
we also got the opportunity to view the eiffel by night from a distance and saw the 5 minutes of added lighting at midnight .,1
"ascended to the very top during sunset , was so cool to witness the transition .",1
lines to get to the top and lines to get back down .,1
i would have picked our time better in hindsight as a sunny sunday afternoon had brought everyone out .,1
"i 've been to water towers , church towers and other towers , but let me tell you , the eiffel tower is at least twice as tall a tower as those other , maybe even three or four times as tall , now that i think about it .",1
"when you go to paris , stay in this neighborhood .",1
"amazing view to the city , great illumination !",1
i love the eiffel tower but i would n't bother with going up it .,1
but heed all the rick steeve 's warnings and pre-book your ticket .,1
it is an outstanding bridge .,1
"if its your first time , then please take the lift to the top .",1
"but when you get to the second level , immediately locate the ticket booth to purchase your lift ticket to the top of the tower .",1
a must see when visiting paris bit definitely need to book in advance .,1
english speaking guide .,1
who cares how much it is just do it .,1
it 's a monument that 's pretty well known and there 's not much i can add .,1
we were not aware and the wait was three hours .,1
"it 's striking and the area around is worth exploring , too !",1
"it was a beautiful clear , but cold day , which really helped .",1
stopped at the cafe for a drink before getting the lift up the remainder of the way,1
"my visit to the eiffel tower was great , i would suggest arriving there before it opens so you can get a good time to enter as it is extremely busy and i recommend taking the lift all the way to the top and the taking the stairs all the way down , that was really fun as we were seeing who could get to the bottom first .",1
the view was incredible .,1
our kids aged 6 & 8 did really well .,1
this tower will always stay with me .,1
it was a sunny day so we got good pictures !,1
it was so much fun when i visited it !!,1
it was a chilly day which probably saved my life .,1
everyone visiting paris wants to go to the eiffel tower .,1
been to paris lots of times but never managed to get near the top of this as the queues are horrendous .,1
so we went early and waited online to get in .,1
views from the top were incredible !,1
what a difference .,1
"unfortunately , the tourist trappings which crowd the area rob this iconic monument of its grandeur .",1
spent about an hour and a half on this trip and as we were student it were 8 euros which is amazing for the experience,1
you have to bring a loved one with you when you go up to the summit & this time i brought my son & took one of those skip the line guide .,1
i am astounded by it every time .,1
luckily we figured it out before she was able to get us .,1
it starts with a strict security check .,1
skip the trip up and just take in the view and have a leisurely drink and snack along the nearby seine .,1
"if at all possible , pre-book your ticket the day before in order to avoid very long lines .",1
"if you have ample time , dont miss to check out the twinkling eiffel at night .",1
enjoyed my visit here .,1
it 's a must see !!!,1
top floor is closed because of renovation or maintenance but the eiffel official web site did not mention that .,1
we were one of them !,1
i believe there are two lifts to go up and go down the tower .,1
the view was spectacular !,1
do n't get too comfortable or caught up in the view !,1
i highly recommend this .,1
we brought our 8yr / 4yr / 3yr old kids with us .,1
it 's such an amazingly beautiful structure that you fall in love with it .,1
"nice view from the top summit , but not imperative to go up if you do n't have the time .",1
i would say if you 're in paris for any length of time you have to do the eiffel tower .,1
i enjoyed the visit every bit as much as my previous visits .,1
i highly recommend the climb by foot of the 1.710 steps to the top .,1
there are several places to get a great view of the tower - trocadero is free and maybe the best - can be busy - the most amazing view of the tower is from the 59th floor of the observatoire panoramique de la tour montparnasse but costs .,1
it also good if you stop by in the bottom of the eiffel and observe the details of its construction .,1
if you stay at the eiffel tower long enough they have random times where they have the tower light up and it looks like the tower is sparkling,1
for maximum drama try to visit at dusk just before the lights fire up !,1
"on the way down the elevator stops on the 1st floor , where are glass terraces and you can enjoy seeing what 's under you .",1
we did not go up into the tower because my husband is afraid of heights .,1
breezy to say the least .,1
"i would highly recommend making a reservation in advance online - you are able to skip the ticket lines , which were quite long .",1
these tickets sell out very quickly .,1
but they move you around quite efficiently .,1
"this time i did n't go up for the view , but it is definitely worth it .",1
it was nice to see and beautiful views of paris .,1
it really is a beautiful landmark .,1
"if in paris , you should take the time to see the tower .",1
"you 're able to get right underneath the towers without paying , and can get a great view of the iconic tower from around the champs de mars .",1
"we were in line for about 20mins , but once you are up there you forget about the line and just enjoy the view and the romance of it all .",1
"there is nothing more magical than the eiffel tower at night -lrb- video is best -rrb- , but you also have to go in the daytime .",1
we did n't go inside or to the top but being under the structure was enough for me .,1
great views up top of a historic city .,1
me and my wife were here ten years ago and then we went up in the tower .,1
fantastic not to be missed .,1
lots of food souvenirs .,1
"so here is the best tip : skip the elevators and walk up the first two levels -lrb- 750 steps - not horrible if you are an active person -rrb- , then buy your ticket to the top on the 2nd floor where the lines are short .",1
july and august are the high season and the lines to visit are up to 2 hours .,1
i 've been there 10 years ago .,1
a must see in everyone 's lifetime,1
i do n't prefer to be shoulder to shoulder in a small elevator .,1
"the cashier went speak to her manager , and when she did , she returned with a refund .",1
there is the option to buy the ticket to go to the very top of the tower on the 2nd floor but the ticket office on the 2nd floor is not always open and when it does open you have to line up again for 30 minutes to one hour to buy a ticket .,1
we went late in the evening planning to see sunset .,1
"we visited the tower with a 5 year old and a 13 year old , we had a truly remarkable experience .",1
;-rrb- and do n't forget to watch it glitter in midnight !!,1
certainly a check the box spot,1
one of the most famous attraction in paris .,1
we circled the tower looking for the stairs down to avoid the crowded elevator but never could find them !,1
on one side you will get to see the lush green grass while on the other side you have the beautiful seine river .,1
and again .,1
a once in a lifetime experience .,1
there are so many people at one point in time that you have to keep running and keep your eyes open to find the right place for photography and better view .,1
the view from eiffel tower was amazing .,1
definitely recommend them .,1
"and go up it , to get an idea of how paris is laid out , before you start your wanderings down side streets or trips to other museums .",1
we did not venue inside the eiffel tower .,1
go to the top of the tower even if you are terrified of heights like i am !,1
it was really cold & windy out on the observation deck -lrb- being december -rrb- but champagne could have -lrb- and would have -rrb- been enjoyed had we not been so cold .,1
my first view of it after big expectation was what big deal !!,1
"never been to the very top of the tower , and if you want to go you have to buy the ticket in advance !!",1
the view is amazing and the light show at night is spectacular !,1
"this time , i just walked to the base , and chickened out seeing the size of the lines and the heat .",1
we visited the eiffel tower twice - the first time in the evening when the lights were turned on and it looked all sparkly - tacky ?,1
the eiffel tower is a must when visiting paris the views were amazing and the prices reasonable .,1
this attraction is so great .,1
once you are at the top the observation area is totally doable .,1
"it is paris , it is one of the world 's greatest structures-don ' t miss it if there !",1
"not only is the eiffel tower a symbol of paris , it has been a symbol of france in times of mourning and celebration .",1
beautiful sight by night .,1
the panoramic view of paris and its monuments is just fantastic and stunning .,1
we ate at the jules verne restaurant which brought us 1/3 of the way up the eiffel tower .,1
you can enjoy dining and bar here .,1
great view of course it took about 30 minutes just to buy a ticket a total of 2 hours mainly spent in the line.this is the quiet season,1
"i ve been twice in the eiffel tower and certainly , i would turn it into my home place if i could .",1
when i went to paris with my mother there were two things i wanted to see ... the louvre and the eiffel tower !,1
at $ 25 however i found it impossible to bypass the official eiffel tower website .,1
the iron lady of france,1
the city was shaken but its resilient and it wont allow anything to stifle its beautiful magic .,1
it is definitely a monument worth seeing .,1
we stopped off at the 1st floor and walked on the glass floor !,1
the best way to go here is to purchase your tickets prior .,1
"i had already dreamed of what it was like however however it was a great monument , not as romantic as i expected to me it was a well constructed spiral into the sky .",1
"it costs a lot , especially if you have n't booked your tickets earlier ... but it worths it.the view of the river seine and the panoramic view of paris are something you will never forget !",1
enjoyed the views from level two and the top .,1
the view from eiffel is unbelievable !!!,1
you can walk but lift is far easier .,1
"if using the metro , get out at the trocadero stop to get the best initial view of the tower for photos .",1
we purchased tickets through viator prior to our trip .,1
we saw it from the ground - but still made a huge impression of `` wow !!! '',1
we stay in the 7th so we see it quite frequently .,1
windy at the top but the views are spectacular !,1
"but as organized as the ques are on the ground level , they are unorganized on the first level where you switch lifts to go to the top .",1
there are lost of lucky lucky men by the tower .,1
other reviews said it is possible to by tickets on the 2nd level to ascend up to the tippy top .,1
"we prebooked our tickets online to visit at a fixed time , choosing to go to the summit too and were really glad we did .",1
"our group met at trocadero and walked to the tower , while our guide gave us information about some of the sights along the way .",1
off course you will visit the eiffel tower in paris .,1
you have a great view on top of it ... the waiting line was not too long and is was not too expensive ...,1
very cheap as well !,1
one has to visit this place once in his lifetime .,1
save yourself a ton of hassle and just pre order tickets ahead of time .,1
admittedly there were long queues but we went early in the morning -lrb- 8am -rrb- and were only twenty minutes waiting .,1
well no words to describe the tower but be careful of the cheats around .,1
"go to the top , nothing like it .",1
when you try to book online to go up the tower - it is often booked out months ahead in summer .,1
i was fearful that nothing would be as beautiful as my vantage point from the seine .,1
there are a few problem though .,1
"before you go up , do n't forget to look up the tower from the ground .",1
loved the eiffel tower this was my 2nd visit and going at night is great from the ground the night we went was misty you could n't see much but still an amazing experience !!,1
"we okay , a bit of an exaggeration - i should have said behind fencing wire - but how things have changed in 25 years .",1
plan to book a ticket in advance because ticket quota runs out quickly .,1
do ensure to visit eiffel once during day time time and next after sunset .,1
eiffel tower glittering at night is a spectacle to behold .,1
enough said by others on this .,1
seeing the eiffel tower in person was simply amazing !,1
"what can be said -- it 's the eiffel tower , the symbol of paris .",1
"firstly , i will start with how amazing and knowledgeable the tour guide was .",1
"this trip was wonderful , i travel with my 16th year girl in that time , we spend a great time visiting paris .",1
check live camera available on web before going there .,1
beautiful place !,1
"incredible views and you can see all the famous landmarks in paris -lrb- napoleons tomb , norte dame , arc de triomphe -rrb- lite up and they look amazing .",1
i have not seen any other paris site that was similar .,1
the guide was a funny british guy who knew shared all kinds of interesting facts about the tower as well as surrounding points of interest which you ca see from the tower .,1
i bought ticket for $ 17 to go up on tower to see the whole city of paris .,1
for a tower that was built for a worlds fair in 1896 .,1
"the eiffel tower is a must for any visitor , even if you do n't ascend .",1
there you get out from the station and suddenly you see a huge structure that you wont forget it .,1
"but this january , since tourists were few in number , so we gave it a go .",1
eiffel tower truly deserves to be central attraction of paris ... and in evening its simply a view worth cherishing .,1
"i would suggest always take the ticket for the top , because if you take the ticket for 2nd level and decide to go to the top it would be difficult , 2nd level has restaurant and souvenir shops .",1
unfortunately the fountains were stopped - economizing water i guess - and that was a shame .,1
wait in line for hours then once you get up there you are like meh .,1
we usual go once during the day to see the cityscape and then again at night to see the beautiful lights .,1
foggy on one side and clear on the other .,1
excel by viewing of paris / get your selfie stick and enjoy ;-rrb- - restaurant on the 2nd floor is abir of an old fashion ... to reconsider before stepping in,1
very spectacular especially at night with the different lights that twinkle & go off .,1
"we walked around it , but did not go up.in warm weather there are places to sit in the park and eat lunch .",1
we are so happy that we went up there .,1
there are lots of street vendors who walk the area trying to sell things or get you to donate money to a fake cause .,1
sunday .,1
we went to the eiffel tower as part of a tour .,1
"he said if we purchase the dinner , we skip the line .",1
you do n't have to pay to go and have a look and you can even stand right underneath the structure to look up .,1
you can pay extra to go right to the top but we didnt as views were good from where we were .,1
we had dinner before going inside .,1
other than that it is a must see in paris .,1
never imagined paris to be that large .,1
it was fantastic seeing the eiffel tower for the first time .,1
"ofcourse paris cant be complete without seeing the eiffel , even if its the 100th time :-rrb- walk around the gardens and feel romantic",1
stunning views of paris from a stunning height .,1
probably best to go in off season .,1
a must do when in paris !,1
you would be better of with a tour before arriving to your visit .,1
i 've never seen such an amazing thing !,1
amazing place .,1
"had a fantastic time with my family in paris and this wonderful monument was the first thing we visited , highly recommend to get tickets online to avoid time / lines , with it you will go directly to the lifts !",1
grrr .,1
we fast patched because we had reservations for bistro58 up in the tower .,1
go up 90 minutes before dusk .,1
"i wo n't go into each course as it was only for this special menu , but suffice to say each course was prepared and presented to absolute perfection .",1
buy tickets well in advance .,1
"i have n't yet been to the top -lrb- zero visibility the day we were there -rrb- , but it must be fantastic .",1
very humbling to this amazing piece of artwork .,1
you can spend about 2 hours in this attraction .,1
europe 's one of the famous if not the most famous landmark .,1
umbrellas are almost useless in that wind .,1
beautiful views from the top .,1
there is a small bar where you can have champagne as well :-rrb-,1
"we chose the latter and it was absolutely worth it , as you can see the landscape of the city farther away than from any other point .",1
it is still an amazing feat of engineering even viewed just from below .,1
views from all over the city .,1
"so what can i say it 's something you just have to do if you 're in paris , i waited in a long line on a cold and cloudy day to go to the top .",1
paris -lrb- 巴黎 -rrb- is the most romantic city in the world .,1
by this you can avoid long queue of getting the ticket first and then the entry .,1
you will wait .,1
one can go to the 3rd level with lift and ticket cost is euro 15 .,1
got to know them for 2 hrs !,1
standing tall as a symbol of paris the eiffel tower and champ de mars surrounding it was crowded as usual .,1
the souvenir shop also available there if you want to get a gift for beloved family,1
it 's a little chilly when the sun goes down so bring a jacket .,1
"we love gazing at the tower from the pont alexandre bridge , or from virtually any vantage point in paris .",1
book if possible as queues are very long anytime of the day .,1
"see it from the river a bridge , or a secret spot you might find .",1
"buy tickets online as it saves you so much time.you have to put your bag through security which is great and you are checked on entry.you climb in to the first lift where you will find a few souvenir shops.then take the next elevator all the way up to the top.i thought the lift going to summit was never going to stop.from up the top there is a lovely view.champagne bar , for a glass it is 13 euros.dress warm as it is cold being up so high .",1
if you go up with a tour guide you use the tour guide only entrance and it is quick .,1
came here for the xth amount of time .,1
we had time for a quick walk around the first floor taking in the views .,1
you know you are truly in paris when you look up and see the eiffel tower .,1
a group of us went to the top and well worth it for 17 euro - great views of the whole city !,1
stunning views in the evening,1
do not miss it !!!,1
i recommend getting off at the 2nd floor and going down to the 1st floor to get views of the glass bottom floor then making your way up back to the 2nd floor to get up to the summit .,1
"if you have great weather , even better .",1
"it 's cold and windy this time of year , but we got to see the view in the daylight , sunset , dusk , night , and be in the tower when it started sparkling !",1
"it got a bit misty , so we did n't climb to the second floor or the top , but even the 1er etage is outstanding with great views of the city .",1
when in rome !!!,1
if you go i have some recommendations : first-buy tickets in advance .,1
i would n't recommend walking for anyone with even a whisper of a fear of heights though .,1
the eiffel tower never gets old to me .,1
"my day is not complete without seeing it either passing by , eating in a restaurant with the view or staying at the hotel !",1
enjoy making memories in paris !,1
"and , the hustlers at the base of the tower will ensure than i do n't go back .",1
"while having lunch at the jules verne , we were able to visit the revamped eiffel tower .",1
"i think people are just using it as a `` skip the queue '' option , as the guide did not seem to think we would be interested in the history and engineering of the tower .",1
one really cool thing to do with your smartphone : fast motion of the elevator ride to/from the 3rd floor - looks really cool in instagram .,1
the first time i visited this structure i was struck by how big it was .,1
bought the cheaper ticket which was to climb up by stairs .,1
i called my loved ones across the world from the top of the eiffel tower !,1
"whether its day time or night time , it is so charming and beautiful .",1
long lines so it is best to buy tickets and reserve time before you get there .,1
"once you get to the 2nd floor - go and buy the 6 euro ticket to the summit - you might as well , chance of a lifetime .",1
if you visit paris you have to go there !!,1
"buy skip the line to get to tour eiffel summit , you wo n't regret it .",1
there are no threats in the whole world that could stop me from visiting that lovely and exciting place again and i encourage everyone who can by a ticket to paris to do it as soon as you can .,1
and thats to go to the top !,1
"the queues were huge so we did n't make it to the top , but the whole experience from the ground was pretty amazing too .",1
"while it was good , we just do n't spend money like that so it was quite a shock .",1
if you have never seen it before in person be prepared to be amazed .,1
even though we had the skip the line tickets but we had to wait in the queue for security check .,1
"we loved the experience , but it is something we would probably not repeat .",1
you must kiss your love on all of the places to kiss -lrb- we were on our honeymoon ... -rrb- see if you can make it for a twilight view across all of paris and you wo n't be disappointed !,1
the queue was long and takes an hour or two just for the ticket but it 's all worth it !,1
come back and take a look at the tower during the night !,1
mesmerizing !,1
we went up in the afternoon for some incredible views and then walked over to the arc de triomphe to watch the tower light up at night .,1
the view from all decks/floors is just incredible .,1
careful for pick pockets around the base but we did n't have any problems .,1
i recomend going at dusk .,1
we took great pictures in the evening .,1
"towering 324 meters equivalent to a height of a 81-storey building , eiffel tower boasts of thousands of tiny lights and projecting its presence in the dimness of night that can be seen all over the city of paris .",1
"my husband and i wanted to go up into the eiffel tower but learned they were n't taking any `` reservations '' until november and our trip was in september , so we made reservations for lunch and got in right on time with our scheduled appointment .",1
great spot for picture taking and then start walking toward the tower until you are under it - awesome !!,1
there are wine vendors selling for your toast under the tower .,1
just watch out for the damn pickpockets that plague the place .,1
one of my favorite spots to visit in paris .,1
but beware of the pick pockets and anyone coming up to you asking if you speak english .,1
took the train from london to paris .,1
definitely go at night when it 's lit up .,1
a must for every visit .,1
"1 week before the trip , we wanted to book tickets for the the lift that will take us to the top but all tickets were sold out on the website all the way to november !",1
avoid such situations !!,1
"still , sixty minutes of standing in the hot sun finally gained us access to the painfully slow ticket booth .",1
simply this :,1
pre booking is essential !!,1
but it still beautiful and magnetic .,1
fascinating to be able to walk right underneath the tower .,1
"buy tickets online , buy tickets online ... ca n't emphasize more , but you got to come with the ticket , if you can afford , the fast pass ... that 's the only way to escape the queues .",1
"although you will see it from many points in the city , make some time to actually go to it .",1
buy a youth tickect -lrb- its up age 24 -rrb-,1
that 's when it 's worth it .,1
"if you want to avoid queuing , book a ticket online in advance .",1
well suffice to say all our expectations were blown away .,1
do carry a selfie stick .,1
"once on the second level we purchased from a gift shop , a lift ticket to the top .",1
skip the line ticket was the way to go .,1
by doing this we skipped a long line for lift tickets from the bottom .,1
"one of the things you need to see and do when you go to paris , its just a shame that you now have to go through all the rigmarole of security , but that 's the society we now live in .",1
"with the carousel across the street all lit up , it 's absolutely gorgeous .",1
it 's hella touristy but who cares !,1
we purchased tickets through a tour and it was more than double the cost of regular entry tickets but the good part is that you can skip the incredibly long line .,1
a must see however,1
best views ever .,1
we chose to walk up which means you beat a lot of the queue 's it 's only 669 steps !,1
do not leave paris without seeing the magical sparkle : -rrb-,1
we just like to observe .,1
only negative is there are a lot of people surrounding it that will harass you for money or ask to draw you but it 's definitely a must see !,1
here is a tid bit of information i found out through researching .,1
i would definitely advise booking online to book the queues .,1
we got tickets to walk to the second floor and the views were fantastic .,1
do not miss this folks .,1
"7 euro per person , but worth the experience .",1
we did make the ride up the tower on our 3rd trip to paris .,1
if you go in the winter time it does get really cold up on the top so dress warm .,1
if you want to go to the top of the tower you would need to book but i prefer it from ground level .,1
"our tour guide was knowledgeable , the history and all the fun facts were enjoyable to learn .",1
we did get a picture of the tower at night though later from a different location .,1
we went up to the lower level and fortunately had our binoculars to look about the surrounding neighborhoods .,1
there was plenty of security at the entrance and exits so i felt completely safe .,1
by the time we left at midday queues were very long .,1
"a metal fence barricaded the tower and paid tickets would give access to those who wish to climb the tower , just bring extra patience to put up with the long queue .",1
i visited it at night and during the day .,1
we were slightly disappointed with the eiffel tower .,1
the architecture is breathtaking and even moreso when you see it from afar or in the evening when you see it sparkle .,1
"beware of the pickpockets , and ladies wanting signatures for fake charity !",1
my wife always wanted to go to paris and see the eiffel tower and on our 2nd anniversary i fulfilled her wish and it was spectacular as could be imagined .,1
"views of the surrounding paris spectacular , and how could you not visit this well known sight .",1
"while the experience of those views is breathtaking , i felt the need to add some contrast to the reviews which ignore the theme park feel of it .",1
i was assured by the cashier i could go to customer service on the west entrance and get my money back after my visit .,1
"youngest son got tired a little at the end , but the rest of us were very happy .",1
"the day we were there was perfect weather , minimal queue to go through security , we decided to use the stairs so purchasing a ticket was easy .",1
"iconic monument , what 's there not to like ?",1
there are street sellers and `` charity workers '' following you around invading your personal space to get you to part with your money .,1
we visited the tower as part of a day trip which included lunch .,1
the friends that were with us were in their 70s and they decided not to come up and stayed down at the bottom and waited for us .,1
"having seen the rooftops of paris from montmartre two days before , we had no interest in going up .",1
"came here with my girlfrien , it was a magical trip .",1
"but once you are there , with the exception of the views , thats it .",1
we walked towards the grassy field towards the main part of town .,1
ofc u must see when in paris .,1
looks fine from the ground .,1
"the views from the top were amazing , well worth the climb since we took the stairs .",1
you can dine - 2nd level - although it is very pricey and a must reservation ahead of time .,1
"and the savory meal , attention to details like the j in the butter , the presentation of each course all were well worth the price .",1
"there are long lines for the lift , both up and down .",1
i then very happily gave him the finger back and left the tower,1
"we ended up taking a cab to the eiffel tower from the saint germain area where we were staying at 9:00 pm , after we had finished dinner .",1
a must for your visit to paris .,1
gives you a sense of the history of the place .,1
it is a beautiful tower and part of parisien tradition .,1
!!!!!,1
"during our insight tour , we visited the tower at night -lrb- i believe 10pm -rrb- when the lights began twinkling ... it was breathtaking & beautiful !!!",1
only the tower .,1
crazy !,1
beautiful ... but seems out of place in a more beautiful paris .,1
beautiful struck for a beautiful city .,1
"i booked tickets -lrb- with time reservation -rrb- on-line several months in advance , but then i 'm a big planner .",1
ironically you get some better view 's from further away .,1
"incredible must see , but i have to say i would not go again ... .",1
the most famous symbol of paris .,1
beautiful during day and night .,1
"we saw the eiffel tower on our visit a few years ago , and overwhelmed by the street vendors constantly harassing you as we approached from the river side .",1
"long ques to go up , but a beauty to look at .",1
"i went there for 3 days and it was awesome paris have a lot places to go and the view of eiffel tower is something especial , is a good vibe there .",1
"essentially just paying a premium to avoid lining up , no other value in this `` tour ''",1
queues we 're very long but a great great place to view paris,1
an amazing monument of paris - it was wonderful to see it for myself .,1
a bunch of people were stuck on a mid level without tickets that reach the summit .,1
"did the river boat cruise , saw it by day , thought it was magnificent ... .",1
did not book in advance and did not want to wait in line .,1
"do n't go in a hoodie , but you do n't actually need a tie .",1
food and drinks were included in this package .,1
beautiful park next to it we had a great time,1
"the fun had out on the levels , gaining the best views .",1
you can not go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
a got ta do at night to see the lights of paris !,1
tip : the hot dog stuffed inside the french baguette -lrb- you can buy this on the 2nd tier -rrb- is completely awesome .,1
"but every hour probably as it starts getting dark , the tower is lit up for about 2-3 mins with hundreds of lights and it looks like a beautiful sparkly diamond ornament .",1
no lines and everything was included in our ticket .,1
wont recommend a day visit .,1
the queues and service were as expected and it was lovely to see the tower lit up in the dark and the beam of light rotating around it .,1
would recommend anyone to visit at night as you can see the lights of the entire city .,1
we went right to the top and had champagne which is something i had always wanted to do .,1
"i do n't mean to put you entirely off , but please use your common sense .",1
"at least in mid november , that is .",1
the queue is long .,1
there are many street vendors selling souvenirs at the bottom - it 's ok to negotiate with them - we paid less than 50 % of their original asking price .,1
this is the most beautiful tower i have ever seen .,1
definitely should be on you must do list when in paris,1
buy your entry tickets before arriving make entry so much quicker .,1
view is magnificent .,1
always long queues to purchase tickets so prebook and this will get you up to the second etage within an hour .,1
the queue is much shorter and you can see all of the tower while climbing and see the view grow as you climb higher .,1
you can not miss the eiffel tower you will have a great view 360 degree of paris .,1
the view from the top is absolutely beautiful and you would n't want to go back .,1
i recommend going to the top !,1
"one of the world 's iconic monuments , the eiffel tower is pretty to look at , and offers a wonderful view of paris and a very good restaurant with a view .",1
what a spectacle from all angles .,1
take a lift right to the top to get a great view of the city .,1
the upside -lrb- we found out later -rrb- was that the crowds were management .,1
i was lucky to be able to get tickets since tickets are sold out very fast .,1
we did n't take the tour to the top of eifel tower .,1
"i found the food court disappointing , and the souvenirs are the same as on ground .",1
on the hour there is a light show .,1
"if you have never been to paris , a visit to the eiffel tower is mandatory .",1
"we came to the eiffel tower late afternoon and had to wait in the line for almost 2 hrs , first - a line for the tickets and then the line for entry .",1
it 's disgustingly touristy .,1
"amazing experience , ca n't wait to go back !",1
it just was n't that important to go up as it was to see it .,1
looking at photos from friends who made it to the top it 's not that much different but makes a difference .,1
we visited paris on a romantic break .,1
last but certainly not least was the very informative tour by our wonderful tour guide - the history around the eiffel tower was incredibly interesting !,1
we followed the recommendations from others and went up the stairs rather than by elevator .,1
"on a saturday during summer they have a small market in the park grounds selling speciality products , food , souvenirs and even a roller skating rink !",1
i did not realise the lift went straight to the second floor until i stepped out .,1
we had purchased tickets via viator.com and managed to skip the queues and go straight up to the 2nd floor of the tower with no wait and no problems on a 10am slot .,1
the walk down is even quicker .,1
it is also worthwhile using a company for a guided tour .,1
"impressive , romantic .",1
beautiful at night as well as in the day .,1
you cant come to paris with going up the eiffel tower .,1
thank god they had a loo on the top though .,1
the 4th and last way i saw the eiffel tower was as a backdrop from the park beside it .,1
breathe taking experience .,1
this is a great way to see the eiffel tower and dine without spending too much money .,1
there is a champagne bar to help you enjoy the view .,1
"we did no queue thanks to the booked ticket , we only had 20min queue to go to the top 3rd level .",1
do n't book tickets through online tour sites .,1
"you will still have a small wait , but the view is worth it .",1
there are usually long queues on the 2nd level to go up to the 3 level .,1
we visited this amazing piece of history .,1
"this part of our visit was the most difficult as we had 2 small children , and they were hot and bored .",1
from what i can see there are 2 official behind the scenes tours and good to have someone telling you interesting facts but a big bonus was to skip the lines to the escalators .,1
"saw it every day , never enough .",1
loved the intricate sewing of the steel .,1
the place being a central attraction is mostly crowded and we were warned by our guide to be cautious of the pickpockets who are common there .,1
everyone know .,1
the fog rolled in and you could n't see anything except the tower and it was magnificent .,1
it 'll been on your bucket list .,1
those views are spectacular .,1
pricey but the view makes it totally worth it,1
it was a dream come true to see this .,1
amazing both views !,1
it 's a fun day out .,1
this artistic piece of metal is one beautiful site to watch !,1
"except spectacular view and grandiosely construction , tower is noting special .",1
i had the gasp when i first saw it .,1
"fee was 17 euros to get to the top , less if you wish to get to a lower floor or use the stairs .",1
armed men is the present day but necessary .,1
i got a reduced price as is the case for most born in the 90s .,1
a gorgeous 360 view of the city of light !!,1
"i 've read so much about the design , construction and affect of this tower for my entire life .",1
by far my favorite part of our vacation !,1
we are so tired with only this trip that we ca n't barely go on to our next sightseeing .,1
awesome !!!!,1
the most romantic iconic structure .,1
i recommend making the eiffel tower a flexible agenda item and do n't get too hung up about opting out .,1
we wanted our visit to be special but we did n't know what to expect when the meal was described as `` a picnic ! '',1
not quite sure if it 's worth going to the top though .,1
you can also go higher with special tickets .,1
awesome views even though it was rainy .,1
"the tower offers exceptional views of the paris metro area , even if you go only to the observation deck level -lrb- as we did -rrb- and not to the very top .",1
queued for eiffel tower by accident - meant to be visiting something else .,1
it is one of the most iconic sights in europe and is always spectacular whether the views from it or looking at it lit up in the evening from a distance .,1
"summary first : do go and see it , but do n't bother going up !",1
must do dinner at 58 !,1
the view is better on the mid levels .,1
in my opinion it 's okay to give a miss climbing up the tower if you are short of time .,1
"ok it is stunning to look at , but we had a terrible time at the eiffel tower .",1
did an evening bike tour of paris .,1
highly recommend to go and visit this location in france .,1
it is so interesting to speak with people from all over the world .,1
small bars and surrounding nice .,1
just visited to see the euro 2016 fan zone .,1
makes me cry everytime i see it .,1
great views from the middle deck .,1
"you will walk past long lines of people who are attempting to buy day-of tickets , and you will avoid having to wait in those long lines !!!",1
it was everything and more than i had imagined .,1
once on the second floor you are advised that for an additional cost you can by a standard ticket to the top ...,1
"shorter than i thought , but still just as beautiful .",1
the tower website provides an excellent amount of information so you can plan your visit ahead of time perfectly .,1
"the weather was perfect , the vendors hawking their wares and families strolling all around eating ice cream all under the watchful eye of the magnificent eiffel tower !",1
they were so worth the wait .,1
we were on a europe trip recently .,1
"nice place and very unusel tower , , , , to see paris city , , , lot of visiters came from arround the world , , , ,",1
"i also recommend seeing the tower in the evening , it 's wonderful .",1
really no crowds at that point .,1
we passed on the -lrb- overpriced -rrb- champagne at the top opting instead for the more affordable drinks on the first floor .,1
i 'm going to get negative responses but the americans -lrb- & i 'm not one -rrb- know how to manage major attractions better .,1
wonderful views all over paris .,1
the only issue is that there are a lot of people trying to sell you items and it becomes a hassle to walk around undisturbed and truly enjoy the sights .,1
"it is an iconic and a hugely impressive building and the views across the city are brilliant , it is great to see landmarks you may have already walked around -lrb- or may be due to walk around -rrb- and is an incredible sight from all aroundf the city .",1
as there was a long queue to buy tickets but its was all worth the wait !!!,1
you can get great views of the city from level 2 or higher .,1
if you go to paris you need to see the tower .,1
visit february 26th .,1
go at night -- the on the hour lighting is so impressive,1
you dont have to go up the tower to experience the beauty of .,1
i was 7 months pregnant and they allowed me to bypass the long lines which i was shocked by .,1
the top floor can only be reached by a second elevator which you will pay separately for .,1
the crowd was insane .,1
i have been twice over and will be sure to return for a short shopping break !,1
on the day we visited it was raining and because we were limited for time we never got to go up the tower .,1
"couldnt believe how cheap it was to go up the effile tower for starters , was expecting it to be very expensive .",1
eiffel tower at night with the twinking lights is the most beautiful man made monument i have ever seen ... what a beautiful scene it was ... to go to the top of the tower with out long waiting time its better to go early in the morning around 8 30am .,1
fantastic experience as expected !,1
"amazing guided tour , we had a brief historical 15 minutes talk before we entered the tour .",1
definitely go at night and during the day to check it out .,1
we visited the eiffel tower in september this year and the view was magnificent .,1
"there are lots of things to d - get some snacks at the nearby cafes , ride a merry go round , or just simply have a picnic on the lawn across the tower .",1
"having been to the top once , i do n't think it adds a tremendous amount extra for the time and cost .",1
i 'm a people watcher and this is one of the best places to see all and hear all .,1
you can not go to paris and not see the eiffel tower .,1
"i was a single woman traveling alone , and i was fine .",1
always a pleasure .,1
this is awesome - it is mind boggling to view the structure itself from underneath from each side .,1
do n't miss any of the levels as each one is special in its own way .,1
"also , go and see the tower at night too when all lit and see the blinking/dancing lights at the top of the hours for 5 minutes .",1
i have seen the eiffel tower a dozen times and each time i am dumbstruck by how wonderful it is .,1
nothing represents paris/france more symbolically than eiffel.you cant afford to miss it .,1
beware of pickpockets as they are prevalent .,1
there 's an option like that -rrb- you have to do it earlier in the day .,1
"the eiffel tower lives up to it 's reputation , we were able to get some great photos from across the river from the plaza which had amazing fountains .",1
we walked up to the second level .,1
man darf gleich nach der tour in den aufzug nach oben -lrb- 2 .,1
thank god we went with a group .,1
we had summit access and a walking tour guide from fat tire tours and we had a greta visit .,1
"we had a knowledgeable guide who knew exactly where to go , gave lots of helpful commentary and led our group of about 20 people up both levels to see the awesome views .",1
not a great view of the city at night .,1
"the police came once within an hour time frame to run them off ... into the grass that is ... then they came right back after he left , like it was a game .",1
we bought a premium ticket beforehand so we do n't have to queue but it was not that long of waiting .,1
"amazing by day , unbelievable at night .",1
"make sure you book online for a ticket - you usually need to do so a few days in advance , you get to skip a lot of the queues - we unfortunately did not do this and there were n't any online for the time we had left in paris .",1
long lines and crowded elevators .,1
"you can climb 300 steps to the first & second level , but the third level stairs are closed to the public .",1
"there 's nothing like venturing up all those stairs , flight by flight , reading little tidbits of information .",1
definitely worth going all the way up .,1
paris is famous for the iconic eiffel tower that rises upto 1000 ft with three viewing galleries .,1
great overall experience .,1
very crowded and need 2 hours to enter traffic people and not fun at all recommend that you only visit the site from outside,1
went and took pics with the family -lrb- hubby and 8 year old -rrb- during the day and again in the evening .,1
"could n't get hold of fast track tickets as it was easter but we went along at around 8 pm and queued up , just over an hour and a half but with pleasant weather and lots of other tourists in good spirits it went quickly .",1
normally tickets to go to the upper side are sold at least 2 weeks in advance so try to book it thru the official site .,1
a nice start for our visit to this amazing city .,1
made a great walk worth it .,1
good place to visit with family .,1
this time i just took a longer time viewing and enjoying this piece of history .,1
views of the city are unreal .,1
even for the solo traveler like myself ... a must see - once in your life,1
so we took photos around the tower .,1
"from any view up close or far , it is just beautiful .",1
went here last november and had a great time had champagne at the top and the view was great !,1
"it may seem like a cliche site , but it is something special to see .",1
"it 's a classic , it 's beautiful !",1
just love this place !!,1
looking forward to coming back here at night .,1
"go early in the morning to avoid queues ; choose to walk up to the 2nd floor if you can , this option is always less busy - check weather is good so your views are n't limited too .",1
night time is just amazing !,1
get there as it opens at 9.30 during winter to gain quicker access .,1
it appeared as challenge too but after 10 minutes looking we found someone and been told that top bit was closed ... i was very disappointed because wanted to take my fiancée all the way tho the top because it was our first time in paris together and mine second time and both times i was unlucky with top closed .,1
but in the end its all worth it .,1
i like to research so many sights said to get tickets before you go and i 'm so glad we did .,1
you must stay until 1800 to watch it sparkle in the evening !,1
-lrb- visited december 2015 -rrb-,1
"the only probably was the day we were going to visit , strong winds came through and the summit was closed .",1
which was high enough for me .,1
lunch was surprisingly good for a large group limited menu meal .,1
its a lot prettier from far though and was ridiculously busy although it was the hottest weekend in europe and summer was late so i guess everyone was over-enthusiastic to sight see .,1
"as you walk farther away , the photos look even better -lrb- up to a certain distance , of course -rrb- .",1
small group taken swiftly in till level two .,1
there is no greater tourist attraction in the world than monsieur eiffel 's iconic erection !,1
it is imponent and majestic any time of the day .,1
"try and book your ticket in advance -lrb- there 's a queue for those who even do this -rrb- - i went during mid-february , outside of school holidays and there were still massive queues to get in .",1
we chose to take the stairs instead of the elevator which saved us some time .,1
you ca n't go to paris without putting this at the top of your list .,1
i waited in line then went up some elevators then walked around the top deck .,1
so impressive and beautiful .,1
"true , we went on a weekday out of summer holidays but still ...",1
"the morning we went was still cloudy , so hardly anything was visible from the top .",1
be patient .,1
"it is a beautiful , and romantic steel structure .",1
and when she sparkles ... breath taking !,1
no one picture or movie actually can depict the magnificence of this french icon construction .,1
go early in the morning and make sure to reserve well in advance .,1
eating at jules verne you are able to get on the observation deck as well .,1
we paid a much higher amount to expedite our venture since the lines were extremely long only to find out it only took us to the second level .,1
ticket only included second stage so then paid another 6 euros pp to go to the top but had to queue for 1 hour for this .,1
but when we arrived it was closed due to strike .,1
"simply a must visit , a couple of helpful clues , ... arrive early , paris tends to be a late starter , get to the eiffel tower before 10am and avoid the queues .",1
we both felt that the tower was the least interesting thing we did in paris .,1
"since my 1st visit to this attraction 27 years ago , i have been here many a time .",1
"even from outside you 're blown away , but then you get to take lift to 2nd floor -lrb- pay extra there for summit -rrb- and gorgeous skylines and view for miles .",1
best view is from the park behind it and from the stairs at sacre cour area .,1
the best part is you can see eiffel tower from any part of paris as if its following you .,1
crepes are a must !!,1
"me and my friend waited for maybe half an hour , which is not bad at all because i expected to wait longer .",1
we were about 20th in the queue at that stage and had to wait until it opened at 9 am but then we sailed in and had the most brilliant time among the first people to the top that day .,1
we used the elevator and ascended to the top .,1
booked the behind the scenes skip the line tour .,1
it 's an amazing sight and beautiful when it is lit up in the evenings .,1
the climb was the equivalent of going up 40 flights of stairs to get to the first and then the second levels .,1
"it was so easy to meet at the fat tire office , get kitted out with their ear-pieces and then walk straight through security and the line on to the elevator at the tower .",1
i had heard that the third level was n't worth it but i thought it was pretty fantastic .,1
from the top of the tower you can see the panoramic view of paris .,1
on our last visit we went up in the tower .,1
we had a great view of the seine and the staff were extremely helpful .,1
this saved us over 2 hours of standing in queues .,1
they have changed the colour of the tower to a much dull shade which does not suit it but its spectacular at night .,1
"in the line and the lift , you are up close with people ...",1
i choose 10:30 am to try and avoid the crowds but it did n't work .,1
the first level -lrb- lower -rrb- has a good view of the city and shop .,1
it has been very well preserved and maintained .,1
but going up is totally overrated .,1
our estimate of the line to buy tickets was at least an hour .,1
take time and have a picnic on the grass around as we did today .,1
i was also quite annoyed by people trying to sell souvenirs or draw portraits on every step .,1
i would n't do it again .,1
"ah , the eiffel tower .",1
a wonderful experience finally achieved .,1
always super busy with people from all around the world .,1
"certainly worth the wait , we had a fast pass ticket .",1
must see the tower at night .,1
waited for about one hour in the queue in february .,1
"i did n't climb to the top , but really enjoyed walking around the base and viewing the tower from different angles both close and afar .",1
"definitely pre book your tickets , or you will spend a number of hours queueing .",1
"whilst eating starter , a lady came over interrupting and started taking a number of photos of us !",1
definetely like a traveler you have to add this place to your bucket list .,1
be wary of the people with flowers they pretend to give you a rose to find out it cost 5 euro do n't take the rose .,1
must do the eiffel by the night,1
"it was disappointing , and annoyed that there should be sign or notification advising the tourist !",1
must see attraction of paris .,1
i suggest getting a boat cruise tour during the evening since the city lights up beautifully at night .,1
not the most important thing to see or do in paris but a must do .,1
easy entry with tickets purchased online .,1
no words !,1
come to visit the eiffel tower at the hour that conects between light hours and the darkness each season it 's changes a bit the view is spectacular .,1
"on my second visit yesterday evening , we joined in the queue for the tickets .",1
the long lines are not worth the trip to the top - just walk around it .,1
"very proud of myself , definitely recommend for the views .",1
you may buy upto 3rd level at 17 euros.a must see .,1
minimal queues - recommend go at dusk as get a day and night perspective .,1
great views of the eiffel tower !,1
"of course it 's must see in paris , but i truly recommend to visit it by night , it 's really amazing , it worth the long waiting to get up there , if you drink you can have glass of champagne at the top of the tower , then you can chill out by cup of nice coffee at the 1st floor .",1
we saw a short queue at the ticket booth and the lady at information counter said it was not a busy day .,1
climb the tower really awesome too,1
i walked 2.7 miles from my hotel to the tower the night before i left for the us .,1
"the view , the history , the iconic nature of it are just like they say it is .",1
go there in the late afternoon if you can can so you can wait for the tower to light up in the evening -- this will save you the trip of having to go back .,1
and it never fails to impress !,1
"alternatively , you can buy tickets online to skip the lines which could be worthwhile if you 're short on time .",1
do n't look like a victim and they 'll move on to an easier target .,1
"should book thru agent to avoid long lineup to buy ticket , you also have a tour guide with you to tell the story .",1
gift shop is expensive and the restaurant even more .,1
i have been to paris several times now and i almost always visit the eiffel tower .,1
it was my best trip ever .,1
it cost 9 euros each but they did have reduced prices for under 24s .,1
you have to go !,1
i ended up leaving !,1
"we only went to 2nd floor but that was enough , first floor has cafes , shops and a restaurant and toilets and you are not rushed to get round and leave .",1
"very expensive , but why not , it is a memory that lasts a lifetime !",1
"we could not get tickets online in advance , even though we tried to book them far ahead of our trip .",1
no waiting in any line ups !,1
the lines to go up it were huge and we did not want to even attempt to wait .,1
i would recommend it as it was n't as busy but the views were spectacular,1
we still has wonderful views of the city .,1
a short flight later we were living the parisian life .,1
"you queue for the tickets , you queue for the lift , queue for the second ticket to the top and queue for the lifts again up there .",1
another must do : read the `` poor '' eiffel tower reviews on this site if you want a good laugh .,1
i do n't and so tried to book my lift ticket in advance online .,1
the key is getting up to the top and not having to fight a crowd .,1
it was an awesome experience & one we will always remember .,1
"the elevator up can be a bit packed but , as we were doing this at the beginning of the day , we did n't want to tire ourselves walking all the way up .",1
you wait in line and go up an elevator then wait in a really slow line and go up again and people will cut in line .,1
"our tip is to look skyward , and definitely travel to the third level .",1
i spent romantic weekend with my husband in paris .,1
"unfortunately for us the top was closed due to the sheer number of people so we could n't go all the way up but nonetheless , it 's a great view even from two thirds of the way up .",1
"queing takes endless time , but the view from the top floor is definitely worth waiting for !",1
"i knew this tower was very tall , i just never imagined the base to be so huge and spanning .",1
really enjoyed taking my children to see eiffel tower we went to the second floor lovely views and lovely weather great memories made it 's a must if your in paris .,1
it 's intricate design is a marvel .,1
"there is an atm within the tower so you can grab cash and get back in line , if you wan na walk up the eiffel tower .",1
"beautiful , stunning location with really awesome ice cream right next to it !",1
thank you paris !!!,1
well worth going right to the top and drinking champagne .,1
"my wife and i visited the eiffel tower and also ate there what a night.then we took in the sites louvre , went to montmartre , we saw the shows and we laughed when we saw the baby statue of liberty .",1
you must to see it during the day and return at night to take pictures again .,1
just viewed from below .,1
just do note that the queue is always going to be long .,1
we went for some pictures at night but then decided to come back next morning !,1
the eiffel tower was as beautiful as you can imagine .,1
fencing around the tower now .,1
thankfully my children insisted we queue to go to the very top .,1
but tower is beautiful .,1
"climb up to the top , worth it !",1
we were there in the evening and when we left the lights were lit .,1
"we approached the eiffel tower with a sense of touristic obligation , but it is truly worth the visit .",1
it really is an awe inspiring piece of engineering let alone architecture .,1
"once we finally reached the summit , it was amazing .",1
i spent my first afternoon in paris by the eiffel tour & it was wonderful .,1
of course you must visit it .,1
i went to the very top of the tower while my husband waited and viewed from the second level .,1
740 stairs .,1
"there were two choices , chicken and fish .",1
an overwhelmingly beautiful site that has to be seen to be believed .,1
"the views from the very top were great , particularly as we had great weather for it .",1
first of all there 's so much wrong with paris once i step out of the airport .,1
"we walked around the gardens , just watching all that was going on ... .",1
"go later to someplace like the arch to see it at night , you wo n't get the effect of seeing it lite up if you are on it .",1
i reached there around 10 in the morning after visiting the opera .,1
a well worth trip .,1
the queues if you have n't prebooked are very long so it is worth booking in advice in the summer .,1
wonderful to see .,1
"shorter lines to take the stairs , great view from first two levels , a very clean bathroom on level one and , of course , the best views in town .",1
really a review for the iconic attraction in this city full of so many ?,1
the wait through security to go up was way too long .,1
so just be prepared to have to go thru security beforehand !,1
the second was from within the tower itself .,1
get to know its history and purchase ticket in advance to avoid the extremely long lines .,1
i mean you can not forget to visit this place when its your first time in paris .,1
the food .,1
was pleased to see good security .,1
i ca n't imagine anyone going to paris and not seeing this sight,1
"as expected , we had great views , even though it was overcast .",1
to go back take the metro from la motte-picquet -- grenelle to get to your destination .,1
the sparking tower is pure magic .,1
"the view was phenomenal , but we did n't stay long as there were so many people .",1
"it is a magnificent piece of engineering but then if you have not visited this place , what do you expect ?",1
or go to trocadero -lrb- 5 min walk -rrb- and you can take wonderful photos !,1
this view is spectacular .,1
"the eiffel tower was an amazing experience , i recommend it to everyone .",1
"we did a tour in the afternoon and were able to skip the long lines and had access to all levels of the tower , including background information from our well informed tour guide !",1
"only disadvantage is that the place is too crowded ,",1
we wondered the streets of paris after dinner to the eiffel tower .,1
"at night eiffel tower is just amazing , especially when lights are going on for 5 minutes every hour in the evening .",1
"even with some fog , it was lovely !!",1
"climbing is a much better way to experience the tower and more fun , but be prepared for a bit of a workout .",1
"do n't bother going to the summit on a cloudy day , its not worth it .",1
the view from all levels is great .,1
"be prepared to stand in queue for some hours , but the tower is really impressive and the view is spectacular .",1
"it may be a major tourist attraction , but that does not take away from its grandeur .",1
long lines and crowded elevators but a must do if only once !,1
i visited the first and second levels and i have a fantastic view of paris .,1
just buy a ticket when your there .,1
we went to the tower with our guide .,1
there is an awesome restaurant in the building too .,1
"the steps were do-able but it 's not completely easy so if you have health problems , take lift from base to top .",1
"if i had a chance to buy tickets before hand , could have been useful and would be better if we had n't had to wait in the queue for long outside in bad weather .",1
it is definitely not overrated .,1
it was an amazing trip ... the people were so sweet and helpful !!,1
at night the eiffel tower is illuminated but there are times in the evening when it sparkles !,1
we enjoyed looking at it rather than going up it as it was closed after the second floor and the wind was bitingly cold .,1
so iconic .,1
it 's a great place to see the view .,1
superb monument but not a fantastic experience with long queues !,1
allow lots of time to walk around and take photos .,1
"ladies , please do not wear dresses .",1
we spent a week in paris and out hotel -lrb- cadran -rrb- was a short walk from the eiffel tower .,1
"throughout the tower there are many crappy expensive shops , that i 'd strongly recommend avoiding .",1
the lines for the elevators are long .,1
"if you really would like to grasp the size and beauty of the tower , go at night , sit in one of the benches and have a hot chocolate .",1
stop at every floor - they all have their own charm and views .,1
alway fantastic .,1
"the surrounding area is nice , a few food and drink stalls , souvenir shops etc. .",1
you can then take the elevator all the way down .,1
when the tower is lit up it is breathtaking .,1
"one of the most iconic places in the world , so not gon na describe it !",1
we just sufficed ourselves with views from the 2nd flr balcony -lrb- not bad -rrb- .,1
they are gypsies and thieves.i nearly had it happen but my husband was standing a few feet behind and they then saw him and keft,1
definitely worth the wait - if you come early enough it wo n't even be so long .,1
"pack a picnic and head to the champs de mars -lrb- best views , get off at trocadero -rrb- .",1
and enjoy the view : -rrb-,1
"having done both i would n't do the summit , you see just as much from the floor below !",1
you can see the entire city below you and the feeling is good .,1
we were lucky that there were no real lines so we zipped up and took a peak and then zipped down and were off to other sites .,1
tip : go at night time if you want to go up .,1
this will save you hours of waiting in line .,1
we arrived by subway and as we walked towards to the tower passed several yummy looking food vendors .,1
"we are in group of five persons visit eiffel tower paris , at night time and morning session .",1
i will go back,1
acrophobia is the only legitimate excuse for not going up the eiffel tower when visiting paris .,1
will be back !,1
we bought our tickets in advance and had pretty much no wait at all .,1
the rest of us opted for the lift and we waited 15-20 minutes .,1
stunning and amazing .,1
"walking up the stairs of the metro , walking just a few metres and seeing the eiffel tower is just breathtaking !",1
not a single welded piece .,1
we had to wait for 2hrs during noon to get into the lift which took us to the 3rd level of eiffel tower .,1
the views on a good day are really something .,1
have fun and enjoy these beautiful attractions in paris !,1
of course one must visit the eiffel tower when in paris .,1
"viewed from many points around paris , the best is from the river cruise .",1
another great way to see it is to go up the arc de triomph ... beautiful .,1
until you are underneath you do not realise the size .,1
lots of photo op around it .,1
"the top most level was closed for renovation when i visited the place , missed out the experience at the very top .",1
"we also went back at night to see the tower all lit up , which was so beautiful .",1
"there is a metro stop nearby so it 's convenient , too .",1
when you reach the top you can stay inside and still enjoy the views but it is much better to walk up those final few steps and go outside to get that wow .,1
"pictures of the eiffel do n't quite do it justice , it is quite a sight to behold in real life so it is a definite must to visit when you 're in paris .",1
"the real spectacle of the tower is at night , it is simply stunning .",1
our very knowledgeable tour guide sebastian made for an interesting tour of the eiffel tower .,1
the top level was then closed without warning due to being over capacity .,1
beautiful sight at night .,1
you have to queue quite a bit no matter how you do it .,1
the information desk attendant was incredibly helpful and helped us to purchase group tickets for our students .,1
"luckily it was still light out when we got to the top , so we were able to see the city with both day and night views .",1
long line to go through secuity to get into the area .,1
"you can climb it -lrb- going up with the stairs or an elevator -rrb- , but personnally i think the view over the city does n't match the view you get on top of the arc de triomphe .",1
"if you are wanting to go to the tower , definitely book your tickets in advance .",1
"first viewed at night , light up a beautiful golden hue and then the twinkling lights took us by surprise .",1
"i hate hearing complaining french , complaining about `` loud , overbearing americans '' .",1
eiffel tower is the place which can not be left out if you visiting paris .,1
looks amazing in real life .,1
"first of all i walked with my niece about 40 mins from the big wheel in the middle of winter in paris to see the eiffel tower , and was it ever worth it !",1
"as a world traveler , widely regarded , paris is one of the most beautiful places on the planet and i wo n't hesitate to say that eiffel tower is a pinnacle of what this town has to offer .",1
the top was closed when we visited .,1
gift shops could be better .,1
i have some preference to go there by night and cross the alma bridge .,1
this was my first visit to the eiffel tower at night and so happy we did it !,1
and there will be a yes for sure .,1
"the price was fine , the wait was quick and the trip up in the elevators was smooth .",1
i enjoy looking at the tower at all times of days and from all angles .,1
"the tower is captivating at night , specially with blinking lights , every hour on the hour .",1
its a fair old wait .,1
good that the security is there .,1
we chose to visit at night to see the lights of paris .,1
there is an waiting hour of about 30-40 minutes but it deserves it !!,1
has to be seen in person to appreciate the eiffel tower and the beautiful gardens and fact it is across the road from sienne river .,1
being there to see the lights turn on is iconic and the energy in the air is amazing .,1
the base is full of scammers and hawkers selling junk .,1
we did n't have to queue much for here .,1
"yes , it 's the eiffel tower , and iconic structure , but the lines and crowds kind of ruin it for me .",1
but enjoy the fun .,1
nothing i guess ... just go !,1
we took the elevator up in the late afternoon and had a chance to see paris during the day - and at night .,1
would still like to visit again when work is n't going on :-rrb-,1
one of the most famous buildings in the world .,1
great spot with the right weather .,1
"the light show only lasts 5 minutes and it 's on the hour , so do n't miss it .",1
even with the tour tickets there were crowds and lines and waiting and inspection after inspection of our bags .,1
after eating we went to the top deck and finished our visit .,1
the magnificent eiffel tower has fallen into the 9th ring of hell .,1
loved the view but not the lines or the crowd !,1
be sure to buy your tickets in advanced .,1
current new standard security i guess .,1
"there is a line to purchase here , but it moves quickly .",1
what can i say ??!,1
there are few options to climb from each leg .,1
learning about the history of the iron lady was fascinating .,1
security was very tight which would put your mind at rest .,1
the guide gives you the background which was most interesting .,1
be sure to see the '' la tour eiffel '' when the colors change .,1
all the wines were 100 % from france.we received quite a wonderful lesson throughout our 3 hour meal .,1
the food in the effiel tower can be a tad expensive but it 's expected .,1
but it is so much more than that !,1
"great experience , went with my sister and her family ... she has a 10 month old baby and brought the stroller , which was difficult to lug up all those stairs and through the crowd .",1
the stairs may seem scary but they are no harder than the stairs of notre dame or sacre coeur .,1
we did guide tour and very helpful for skipping the ticket line and informative .,1
you have to visit eiffel tower during your life !,1
"its the most known place in paris , if you want to feel more the atmosphere you can go up the tower by stairs , if you fix your plan before you can get tickets online in advance so you wont wait for long queues , do n't lose chance to view paris from 3rd floor .",1
it 's so worth it !,1
will do it again but at night .,1
"if you want to impress your wife , girlfriend or friends book a table in advance for times and menu all on the website .",1
take one of the dinner cruises on the river to get a great vantage point of the tower .,1
the eiffel tower really is an impressive sight and can not really be appreciated until seen from close up .,1
went up to 2nd floor and view was just amazing .,1
"the tour guide was very informative , and the views from the tower were stupendous .",1
it was in december of 2015 .,1
"so , few tips to help make the experience better - we booked the evening visit to the eiffel tower at the time of making paris bookings through our travel agent , which was a very good idea .",1
must find yourself a good view at night as every hour there is a 5 minute sparkling light show which is mesmerising .,1
"paris was having unseasonably cold weather when we were there , so it was too cold to spend much time on the outside observation deck .",1
another must-do whenever on paris .,1
it was an amazing view !,1
the view is amazing and puts the size of the city into perspective .,1
"okay , probably the most cliche thing to do when in paris is to go up the eiffel tower .",1
the eiffel tower shares a nickname - la dame de fer -lrb- `` the iron lady '' -rrb- .,1
got a terrific sunny day and some great photographs of the tower and pleasant walk around the surrounding area .,1
yes it was everything i dreamed it would and more .,1
"you 'll find some interesting facts that you can compare with us buildings , etc. .",1
just the most fun thing to do in paris .,1
"we got the elevator to the top level at daylight , and saw paris wake up .",1
"we had purchased our passes ahead of time , but still needed to wait until the correct time .",1
my recommendation is to bring your own blanket and drinks and just sit and look up at the eiffel .,1
get your tickets in advance as the lines and wait time are long .,1
you see it from everywhere .,1
lots of people selling light-up tour eiffels in the street not he way but they were very polite about it .,1
this is the hardest part .,1
"went with my mom who is in a wheelchair , a kind french woman came over and told us we didnt have to wait in the huge line and could go straight to the front where someone would assist us .",1
will definitely be returning one day,1
full and safe .,1
be sure to visit at night !!,1
"there is n't much to say about the eiffel tower that has n't been said yet , so this review is more about ` tips ' for the visit .",1
"whether you visit it day or night , you got ta love the eiffel tower , 4 entrances and despite the long waiting time it 's still going up and seeing big part of paris from above !",1
"this is a favourite destination of mine to bring guests visitingparis , where i live .",1
magnificent structure .,1
you can not visit paris without going to the top of the eiffel tower !,1
but you do n't have to take pictures !,1
the light show at night is magical also a must see .,1
what is n't to love about visiting the eiffel tower ?,1
still the view was great .,1
"watch your bags , backpacks , wallets , etc. .",1
you can secure a vip pass in case you hate queue 's ... !!,1
explore the find cool camera angles and plan ahead if you want to go up inside -- go online and buy tix early and get a rez for the restaurant if you plan to dine in there .,1
we visit every time we come to paris .,1
"go up the tower , if you can stand the line .",1
we went to the 2nd level and then to the top on our own .,1
fun day and a great access to the top with the guide we chose ... lots to see and an amzing view from the top .,1
it is so huge and amazing structure and its well worth the visit .,1
in effect you are walking inside the engineering .,1
"we visited it three times - twice at night to see the magnificent golden lighting and strobe-light show -lrb- ever hour on the hour from 9 to 1 -rrb- , and once during the day with a `` skip the line '' guided tour offered by parisian tours .",1
"paris is a city with charm , history and romance .",1
your best bet is to book your tickets on line at the official site .,1
it was my second time here and first time going up .,1
"lines were long , about one hour at midday -- supposedly a quieter time .",1
rude families -- speaking french -- just cut in line at will .,1
heres how we did the eiffel tower .,1
we are in paris during the uefa football tournament and yesterday we sat by the seine watching the eiffel tower change colors .,1
we were staying at a place close to eiffel tower .,1
better buy it outside cheaper .,1
this queue we a bit longer and too about 25minutes .,1
we met half way between the floors .,1
"if you go , be aware of potential pickpockets -lrb- there are also plenty of signs warning you about them -rrb- .",1
walk up the steps to second floor .,1
around the grounds of the tower were family 's and groups of friends enjoying picnics and wine .,1
good to see from a river boat .,1
"only downside was the weather , a little cloudy .",1
try the night booking if possible .,1
the way it lights up and reflects off of everything is incredible !,1
"the advance tickets are sold out about 1 month ahead , so we could n't book in advance to save the queues .",1
"also , if you do n't book ahead you ca n't get tickets to the very top - they only had availability for the first level .",1
this is a `` must go '' place if you are in paris .,1
img .,1
one of the best experiences of my life visiting the eiffel .,1
"as a warning , you are not allowed to take any liquids e.g. a bottle of water , or heavy/sharp objects e.g. any padlock -lrb- which you may take for the bridge -rrb- or cutlery inside .",1
take time to look at each detail .,1
not helped by high winds on the day .,1
"yes , it 's usually mobbed with tourists and the knick knack vendors can be a real pain , but you ca n't do paris without visiting the tower .",1
the symbol of paris is a must to see .,1
this structure has become the symbol of french pride .,1
"spectacular , wonderful and she is as always a magnificent looking spectacle !",1
"must see in night , the lights that comes every 15 minutes .",1
shame it has to be surrounded by gates and security now but it must be protected.spoils the look of it,1
dont go there in winter .,1
the fact that there was no crowds and queues was a big plus and if you wanted to go the top there was no delays although the weather was n't cooperating it was a great experience .,1
eiffel tower is a must go place when you 're in paris .,1
seeing paris from another angle and from above : great experience !,1
how could you go to paris and miss this ?,1
so worth it !!,1
we got up early and went straight to the tower on the last day of our trip .,1
it has been 26 years since i 'd last been a university student studying abroad in the uk -- and spent a couple of days in paris during my winter holidays .,1
something that you ca n't miss when you are in paris .,1
"i was at the tower at night , i believe this was the perfect time , the lighting is amazing and it was a fun atmosphere .",1
paid extra for the skip the line pass and the tour ... worth every penny .,1
show up on the hour for a special night time show of many twinkling lights lasting for approximately five minutes .,1
this place is very attractive and surrounded with other historical places .,1
"it was the only opening available for the days we were going to be in the city , but i must say it worked out perfect .",1
we took a guided tour that we pre-booked so beat all the queues .,1
view from the top was magical !,1
you can eat at the jules verne if you have $ $ $ .,1
"but all this said , it is well worth the effort to get there .",1
you must go to the south corner to buy the ticket and begin the journey .,1
it was fabulous looking at the iconic building everyday whilst thousands of people watched football on the big screens .,1
the lines were to line for us to go to the top .,1
try and go both morning and night as they are both a magical yet different experience : -rrb-,1
of course it 's a must to visit the eiffel tower area when being in paris .,1
we visited august 18th and bought tickets on-line exactly three months prior to our visit -lrb- that is the earliest the site allows you to purchase -rrb- our tickets were for 11 am and they do not let you enter before your time .,1
"we took the 300 or more steps to the tower it was hard but worth it there , is a lift but the line was too long so that 's what we did the views that you see are breathtakingly beautiful you see views of paris there is a restaurant there and a gift shop and a other little place to get food were you can get a nice sugar pretzel and baguette , achol and fizzy drinks would highly recommend that 's its on your to do list .",1
we went to see it at night and during the day .,1
it 's what you 'd expect but seedier .,1
absolutely terrified -lrb- but i had made a promise to my grandaughter to do it -rrb- i somehow made it and as i stepped out of the lift what an awe inspiring view and it was such a different feel to the first floor .,1
great views though .,1
la tour d'eiffel is a massive monument and testament to french architecture at the turn of the century .,1
worth the two flights of stairs .,1
i think we should have visited at night as the view at night is more amazing .,1
it is definitely worth going up to the top .,1
be aware of restrictions on what you can take in as there is nowehere to leave banned stuff e.g. glass bottles .,1
iconic truly and visit t paris can never be complete without visiting here .,1
one should see this structure during night also.after 10.00 pm shimmering lights can be seen in eiffel tower .,1
we celebrated with a glass of champagne at the top - even in lit glasses .,1
it cost 7 euro to take the stairs up to the 2nd level -lrb- note that ground level is `` 0 '' first floor is `` 1 '' and 2nd floor is 2 .,1
other options available where you can take lift .,1
spend an hour and check it off your bucket list .,1
the views from the tower are breathtaking .,1
we took some selfies along with many others doing the same .,1
eiffel tower is what most travelers go to see in paris & rightly so .,1
"i think it 's worth saying that although the queues look intimidatingly long the system runs very efficiently , all considered , and staff do well to keep the lines moving .",1
my daughter and i shared a glass of champagne together .,1
definitely a must in paris !,1
"so breathtaking , lots of tourists and people selling things .",1
be prepared to queue in the sun amongst big crowds if you come in summer .,1
lot of wasted waiting time for guard to open up back stage locations .,1
we queued some more for more tickets and another elevator to the 3rd floor .,1
"the first visit was a tuesday , and when we arrived , we learned the workers were on strike .",1
so glad we did this !,1
we met the tour guide on 19 avenue at 5pm and then walked about 5 minutes to the tower .,1
the eiffel is an icon for a reason ; it 's truly spectacular !,1
live your life without fear of terrorism .,1
but it was unforgettable .,1
disappointing for sure - maybe i will have to return again to paris .,1
do not miss the changing of the lights at the top of the hour after sunset .,1
it takes about 10 minutes -lrb- if you are going slow and stop to read all the info on the way -rrb- and it is cheaper .,1
the elevator takes you to the summit where you can see the panoramic view of paris .,1
eifel as the world knows it is icon of paris .,1
no view from the top level -- just white clouds .,1
i had bought fast passes for me and my boyfriend .,1
the problem was the lines and travelling with two boys we did not want to wait for hours .,1
once there i sipped an overpriced glass of champagne while taking in the view .,1
"not because it benefits us is any way , but just so you could see this icon with your own eyes .",1
enjoyed a ride up the tower by -lsb- my tip for the day -rsb- booking lunch at the first floor restaurant and avoided all the queue - in france think food and wine and you are always in the priority line !,1
"luckily it was a sunny day , so went to the top , well worth it !",1
go a few hours before sunset so that you have time to climb to the top and then sit along the champ de mars to watch the tower light up at night .,1
it 's most beautiful at night time .,1
my husband poo-poohed me and said it could n't be .,1
"we were a family of four , my son had lost his ticket .",1
there are many places to view the eiffel tower from the ground .,1
the staff is very helpful and nice .,1
the eiffel tower sparkles every hour on the hour after dusk for about 5 minutes so be there in plenty of time to take photos .,1
a really good spot in paris .,1
we walked to steps to the second floor and then took lift to the top .,1
paris is afterr all the city of lights ... madame tour eiffel did not let us down .,1
"a lot bigger than i expected it to be and next time i visit paris , i will definitely be making the trip up to the top .",1
there were no crowds or lines !,1
went during the day and night .,1
-lrb- this was the only hiccup ! -rrb-,1
"when the lights are shimmering and people are enjoying with their kids and friends , its more picturesque then .",1
"the first level had a bar , night club , restaurant , cafe and a skating rink .",1
"the second time at night was definitley the best , we climbed the tower which was like a mini workout even in cold weather we had so much fun , there are ice rink , gift shops , cafe 's and more and goes without saying the sights and views from the tower are second to none , you can see everything and get some amazing selfies .",1
"of course , you also want to see it at night .",1
for sure the eiffel tower is one of the most known and easily recognizable landmarks worldwide .,1
"the first time , was a day time visit around 4pm , where we queued for about 40 minutes .",1
"we visited paris as part of a contiki tour , and our tickets included an express pass to the top .",1
the estimated wait time to get onto the elevator to the observation decks was over 3 hours .,1
"next time , i wo n't keep my purse in my backpack .",1
both spectacular and a must for anyone .,1
so many tourists so much security and still so beautiful !,1
this is probably the best known symbol of paris .,1
this is something you rush first to visit when you are in paris .,1
"this was an amazing experience to view paris city from a higher altitude , the view is breathtaking .",1
"visiting eiffel tower in paris was a breath taking experience , particularly the light show in the evening .",1
you also have to but the tickets to go to the very top to the tower when you get to the second floor of the tower so that can involve another 45 min of queueing .,1
"we walked the streets a bit , visited a couple of place and then continued on our journey .",1
it was our favorite thing to do during our stay .,1
there was no line at the elevator and ticketstand .,1
we stopped on the way for some lunch and a coffee .,1
you can spend a nice two hours with ou noticing the time passing .,1
must seen : -rrb-,1
paris is a beautiful city and the views from the tower are amazing .,1
"the best time to visit is a couple hours before dark , thus being able to see everything in the day light , but make sure you stay into evening when the city of lights really sparkles !",1
"we were there on a beautiful , clear day and the view from the top platform are spectacular !",1
the first time you see it at night with the lights is astonishing .,1
"it is a beautiful view , though .",1
"well , definitely was a dream come true.never realized though that eiffel would be so majestic in the night .",1
like this you can skip the ultra-long queues at the bottom of the tower .,1
you simply ca n't visit paris without passing by eiffel tower .,1
"been to paris before , but this time i was with a group of boys travelling from the us to france for a soccer tournament .",1
loved paris !,1
it looks beautiful and very romantic .,1
"being a paris lover , simply i love everything about paris , can never have enough of it .",1
it does give you a different feeling when you are already there experiencing it .,1
no matter how much u have read about this piece of wonderment .,1
visiting the tower location area is free ; there is a fee to go up - either walking to the first and second levels or the elevator to the very top .,1
"if you visit paris for the first time , the eiffel tower is a must to see .",1
also recommend the cheaper restaurant inside .,1
purchase ticket online to reduce waiting time .,1
symbol of paris .,1
"the lights of the city were breathtaking and was well worth the time to go to the top , even though a bit breezy .",1
in fact it is more impressive viewed from the river as my 25 different angled views prove !!!,1
"level two is still a great experience , however .",1
it 's a great way to see the eiffel tower .,1
we enjoyed the sight but the crowds were oppressive .,1
watch your belongings !,1
"if you can allow your mind to go back to the time when the tower was the world 's tallest structure , you will be even more amazed when you are viewing paris .",1
"a must see of paris , bigger then what you see advertised , always crowded look out for scammers and gypsys",1
there is an open air fast food restaurant on the first floor so you can rest before going up to second .,1
i could not spend much time their because of onward connecting flight .,1
when you are writing your name down they will ask for money - scammers !,1
for half term and school holidays you need to book a month or more in advance to get the tickets booked on line but saves queing because we walked past on monday and the queues were hideous .,1
"a must see , the highlight of a french capital , french pride ... absolutely stunning at night !",1
this was a family trip for my daughters 16th birthday and paris did n't fail us .,1
no need to book on-line ... the views are spectacular both day and evening ... bring some binoculars ... paris is more relaxed than many other cities ...,1
"it only cost 5 euros each and was well worth it , and only waited in queue for approx 20 mins which was good considering it was height of summer .",1
"do n't settle for the view on the 2nd floor , even if you have to queue during summer , you have to get tickets for the summit - the view is simply gorgeous !",1
"again , it was n't a life-changing experience or anything , but i 'm glad that i went .",1
lots to do around as well .,1
it is magnificent and a true architectural wonder .,1
we really enjoyed our day watching at it !,1
we 've gone up in the tower before so stayed on the ground this time .,1
of course the views are lovely .,1
it is another if not the first must see attraction in paris .,1
decent food and despite some pressure seeingly caused by a mechanical problem delaying the lift excellent service,1
we were really lucky with the weather and the reviews were fantastic .,1
you can not miss going to see the eiffel tower when there .,1
"even though i did n't get to the top , overall it was an excellent experience for me .",1
"i was able to get summit , skip the line tickets through get your guide .",1
it 's so busy in this area !,1
"make sure to go to second level , the highest floor .",1
check weather and news the night before going to the tower .,1
views over france were spectacular !,1
it was freezing right at the top but the view is worth the cold,1
please be careful with the gentlemen trying to see you things as they literally put items in your hands and beg you for money .,1
with all the sparkling lights in the tower it is just a delight for the eyes to watch it standing over there .,1
"unfortunately , the weather was pretty awful this time and the visibility at the top was zero !",1
well i decided to find staff and asked how can we go up .,1
can do the seine boat tour after eiffel if you go in the morning 9 ish .,1
"at 5 for one euro , they are very cheap and make amazing mass souvenirs for friends .",1
i regret not buying more .,1
"if you can buy tickets prior , that helps as well .",1
or to montmartre .,1
i had originally planned on buying a skip the line but found none that would allow me to pre purchase a ticket giving summit access .,1
not a cheap visit at 17 euros but when you look at maintenance and operation costs of this magnificent structure it is well worth it .,1
and i even witnessed a proposal ; je t ` aime paris : -rrb-,1
did n't need to go up the tower as it spectacular on its own .,1
"the bottom area is chain link fenced off and there is -lrb- polite -rrb- security to go underneath , and more security to go up .",1
not for the claustrophobic .,1
"have to walk up the eiffel tower , its really nice in autumn .",1
truly breathtaking views !,1
"we also went all the way to the top , amazing and an experience to remember for a life time .",1
our family booked the night ascension up the eiffel tower .,1
"if you do n't want to pay the price or take the time to go up , try the panoramic view from the top of galleries lafayette .",1
only a few people before us in the line for tickets and then it took around 5 min to the first floor were we walked around a bit .,1
we did a river tour and the views of the eiffel were tremendous from the water.quite the gorgeous piece of architectural art and a sight to behold .,1
made reservation online ahead of time and cut the waiting time in half was very impressed by the height it was cloudy and we went all the way to the the very tip of the tower and can honestly say i felt like i was as high as the clouds it was very impressive,1
champane on the top the panorama of the city .,1
"must visit the eiffel tower when you are in paris , dont get off at the first stop on the open top bus get off at the second if you do not intend to go to the top as the better photo opportunities are a little further away",1
there are 3 floors that you can visit .,1
lines going down are much quicker than going up so donn ' t despair !,1
we have total of 2 hours to explored and enjoy the view ...,1
it was a very smooth process and we were able to spend as much time as we liked taking in all the beauty .,1
we ate at jules verne and it was excellent .,1
never been thay excited about visiting a place .,1
i recently went to paris and i must say it is one of the coolest places ever !,1
the first was from trocadero with a stunning view .,1
"make sure you get your picture in front of this during day , and come back at a stroke of the hour at night to see the twinkly lights and your set !",1
sit and have a picnic on the grass with some wine !,1
take in the view .,1
we had the ` picnic chic ' tickets for about 40 euro each .,1
pictures can not and will never capture the beauty and majesty of the eiffel tower .,1
fascinating old cable car carries you up the leg to the first floor where you catch the vertical lift to the top .,1
"what can i say it 's a must do in your life , went five times to paris already and it 's breathtaking whenever i look at it .",1
beautiful as ever but security ment waiting then waiting long waits .,1
"we only went to the 2nd level , but were very happy with that .",1
it is so exiting to visit the wonderful eiffel tower .,1
"although impressive in size , it is n't a beautiful sight .",1
the trip up was easy to the second level but going to the third level had a long line when we first got there at around 5:45 pm .,1
this was at 6 pm and they had just opened .,1
rude is the only word i can use in this case .,1
best to get there early if you want to go to the top as can get crowded .,1
"we then joined a `` skip the line '' tour where a knowledgeable guide took us from the tour agency to the tower , and when seeing the long lines we were glad we 'd purchased the advance tickets .",1
ended up going here on the final day of the visit as a saving the best till last .,1
you should book the ticket online so you do not wait in line .,1
"it 's worth the effort once you are on top of the tower , it is a wonderful experience you will never forget .",1
family of six spit up in late afternoon with plans to meet at 6:00 here .,1
the second was in the evening and it was gorgeous !,1
evening trips are special in their own way and very romantic .,1
it rained heavily when we were there but still it was amazing to be on such a famous landmark .,1
"i was a little worried about heights , but once we got to the top it was all worth it .",1
"there is a small shop selling macaroons there , do try them .",1
we had to wait in long queues for reaching the elevators but once you reach on the top you forget ur struggle n start enjoying the magnificent views of the world 's top city .,1
while in paris on an assignment i had the pleasure and good fortune to visit the eiffel tower .,1
from the second floor you have to take the elevator to the very top .,1
if you can pay extra to get past the crowds i would do so .,1
i wish i 'd enjoyed the place from afar .,1
it 's a nice place to visit if you are in paris in spring & early summer .,1
"there are however hawksters , mostly africans that can be a little aggressive but it 's a non issue .",1
simply amazing !,1
the staff were friendly and helpful but man you tourist got ta lighten up-so stuffy .,1
"i knew the eiffel tower was big , but did n't know it was that big !",1
"vendors selling junk , pick pockets and gypsies carrying clip boards - no thank you .",1
my girlfriend and i decided to walk to the 2nd floor .,1
the third floor is an additional entry fee .,1
we felt sorry for the people waiting in line because it looked like they were going nowhere fast .,1
what a thrill looking out from the top .,1
i recommend this for a first day activity to really get an idea of the layout of the arrondissements .,1
the 3 1/2 hours journey through countryside was amazing .,1
it was worth the wait - even in the cold .,1
went during the day and pleased we went .,1
great cafe at the top .,1
we took the stairs on the way down and it was very worthwhile as it is a great experience !,1
"if you can , do go up the tower as the views are wonderful and there are some nice novelty shops .",1
always love visiting the eiffel tower as one of the best known tourist spots in paris/france .,1
i really enjoyed the eiffel tower .,1
it is super busy and overcrowded .,1
"we had reservations but because we 're expats living abroad , i managed to mess up our phone number in the system and could n't print my tickets .",1
it is a magnificent structure with beautiful views of the city as you climb the levels .,1
"iconic structure , imagined until one sees it in all its glory .",1
i visited the eiffel tower in dec 2015 during the evening .,1
definitely take the time to go to the top for the most amazing views of paris .,1
yet its still something you want to do .,1
seeing the ice rink on the 1st floor was fun !,1
"in the christmas season there is an ice skating rink set up on the lower level with a dj and beautiful lights , quite magical .",1
"not so much the restrooms , but the adjacent sinks .",1
sink areas include windows with a spectacular view .,1
"we were lucky enough to view the tower from land , river , and tour bus .",1
my wife has limited mobility & uses either a wheelchair or mobility scooter so here is our review of the eiffel tower .,1
"recommend going up during the day , especially all the way to the summit , and again in the evening .",1
"we heard a few stories on the long wait to get up to the top of the eiffel tower , but i think we picked a good day .",1
lines for tickets .,1
lots of viewing points to watch and soak up the atmosphere,1
tried to get tickets during the day and would have to wait hours came back at 7 pm and almost no lines for e levators to both levels view of city and river tremendous,1
"however ; we could still go up to the second highest platform where you could still see all of paris anyway , nd they did n't charge the full price , which was good enough for us !",1
small queue and reasonable price .,1
"if you arrive that way , you 'll be able to take some great pics , including selfies with the tower in the background .",1
it cost around 14 euros ticket to reach at top by lift but truly worth,1
you need to pre-book early as the queue is long .,1
if course picture taking was to call for and had to take many as possible .,1
we got to the bottom of eiffel at 8am on a tuesday morning in august .,1
"it was a great experience , but a little disappointing that we traveled thousands of miles and could go to the top .",1
not sure ... what to review about this magnificent piece of history ... make sure you do n't miss the lighting up of the tower in the evening !,1
the spent over an hour here while their parents walked up the tower .,1
you must buy a ticket to the 3d floor and then buy another one to get to the top once you are on the 3d floor .,1
there a lot of people there .,1
"walked up and did n't really need to queue , the climb up can be quite hard but the views are magnificent on a clear day which our visit was .",1
"2nd time to the tower , as usual a long queu but it worth specially if the weather is good .",1
the second time in paris i did go up the eiffel ... n i 'm glad i did .,1
and were so glad .,1
do n't miss this place !,1
"was very enthusiastic to go at the maximum height of the biggest tower , its a very beautiful place .",1
well like everyone else if you go to paris and do n't see the eiffel tower then you have n't seen paris .,1
"you 'll meet lots of people , on the stages up .",1
if you want to go europe then you can not ignore france and if you want to go france then you can not ignore paris and if you are in paris then eiffel tower experience is must .,1
"restaurant , gift shop , toilets and more on the middle floor .",1
access to the 1st floor is only possible on the descent from the 2nd floor and contains the infamous glass walkways which are not for the faint hearted .,1
nothing special in the view from above .,1
the café on the first is fair value for money but the restaurant is not too great .,1
"if you can go on foot until second floor , avoid queue and get cheaper price",1
there were about 20 in our group .,1
it 's amazing to watch .,1
we walked up the first two levels then got the lift to the top .,1
at least once in your life .,1
"book your visit online , then you do n't need to cue .",1
"we did n't , but got there fairly early , and joined the short queue for the stairs .",1
"during the night , it 's something indelible !",1
what would a trip to paris be without visiting it 's most famous monument .,1
if you buy tickets from the gate it will $ 17 for a adult to the 2nd tier by lift kids go for $ 10 .,1
always a pleasure to visit and be amazed by this gem of architecture .,1
"with a picnic blanket to spread on the grass - some bread and cheese to munch on while waiting for sunset to arrive , cherry blossoms in bloom - makes you want to stay and live in paris .",1
what more could a girl want ?,1
get tickets online as early as you can .,1
may wife and i watched the light show at 9pm at the eiffel tower and decided to visit that night since it was a clear evening .,1
we arrived early -lrb- 10ish -rrb- on a sunday morning .,1
visited this place through parisvision travels via expedia .,1
my personal favorite attraction in paris .,1
then you wait for the final elevator .,1
"but when it was created , the parisiens hated it .",1
we went in the lift to the summit .,1
"they pack people in the elevators -lrb- they call them lifts -rrb- , so hang onto your purse , wallet , valuables , etc. .",1
there are some restrictions as to what you can take up and will be searched/checked twice .,1
and eat a crepe in the carroussell across the street .,1
if you go and do n't want to get in a long line make sure you arrive early .,1
nice experience !,1
not so easily done anymore but it 's well worth the visit .,1
it is one of the most visit attraction in paris .,1
it is a must see visit !,1
"we 've seen the eiffel tower before , but this tour gave us a little bit more .",1
a once in a life experince.i had lunch at the eiffel tower.you need to book in advance to be able to get a table with a great view .,1
the ride to the top and again down in the elevator with glass windows to look out is exciting .,1
i hope you will go see this beauty if you ever get the chance !!,1
the land in the back are without quack grass ... the place was amazing with old smile,1
do not get surprised by the length of the lines it is worth to wait,1
the eiffel tower is a must see and definitely worth it - but purchase your elevator tickets from the actual eiffel tower website ahead of time -lrb- like a month or more ahead of time !! -rrb-,1
the views are james bond exciting and national geographic excellent .,1
"the views are breathtaking and the technology of the tower , for its day , a genuine marvel .",1
"cost is $ 17 euros to ride to the top , about 1/2 that for kids 12 and under .",1
"we did n't go up or inside , because the lines or extremely long and it 's so crowded i feel it would n't be worth it really .",1
pictures do not o it justice .,1
every few minutes the lights would flicker .,1
"obviously , you ca n't miss a trip to the eiffel tower .",1
once inside we waited our turn -lrb- reserved time on ticket -rrb- & went in reserved ticket line & we got up there via the 2 elevators to the summit .,1
"yes , it can get crowded , but the views are worth it .",1
climb is straightforward but there is some effort required !,1
visiting at 9:30 pm and were able to see the views and lights of the tower at the same time .,1
"it 's very romantic , offers great views of the city and just everything i thought it would be .",1
this is where the ticket office is to walk up the tower .,1
really enjoyed on top of the eiffel tower but only because we pre booked -lrb- star tours -rrb- - an absolutely must - did it on a very hot day - probably a little more enjoyable on a slightly cooler day - well worth worth booking in advance it saves your time as we booked tour so tour company took care of those things .,1
worth seeing both day and night to see it all lit up .,1
"seeing this icon a memory not to be forgotten , value for money given the memories you will walk away with",1
over this tower paris is at your sight and you can see all the famous sightseeing from above,1
we only got up to the restaurant level but that was more than enough for us to get the feel for the tower .,1
the eiffel tower is truly a paris treasure ❤,1
get there early because queues are long .,1
"get in line early afternoon in summer months , but time it to be on top a night for the lights and cooler weather .",1
"go to the observatory floor , you wo n't regret the views .",1
awesome view over the city of paris .,1
"do n't book in advance , as you still have to queue to use the lifts to get to the various levels .",1
i can offer this bit of advice ... prepare to stand in long lines to go up unless you purchase your tickets on line in advance .,1
we bought ` skip-the-line ' tickets as part of a tour package and was glad we did - queued for less than 10 minutes .,1
you can take the elevator down or take the stairs .,1
was very reasonably priced and they had a great time !,1
"you 'll get a great view from the 2nd floor ... next time , i 'll be sure to visit at night .",1
i do n't even have to say it but you just can not miss this incredible beauty while in paris .,1
was a dream to visit the eiffel tower since childhood .,1
she would n't allow us to bring in empty water bottles .,1
"at the end , it had the colors of portugal as they had won yesterday 's game .",1
think of paris think of the eiffel tower .,1
you are not in paris unless you visit the eiffel tower especially when the sun is setting the the tower dances happily in light fantastic .,1
the eiffel tower was an amazing experience !!,1
"furthermore , you can not possibly imagine the size of it until you are physically there ... it is huge !",1
"the best advise i can share is to go online and make a reservation , you skip the line , and that will improve your visit .",1
floor to the top .,1
"yes you visited paris so you have to do it , unfortunately it costs a lot , takes a minimum of 30 mins in line for 10 mins of beautiful views , then another line to get back down",1
we arrived at 7 in the evening and stayed there till 11 .,1
we decided to buy the ticket to the very top .,1
its such a iconic structure and its reputation makes it part of most peoples bucket list ... we visited in day but came back later to go till the 2nd level in night ... the light show is amazing ... it was really a worth cherishing memory,1
"it is great to visit , we love this place , the atmosphere is quite unique with heaps of friendly people , though the vendors are sometimes annoying .",1
its a wonder of the world for a reason .,1
we avoided the queues by going up the stairs to the second floor .,1
but the lines are too big and the price to get up are too expensive .,1
the lineups here are pretty big so i 'd highly recommend doing something like this to save time .,1
there were great foods which affordable .,1
"the iron girders made me feel quite intimidated , and i would not advise you look down until you get to a storey .",1
the views from the very top are commanding and is quite frankly breath taking .,1
you need to go to the eiffel tower if you have kids with you .,1
"if possible , try to book in advance .",1
take the elevator to the top and stairs down !,1
do n't talk to the ladies with the clipboards .,1
"wines , fashion and women .",1
much of the ticket allowance is bought by agents .,1
you will enjoy the view and the architecture of the tower in detail .,1
can say i have done it now .,1
the eiffel tower lives up to it 's name of being an iconic attraction .,1
i loved being in the eiffel tower .,1
i never understood all the fuss about the eiffel tower until walking towards it !,1
if you are looking for a magnificent views and a great time .,1
by the time i made it to the midlevel at 600 ft i was content to stay there and the views were perfect .,1
"the tower is easier to find from far , and you can enjoy many views as you walk around there .",1
"i 'm petrified of heights , and i managed .",1
"quite rightly , it is a magnificent sight .",1
see it at night also when the lighting on it changes colors .,1
what we enjoyed the most about visiting the tower was walking around the great neighborhood which surrounds the tower .,1
pre-book your tickets to avoid the queues .,1
worth while to go for old style romantic people .,1
so we waited in line with the rest .,1
"we viewed the eiffel tower from the hop on hop off bus , from across the seine and stood underneath the magnificent structure .",1
you can either take the lift -lrb- which generally has a long queue -rrb- or climb up the stairs -lrb- which is a better experience -rrb- .,1
only managed part of the way up as it was a sunny day and the queues for the top meant they 'd stopped selling any more tickets .,1
i gasped and grabbed his arm .,1
it is the most renowned tourist attraction in europe and going to the top of the tower provides a 360 degree view of the entire city .,1
not a nice thing to do when it is raining !,1
nice atmosphere and took time to enjoy each level .,1
"14 $ to take the elevator , better to spend this amount on a rivercruise .",1
the crowds are there but not a hassle ... .,1
relatively inexpensive considering the wonderful views and couple of hours rest in the middle of a very busy day .,1
it 's worth the price .,1
lots of pick pockets at the bottom so be careful .,1
after dark it 's lit up and on the hour it `` sparkles '' .,1
"this is the definitive icon most people identify with paris , and deservedly so .",1
"once on the first floor , it is still crowded , which does not contribute to a feeling of safety .",1
one of the best meals i 've ever had .,1
"we loved our visit of the eiffel tower , amazing views of paris from the second floor , no need to go up higher .",1
it was a bit rainy and super windy so only went to the second level .,1
"try to catch the `` sparkling eiffel tower '' which runs at 10 pm , 11 pm and 12 midnight for 5 mins each .",1
i also suggest pre-booking in advance .,1
"everyone has seen it in photos , but in real , it is really something !",1
"to see this magnificent structure in person was more better then i thought , and night time is the best time .",1
go see it !,1
i wo n't go into details of how wonderful the place was etc etc. .,1
but luckily weather is not for sale : -rrb-,1
great view even we had bad weather .,1
i would recommend booking a tour in advance to miss the queues and go in the evening to watch the sun set .,1
"we waited over an hour in line to go up , and another hour to come down .",1
"if you 're in good shape , i recommend it .",1
best time to visit in evening .,1
the security had been upped to enter which is a great feeling as you feel safe .,1
"on her birthday 7th march , we went to the eiffel tower .",1
"it was sort of an organized chaos , and the queue was pretty long to wait for the elevator .",1
"even you have been there before , you must go to the eiffel tower .",1
really glad we did this and would definitely recommend it .,1
"if this is your first time in paris , you should definitely visit this tower .",1
visiting this place is like a dream come true for me .,1
you can get tickets online that will save you from standing in line .,1
this a very inexpensive activity !,1
if you want to propose to your girlfriend there is not a best place on hearth .,1
it is indeed very beautiful .,1
people get rude and inconsideration especially when trying to squeeze into the elevators on the way down -lrb- not good if tight spots are a problem for you -rrb- .,1
we went to see the effiel tower at night .,1
"love the eiffel tower , we did n't go up it this time but you need to see it close up and from a distance .",1
i just fall in love with you every time visiting : -rrb-,1
"when you have on mind that tower is trademark of city , you should visit it , but after you visit all others beautiful attractions .",1
so plan adequately .,1
the weather was great and we couldnt have asked for a better trip on such short notice .,1
you can see quite a ways out from 1060 feet high .,1
"went at 1130 , went to the very top , no wait for the second elevator either !",1
it is difficult to make your way through this to get near to the tower and you definitely need to hold onto your belongings .,1
"the one and only in the world ; great history , lots of work to keep it in good condition by painting it every seven years , a beautiful monument in the heart of paris !",1
we went up around 8 pm and came down when the tower was closing .,1
it has always been my dream to see the famous eiffel tower .,1
this is like the ultimate erector set !,1
"leaving by champs de mars , you get fantastic views of the tower in the morning -lrb- sun is in the right position -rrb- .",1
went back at night to see the lights .,1
this spectacular structure dominates the skyline in paris although it is frequently hidden from view in the side streets .,1
"be careful though , there 's just so much nuisances and it actually took the fun in enjoying our vacation .",1
you must try a macaroon while you 're there !,1
"however ... at night when it 's lights come on , the light show is amazing .",1
i have been up the eiffel tower many times over the years and it never fails to amaze .,1
"when you arrive at the champ de mars and look at the tour eiffel , you just don ´ t believe ... that was my feeling !",1
great set up they have .,1
i 'm glad that we did it in the end .,1
we also wanted to see it at night .,1
do n't visit paris without seeing the eiffel tower !,1
enjoy the view and drink something in the chill zone at one of the platforms .,1
our family saw and did tons of things on our trip but at the end everyone said this was their favorite thing we did over the course of our 10 day trip across europe .,1
the eiffel tower if one of the most majestic landmarks in the world .,1
"i came this time with my family , but seriously , the queues and crowds killed it .",1
who knew 4 year olds and a 10 year old would enjoy doing this so much !!,1
"security was kind of a pain , but is our world",1
we were not allowed to go up until 2 o'clock .,1
do n't show up and expect no line .,1
it was a great experience to see paris from top .,1
"the most visited , paid tourist spot in the world , if you are in paris , it 's a must see .",1
try and beat the ques by being early and be careful of choosing the stair climbing route .,1
the one and only place to visit in france .,1
we were inside in 15 minutes .,1
"i did n't go to the top , so i ca n't say if that 's worth it .",1
the view is just amazing and the history is touchable .,1
the tour guide was great she knew what she was talking about while being funny at the same time .,1
security to get to the base of the tower was tight and detracted from the experience a bit -lrb- but i understand the necessity for it -rrb- .,1
but tickets online beforehand or face standing in long lines .,1
unfortunately this time i was unable to go up to the top due to some mechanical problem .,1
i have to say ... totally different look ... absolutely brightly and flashily tower shined all the paris : -rrb-,1
"however , the eiffel tower & the seine river cruise did not disappoint us at all .",1
best to go in early spring to avoid the huge crowds .,1
public toilets are available but not easy to find .,1
our guide did point out several different icons and we ended up going to notre dame later that afternoon .,1
if the weather is perfect and the weekend the tower is crazy .,1
it is must visit for all visitors visiting paris .,1
the view is spectacular from all levels .,1
it also looks very impressive if it is visited from cruise in seine river .,1
we purchased our tickets on line and we 're able to get to the site early enough to arrange window seats .,1
"surprisingly , as we visited one night after dinner , there was a very small line and tickets were obtained on the spot ... so do n't entirely give up hope !",1
"we booked tickets a week ahead , so we did n't have to wait very long .",1
if you have n't been there it 's like you 've not been in paris .,1
so we took our chances and went in the morning .,1
you will find many females trying to get your email id and some donation in the form of money for some international organization .,1
so it kind of threw me off my guard as to enjoying the tower itself .,1
it is an impressive structure from near or far and the view up top is incredible .,1
it 's worth waiting as long as an hour or so just to go see it .,1
worth every cent - and get the pass at the air port too and get past all the ticket lines .,1
there 's a reason it 's 1 of the 7 modern wonders of the world .,1
on top of your must see in a lifetime .,1
the elevator ride was pretty quick and you can see out as your travel up .,1
what an amazing day out .,1
it a bit of a bummer to have to commit to a time and date to visit .,1
maybe that was the issue - too much anticipation .,1
"with the climb of a small step , you can go outside again .",1
there are 3 levels to check out .,1
i really enjoyed also seeing it from the river perspective .,1
the views were amazing and we were lucky with the weather .,1
all around the tour eiffel is also nice,1
the lines were long but that 's to bee expected and it goes quick !,1
standing under the tower or going all the way up to get a view of the city .,1
it was n't too crowded so we didnt wait long to get back down .,1
its nice to have a long walk in that park .,1
"it would have been nice to reach the upper floors and see why at the time it was constructed , it really reflected france as a center of the industrial world .",1
`` la vielle dame '' it 's a must to see every time i go to paris !,1
you wo n't disappointed .,1
the view is totally romantic .,1
when in paris you have to do the eiffel tower they said .,1
i highly recommend dining at restaurant 54 on the 1st floor .,1
you ca n't go to paris and not go see the eiffel tower ...,1
"it was beautiful , and near the top of each evening the tower is lit with a sparkle effect and shimmers on the seine .",1
this is a number one on the must see list .,1
the other side was breezy but ok .,1
"views are awesome , lines are long .",1
great view - would not have missed going for anything .,1
it was worth queueing for almost an hour and a half to see the incredible view of the city from the tower 's summit .,1
as you climb ...,1
pd : i strongly recommend to make a. .,1
it was huge and beautiful .,1
an amazing view for 17 euro .,1
take a video of view .,1
the views from the 4th level are breathtaking .,1
the eiffel tower is a really great construction .,1
not very clear what queue to join but basically any will do .,1
it 's a must do - i did n't do it when i visited in 2003 and regretted it until returning this year .,1
it is most famous tower in the world .,1
but it 's very crowd in all time .,1
walk under it .,1
do not miss this .,1
"if you could not find tickets online , keep checking back like i did because certain time slot might become available and you never know , you may get lucky : -rrb-",1
what amazed me most was the structure up close .,1
"we did not , however , climb to the top !",1
with convenient metro and rer stops it is easy to get to and the restaurants in the neighborhoods surrounding are delightful .,1
"to make the most of your tour , try to plan your visit just before dusk so you can see the city by day light , then watch the lights coming on and enjoy the city by night .",1
it just looks marvellous in the night when its lit up .,1
beware of all the vendors ...,1
people watching is great .,1
not much to say .,1
we walked up which was the best way to see it all .,1
bring your binocular if you have any !,1
my partner and i had never visited france before so when we booked our visit the eiffel tower was on the top of our list of places to visit and things to see .,1
we have a few friends who had already been and all said not to waste our time with it but we wanted to make our opinion .,1
"it 's extremely eye catching and at night , it 's lit up very nicely .",1
before i have seen from flight but to see in real and front of it was amazing experience .,1
we were allowed to go up to the second floor only .,1
you can not leave paris without a visit to the eiffel tower .,1
probably on of the most photographed places on earth .,1
the eiffel tower is spectacular when lit up and for 5 minutes every half hour until 12.45 pm it literally twinkles with lights !,1
beware of pick-pocketers and street hawkers .,1
we planned ahead and purchased tickets to this iconic landmark ahead of time directly from the eiffel tower website .,1
has a certain beauty about it and especially when you see the tower up close .,1
followed the advise to travel weekdays on a wednesday bought tickets on site in 5 minutes and was up in the summit in 15 more .,1
i actually preferred the views from around the eiffel tower as opposed to the ones i got from inside .,1
a timeless masterpiece of architecture .,1
do n't miss the merry go round across the street .,1
was $ 66 too much for six of us to go to the top of the tower by lift ?,1
seeing it all lit up is absolutely unforgettable .,1
make sure you try your best to visit the eiffel tower when in paris .,1
my father travelled to paris before i was born .,1
"you should book the ticket online , especially if you wan na go on top .",1
we found a nice grassy spot to sit for a while and have a snack .,1
"although the lines to actually view paris from the tower may be quite long , it is definitely worth it .",1
i would suggest booking on the day or when you know that the sky will be clear .,1
views are stunning on a clear day .,1
they do the light show at night which is magical .,1
it 's great night or day .,1
when i was there it was foggy and so i decided not to climb up .,1
it 's so pretty ... but only romantic once you have walked away .,1
"it 's incredible , but you really need to be on the watch for scams and pick pockets .",1
"in october 2013 , i got to see it illuminated and sparkle during my evening bike tour around paris .",1
i bet everyone will like to visit this icon .,1
yes its a good view .,1
always crowded lots of tourists .,1
this was one of the main attractions that i planned by europe trip for .,1
"went on a monday afternoon and there were almost no lines -lrb- except from the 2nd to 3rd floor , since you ca n't take the stairs from there -rrb- .",1
took my love to the top of the tower the night of valentines day .,1
"a quick stop off for wine and fondue after , and it was a night we will always cherish .",1
would advise walking up on a day when the weather is neither wet or too hot as is not hard going .,1
i would suggest brining a blanket and having a picnic on the gardens surrounding the tower .,1
"impossible to visit paris and not wander down to the beautiful eiffel tower - a true icon , and just as striking as you 'd imagine .",1
we went during the days and at night .,1
an experience that made it all worth while for a once in a lifetime trip .,1
take the suway to trocadero station and have a big picture of the tower before you go up .,1
wikipedia had tons more info .,1
"it was quite an experience , as i had read the book , eiffel 's tower and was interested in the way they ended up arranging the different sections of the elevator .",1
"undoubtedly if you are among those romantic dreamy ones , then you must have dreamt to be on top of eiffel tower with your partner .",1
"street vendors were selling in the market on the way to the tower and i was able to buy some mini eiffel tower souvenirs , even one that lights up .",1
it was also my first time going to the top of the tower and gave an amazing view of the whole of paris .,1
"if you are there in the daytime , grab a bottle of wine and some snacks and have a nice picnic on the champ de mars -lrb- the field between the eiffel tower and the ecole militaire .",1
"it 's beautiful and romantic , -lrb- if you can stop taking pictures -rrb- !",1
loved the view and the information from the tour guide was actually quite interesting and she made it short and funny -lrb- as well as optional to follow along - you could stay with her or go your own way once you were on the tower -rrb- .,1
a must do activity for anyone visiting paris .,1
the view and crowds were better at the top of the arch .,1
you can stand there and look at the view forever .,1
my husband and daughter went up - was really cheap to do so .,1
it was getting toward sunset and the views everywhere you turned were spectacular .,1
if you 're able i highly recommend taking the stairs .,1
"and , in the evening on the grass before the twinkling light show at 10pm , they pepper you with `` beer , wine , cigarettes '' nonstop !",1
my daughter and her friend were free !,1
"due to security measures , there can be long lines .",1
went with family .,1
"alexandra was great , but i am sure the rest of their staff is very well-trained and capable .",1
the queues for unreserved tickets were horrible so again well worth pre booking .,1
but beware - its crowded .,1
the great place of paris .,1
most .,1
and a glass of champagne on the top,1
if you are planning in advance try to score a reservation at the restaurant .,1
the lights at night are amazing .,1
the eiffel tower is stunning and needs to be visited and experienced .,1
"walked here from the hotel , beautiful at sunset and at night .",1
"i would like to add that it should be a mustx2 because it is a must during the day time , and of course , make sure to see it from both sides - champ de mars and the trocadero .",1
again not true .,1
~ grab some food and head her to sit on the grass .,1
during our visit we lined up for 45 minutes for tickets to the top and could only get to the 2nd platform where we lined again for the summit .,1
we bought tickets for the top at the second level and did not have a long wait for the elevator .,1
the eiffel tower is my absolute favorite structure .,1
since i was little i always wanted to come see this ... it feels so surreal .,1
if you cross the river and head into the trocadero gardens your photos will have the eiffel tower reflected in the water fountains,1
"although one pays a substantial premium for the fact that one is on the first etage of the eiffel tower , the view is absolutely stunning and the food more than sufficiently parisian to meet most levels of demand .",1
my whole life i wanted to see it !,1
"my boyfriend lost 20 euros to them ; 10 to a ` disability ' charity , who made you sign a home made petition style board , and then snatched money out my hand .",1
very crowded of course but worth it if you 've never done it .,1
problem around the tower are the thousand street sellers and scamists that lure trying to get people 's money .,1
"by purchasing timed entry tickets , we avoided the 90 minute lines .",1
definitely something you have to do .,1
would have been nice if they let tou know this before waiting in line for so long .,1
"was bothered by lots of people selling alcohol around eiffel tower , this should n't be allowed .",1
it is a mandantory place to visit for every steampunk enthusiast : -rrb-,1
have visited this place before but we went back last july as my san didnt remember the last visit as he was too young .,1
make sure you go when the tower has its sparkling lights on .,1
"i would book some kind of `` skip the line '' pass or ticket , i did and it saved me a lot of time .",1
"i was on an exchange to france , and my host family took me to paris .",1
absolutely fab !,1
buy tickets online to avoid long queues .,1
"stay away from any groups of young soliciting that they are good samaritans , be cautious of them .",1
get a blanket and a small picnic and watch the twinkling lights .,1
waited about an hour to get tickets .,1
"but , do n't get trapped into the many kitschy tourist traps like eating in the restaurant .",1
"you have to take one of the 4 elevators from the middle to the top , you ca n't walk it , so if you can buy the elevator ticket at the bottom when you buy the stairs ticket , do it .",1
wished we had just enjoyed the illuminated view from our hotel as it was a lot of effort to get tube there and walk .,1
being that it was the christmas period there was lovely food stalls and christmas trees .,1
"once on second floor , the view is really mesmerizing and the view from top floor -lrb- sommet -rrb- , i really ca n't describe in words .",1
we did not go up due to one more reason as we had seen the paris skyline from sacre-coeur and sadly did not like it .,1
this was not my first time to the eiffel tower and it was amazing this time just like the first time !,1
it does cost extra to go to the summit and you can buy a ticket from the midlevel if you do n't want to decide until part way up .,1
been to paris for the second time .,1
"once the tower is lit up , it is magnificent and warming .",1
every hour on the hour it twinkles for 5 minutes .,1
i tried to buy tickets online a month in advance and we could n't get any .,1
loved every minute of this majestic monument !,1
we were there during the day and we had wanted to go up inside but the line was long and it was hot .,1
line really was n't that bad .,1
a dinner in the ship during the cruise ... .,1
walking up to the eiffel tower you are in awe .,1
none of the pictures portray its true beauty and how huge it is !!,1
"the lines to get to the top are very long so i did not bother , but from the ground the view is also amazing as the tower looks so monumental and you can really appreciate all the intricate detail of the construction .",1
"book in advance to avoid the queues opened in 1889 , it is 300m tall and offers pretty good views of the city from its heights .",1
"since both of us had been here many years ago , and went to the top , we decided to just view the tower from below and from the adjacent park .",1
what a wonder !,1
instead head to the stairs only ticket booth .,1
"a selfie with this metallic wonder is a must :d to avoid long queues , please book online in advance .",1
"this is a must see in daylight and again after dark , when the tower is lit .",1
"even though the crowds are infernal and champs de mars looks like being burned , the splendour of the tower can not be denied .",1
love the scale and engineering but spoilt by massive queues and uninterested staff .,1
i visited paris with my wife for our honeymoon .,1
and also i was warned of too many pic pockets .,1
so here 's so advice to enjoy it .,1
the eiffel tower is everything that you 'd expect and more .,1
the history of the eiffel tower is very interesting .,1
we had booked ahead online and that turned out to be a very smart move !,1
make sure you take a close look at the tower lower supports and see all the workmanship and details that went into this marvelous structure .,1
after that you make you own way - ahead of thousands in the queue .,1
the lift took only 2 minutes .,1
only a fool can agree to pay money for spending 3 hours waiting in line and being shoved around like cattle .,1
suggest visiting,1
one of those things you just have to do .,1
"we bought tickets to the summit and you get a great view of the city , from both the second floor and the summit .",1
the facilities were good and since the street traders were not allowed into the area it was a pleasant experience,1
blown away by this as always .,1
you can book tickets up to 3 months in advance .,1
we had the opportunity to walk up the stairs to the lower observation level -lrb- that was an experience -rrb- .,1
"excellent view of the siene great food and wine , our evening out also included a boat ride .",1
"great monument , the best in paris !",1
"i did n't have energy to wait in the line to go up the tower after a long day in versaille , however i found the park in front of it really amazing with all those people having fun there .",1
fantastic experience !,1
"it was even more spectacular at night , and the view from the second and third level was just amazing !",1
"paris lies before you , the viewing platforms are not overcrowded , and they have efficient and polite security and lift staff .",1
"it is the tallest structure in paris and has maintained this distinction as there is a building height restriction , allowing fabulous sweeping views .",1
not the best experience when traveling with a four year old .,1
which gets quite busy .,1
go early in the morning to avoid a long line to enter and pass through security .,1
spectacular views .,1
it 's touristy ; it 's gimmicky ; it 's grand .,1
this was during paris 's high pollution so public transport was busier .,1
"after 90000 reviews , i 'm not sure what i can add - it was stunning !",1
"we had great view from the tower , we were there in the evening , we seen a great lighting of paris as well after the light on tower view is so great .",1
way too touristy .,1
it was busy but we got in fairly quickly .,1
truly a mesmerising sight !,1
the surrounding area was terrific and when the lights twinkle at night you just ca n't help but stare .,1
i remember going on a school trip in year 8 and thinking how amazing the site of seeing the eiffel tower for the first time was .,1
you wo n't regret it !,1
the eiffel tower is good to see in life .,1
"although always crowded , take the time to visit even if you do n't manage to go up to the observation deck !",1
went up to the second floor with amazing views and was tempted to go to the top as they had a champagne bar and found out they sold it on the second floor as well .,1
amazing views and a true sense of becoming a part of history when you ascend this iconic structure .,1
"beautiful and majestic , you must go up to the top to appreciate the eiffel tower !",1
but yes just try to pre-book your tickets to the top online as the waiting down can be really tiring and will eat up your precious time in paris when you actually wish to make the most of it .,1
but that 's why you 're in paris .,1
i suggest buying the skip the line ticket .,1
"people here are like in a dream world , so mesmerized by the tower .",1
be aware that due to security reasons the lines are very very long .,1
its worth it to go all the way to the summit,1
go all the way around the top and read the history of the tower as it was built and visited by so many world leaders throughout the years .,1
got to the top in under an hour .,1
"we loved the views from the ower at the top , it 's beautiful when the sun is just starting to fade .",1
"beautiful at night but you can appreciate the workmanship during the day , lets be honest if your visiting paris you do n't need my opinion to see the eiffel tower !",1
"the eiffel tower is one of those attractions that you always think about seeing , but do n't realise how spectacular it is until you 've been there .",1
love the eiffel tower and it feels magical just being there .,1
my friend brought me to have a look of the eiffel tower from a distance .,1
we got the early one .,1
was slightly confused as no one could tell me why and we could still see people going up and coming out .,1
"it moves fast , and you will get the right to say to your relatives and friends : `` i was there - on the very top '' .",1
we did n't buy tickets beforehand so we stood in another line for 5 minutes by one of the pillars to get tickets to the top on the lift for $ 17 .,1
our favourite thing we enjoy doing up the tower is watching the sunset - just sitting and relaxing watching the sun drop down behind the buildings and then the tower lights come on - magical !,1
my friends and i had the most wonderful time .,1
it 's such an impressive structure which stands elegantly on the river bank towering over the city of lights .,1
i have no words to express how amazing is the eiffel tower !,1
"there were a lot of guys trying to sell bottles of wine and champagne to the few tourists out there , do n't buy them .",1
fantastic views of the whole of paris .,1
amazing sight to see in paris !,1
the eiffel tower was more than we could imagine .,1
we took the skip the line paid tour but in june this was not necessary -lrb- not worth the money we paid -rrb- .,1
my goal was to see the city of lights .,1
very little trouble and the police were very vigilant .,1
beware of pick pockets on the elevators -lrb- signs are even posted !! -rrb-,1
loved visiting this attraction ... .,1
"yes , it is a piece of junk but beautifully crafted .",1
now onto the lesser impressive parts .,1
"its better to just look at the blinking lights rather then going to click photos , enjoy the view rather than photos .",1
at first i was slightly skeptical about going to the top floor however it is a must !,1
"fyi , it happens every hour at night for 5 min .",1
"was in paris for work , and how could i miss a visit to eiffel tower !",1
its so high its will take your breath away when you get to the top !,1
"but since this is the epitome of beauty of paris , you cant ignore this place .",1
"but i must confess , the experience of being infront of it esp .",1
i took the elevator to the summit .,1
it is worth staying up for,1
very busy in the mornings order tickets on line,1
i almost did not go up on the tower thinking it was not that big of a deal ... so glad i did !,1
recommend getting there as early as you can and taking the steps up if able .,1
"the view from the top is breathtaking and , on a clear day , you can see the whole city !",1
"on a massive plus point however , the eiffel tower comes alive at night - the show starts at 8pm with illuminations that are awesome !",1
highly recommend watching the evening light show it on every hour .,1
i didnt know it did that !,1
"do n't stop or engage them , it 's all a scam .",1
the views from the top are breath taking !,1
the queue to get up to the summit was n't too bad we waited maybe 20min .,1
"beautiful lit up a night , with blinking lights every 5 minutes .",1
it was really beautiful despite the fog .,1
"at night , the tower twinkles in lights at every hour on the hour .",1
we stayed through late afternoon through dusk till night and thoroughly enjoyed the city transform into a sparkling landscape .,1
its so huge and looks awesome .,1
brilliant experience !!,1
you get a certain level of expectation and it matches it .,1
well organised .,1
watch your purse and wallets .,1
we decided to take the elevator instead .,1
"we bought our tickets to the top , way in advance .",1
we got there first thing in the morning which is what i highly recommend any travel or to do to avoid the extremely long lines .,1
monumental tower in paris .,1
"the elevator is well worth taking , although it is packed .",1
come in the evenings for the spectacular lights !,1
nice view but the same can be experienced from the sacre coeur .,1
but much better pincio balcony in rome .,1
the place was packed with people although we visited on a week day and the grounds are particularly littered .,1
"if someone approaches you with a clipboard , do n't let them or their kids near you .",1
you simply can not go to paris and not see the eiffel tower up close !,1
there is also a light coming from it which shines around paris .,1
i was interested and overwhelmed by the engineering effort of the structure design .,1
pictures will never do it justice .,1
the view from the top of the tower at night is unparallelled .,1
we were staying in the 5th arrondissement so less than a k away was the eiffel tower .,1
"be very careful with your belongings , there are pickpockets and scammers galore !",1
"i thought it would be lame because it was such a massive touristy thing to do , but when we walked up to the structure , i was in awe , and i insisted we go to the top .",1
the lines were just too long .,1
if you 're luckily you might be able to use the stairs in between .,1
organised a surprise dinner for my husband and son whilst visiting paris to the eiffel tower with dinner on the first floor restaurant and it was amazing and memorable .,1
we left after half an hour of the queue not moving at all as we were on a short stay in paris and had to forego this in order to see everything else .,1
the tower looks different when you see it in the night and in the day .,1
recommend the elevator up and stairs down .,1
nothing compares to site view from the top of the the eiffel tower simply outstanding .,1
its was raining when we went to eiffel tower but we had the life time experience .,1
if possible do book tickets in advance to save some time .,1
this truly is a must-see if you are in paris .,1
the eiffel tower is amazing and offers excellent views of paris .,1
even hardened parisiens stop and stare .,1
"the view from the top is spectacular , but expect to be squished in a permanent line-up from the bottom to the top and back down again .",1
probably every child in the world knows the eiffel tower ?,1
"book lunch at 58 eiffel , which will help shorten the queue for the lift to the fist floor .",1
"possibly the very first landmark one seeks out on visiting paris , this iconic attraction does not disappoint , particularly at night , viewed from a boat ride on the seinne , when it is lit up and sparkles like a giant christmas tree !",1
definitely go back at night to see how beautiful the tower is all light up .,1
i was floored by the size and scope of the tower .,1
suggestion : book tickets before if you 'd like to avoid long lines .,1
"if you travel to paris , you should visit the eiffel tower , and get to the top of paris .",1
we went to the top and the view was so breathtaking !,1
we spent a bit of time in the immediate area before going through the security checks and up the tower .,1
"there are two floors , you pay for the first floor at the bottom and if you 're brave enough you can pay to go to the tip of the tower .",1
my teenager of a son told me he would come back with his family someday .,1
at night it lights up and when dark it sparkles for 5 minutes each hour from 9pm .,1
we spent a memorable afternoon at this iconic paris landmark .,1
i love you,1
and i was wrong .,1
"such an icon of france , and visible from a lot of the city , the eiffel tower is a must see destination for all .",1
the staff there are professional and the view from the tower is breathtaking .,1
"however , this is the first time i saw it at night .",1
"even if you do n't want to go up , definitely come to see it up close ; you wo n't regret it !",1
22000 led lights flash for 5 minutes at the top of each hour .,1
we went to visit the eiffel tower on christmas .,1
the only unfortunate thing at the moment is the quite understandable high levels of security - it does mean long waits as you pass through two security checkpoints .,1
it 's the photo that you want so go enjoy and admire .,1
afterwards we decided to walk down to the eiffel tower -lrb- about a 5min walk -rrb- and pay for a visit to the top floor .,1
for 10 euro i got to the second level of the tower by the elevator .,1
also avoid tea time unless you 've booked - we were there for 17:00 and did n't get up and back down until 20:30 !,1
ok so my wife and i did a bit of research beforehand .,1
i ca n't stress the beauty at night .,1
"you can purchase them online too , but you have to do that in advance .",1
i would recommend this but prebook .,1
there are gift shops on the upper levels and the lines to purchase can be long .,1
we pre-booked our visit .,1
"easy to walk to from the train station , just ignore the `` vendors '' trying to sell junk all around the beautiful and amazing eiffel tower .",1
"it 's just beautiful , and well worth doing .",1
"with security on high alert , there are control points you must enter and clear prior to being allowed near the tower .",1
"make sure a book ahead of time , so you have the exact time to just cut thru thise waiting to buy their tickets !",1
"from there , you must take the lift to the top , but that is not obligatory .",1
it is best to have reservations as there are long lineups .,1
we purchased our tickets prior which i highly recommend .,1
"advice : definitely , absolutely , positively , by all means get a ticket on line and avoid the lines !",1
"felt treated like cattle , moved from one place to the next ... .",1
so much is happening at the tower .,1
great views of the city on a good day .,1
it 's fun to go up by lift then go down by stairs .,1
"originally the parisians thought it looked like asparagus , but have grown to love the iron lady .",1
all in all i recommend the visit but only from ground level .,1
good but far too many people - upper level closed due to congestion and lower levels heading the same way .,1
though security was tight but polite .,1
cost was not bad if you paid at the gate not skip the line people .,1
the grass on the champ de mars -lrb- opposite the eiffel tower is in dire need of care -rrb- .,1
"however , it 's a definite must-do highlight of paris and the kids loved it !",1
came last night song was so busy and seems to be lots of men selling cheap stuff everywhere !,1
go !,1
very disappointed .,1
took almost 3 hours .,1
it is easy to take breaks along the way if needed .,1
"if you feel athletic , you can climb up the stairs uptil the second floor , if not , take lifts .",1
"also , the eiffel tower is lit up and the lights flash at night too.this restaurant is all about the presentation.i had never used a fork and knife that were long and narrow .",1
we were with a tour and did not get to go to the top .,1
the photos from the 2 ` nd level are quite ok .,1
"a wonderful venue to watch euro cup , very tight security .",1
is it worth going up ?,1
"panoramic view of sparkling , dancing of paris is magnificent , especially in a cold dark night .",1
"the macaroons on the 2nd floor were really good , i recommend the chocolate and the salted caramel .",1
"what a beautiful site , loved at night when the lights go crazy .",1
"we did n't go up , too many queues and standing beneath just looked like a tower of rusty girders .",1
"i have seen this in the day in high and low seasons and it is grande , but nothing compares to seeing this at night .",1
most romantic and greatest place in the world .,1
it was originally built for the 1889 world 's fair and was not intended to be permanent .,1
there was also restrooms on the second floor as well as souvenirs for sale .,1
we did n't get the opportunity to go up the tower but we did walk under it .,1
"fantastic structure , must visit in the day time and at night as well .",1
there was a huge queue to go up but i think they had stopped people from doing so .,1
could see the views from every stop .,1
"can you imagine visiting the magical paris without going to the iconic eifel tower ... every time we visit , is like the first time ... once again , we had an amazing time and great food with a stunning view ... love you paris ... a tres bientot !!!!!",1
queues and queues ... but nothing to distract or read or watch .,1
you can even buy a glass of champagne at the top at a reasonable price .,1
"views from first , second , and third floors were really beautiful and the city was amazing from this perspective .",1
this is the most attractive place in paris for tourist but need to visit it once time in life .,1
pre booked tickets with fat tire tours so no waiting .,1
"we had a great tour of the tower , all the way to the top level at 281metres !",1
"went during the day and then went up in the evening , the views are amazing .",1
the iconic eiffel tower was the highlight of my 12-hour parisian walking tour last month .,1
will come back with family,1
from the lower observation deck you take the elevator the rest of the way up .,1
i got a selfie stick for 5 euro instead of 15 .,1
we found that there are several play areas around the tower for little people that was a good fit for our family .,1
the room it was in had been locked but we easily found a security man to open it for us .,1
"the top was closed , so we were let out at the 2nd level .",1
beware of pickpockets !!,1
glad i did it once .,1
i believe that love is an answer to any question .,1
would recommend to pre book before visit .,1
it 's been a while since i last went up and back then there was no fear .,1
"if you go in the winter do n't bother doing the pre - booked experience , it costs a fortune !",1
"get the lift to the top , at night .",1
the eiffel tower is the eiffel tower after all .,1
"you know you are in paris , when you see the eiffel tower towering above you .",1
start from summit & work your way down .,1
overall a very lovely experience .,1
keep your valuables close and do n't photograph the many immigrants selling trinkets under the tower .,1
"to avoid this you could book one of the many 2 hour guided tours advertised that do get you in quicker and take you to the 2nd level , where you are left to join the queue to get to the 3rd level .",1
we could see so much from every vantage point of this amazing structure .,1
wanted to do the ice skating at the bottom level but had not booked .,1
the view is awesome .,1
this is my second time in paris and like the first i had to visit the eiffel tower .,1
worth the wait and the walk .,1
we had some wine and sandwiches on the lawn in the shadow of the tower .,1
do n't forget your camera as you 'll get some great shots of paris .,1
the guide was great and made the day more interesting .,1
be prepared to be hassled by street sellers constantly around the area !,1
what a fantastic experience !,1
"visited paris for four days in july , 2015 .",1
i 've seen it on tv and in movies but nothing prepared me for the sheer size of the tower and the overall scale of the engineering .,1
visible from many areas in paris .,1
"my partner , my 9 year old daughter and i visited and enjoyed every minute .",1
my experience visiting thi places was like been in a movie .,1
seated at the park from afternoon until evening ... you will get to see eiffel tower lighted up and it is so picturesque ...,1
this is obviously a must-see attraction in paris and you wo n't be disappointed with your visit .,1
it is advisable to book in advance and arrive first thing in the morning at 09h30 when they open .,1
book a tour .,1
we immediately put our bags in our room at the hotel and walked the 2 blocks to the tower .,1
very crowded to go up to the different levels .,1
"the view from the top is fantastic , but be prepared to dress warm .",1
but we loved the atmosphere .,1
we had a bit of queuing up but it went quite well .,1
"they light it up every hour on the hour , a must see !",1
it 's a tower .,1
"it 's the eiffel tower , you ca n't go to paris and not see it !",1
"also , treat yourself and go back at night when it is lit up .",1
then you wait for security .,1
really beautiful to see it at sunset and then the lights come on and it is truly a delight .,1
a very nice attraction .,1
none of those pictures do it justice .,1
came here as the trip was for my daughters birthday/christmas gift ... .,1
"we recommend going to this popular attraction although the queues for the elevator were ridiculous , even though we had priority tickets to skip the main queue .",1
"on morning , on afternoon , on night .",1
i brought 2 tickets all the way to the top as christmas present for mine fiancée .,1
the tower was much larger than we anticipated !,1
"once easily accessible by anyone from the champs del mar , she is now surrounded by security gates and fences , and requires tickets for each level of access , from the base , to the top .",1
we were in paris for 2 days and managed to get reservations at the level 58 restaurant .,1
good photo opps .,1
"obviously you need to go to the eiffel tower it has different prices to go to the top if you want to use stairs to the mid or elevator , the full rate i think is 11 euro to use the elevator .",1
definitely take the time to enjoy every aspect .,1
recommend going all the way to the top !,1
i was there with my husband and it was very romantic .,1
not to be missed as this is the most amazing and beautiful place in paris .,1
"it was worth the production we endured since we failed by not securing tickets in advance , which i do highly recommend .",1
"this was probably the fastest moving line , perhaps because it was the excitement of knowing we 'd be at the top soon !",1
went up last september .,1
"it is a beautiful sight , and the view of paris that it affords when you go up the tower , make indescribable memories for a lifetime .",1
we did not confront the crowds we had heard about so september is clearly a good time to visit .,1
i bought tickets online for a reserved time .,1
"furthermore , the staff were very friendly .",1
"you can take a picnic and sit at the champ de mars -lrb- grass area/park -rrb- , but be aware that a lot of people will be trying to sell you trinkets and cheap wine which sadly can sully the experience a little .",1
there were people of all ages and fitness levels doing it .,1
the view was magnificent !,1
"however , my children really wanted to , so we decided to go for it .",1
tight security .,1
just a warning .,1
i had been there before but i brought my wife to see it .,1
"we booked a tour of the eiffel tower by viator , and it was pretty awesome .",1
must see and climb either by stairs or elevators .,1
its difficult to define the experience of seeing the eiffel tower first time in your life .,1
you must view this at night .,1
worth booking for lunch at the 58 .,1
if you are under 26 and hold a schengen resident permit then you can visit for free .,1
when in paris the eiffel tower is the must do experience .,1
i 've had a love affair with paris since my 9th grade french class and standing under the eiffel tower was a dream come true .,1
"are there more beautiful sights in all of france , yes , but none more iconic .",1
"you can go up either walking or lift , cues were very long and i was a bit scared but i bet the views are spectacular .",1
i visit from time to time because i enjoy dining there .,1
i did n't went up bc for me the tower was the one i wanted to see : -rrb-,1
"just remember , things that go up , must come down ...",1
"the weather is starting to turn , but it is not all the way there yet .",1
if you are comming from gate du nord take bus 42 and back the same .,1
but this time i spent it by night .,1
"the history that surrounds this tower is so interesting , take a tour guide fast track entry , will show you the different sights you can see",1
"when you purchase in advance , you select a day and time for your visit , so be certain that you can actually be there on your appointed day and time .",1
"obviously a must-see in paris , both in the day time and at night .",1
then we went town to the restaurant and the food was extremely good .,1
make sure to take a look at the tower from the trocadero which is located on the other side of the seine river .,1
you can purchase the ticket & go to the top .,1
"there are so many locals & tourists , so watch your own belongings .",1
all previous times in paris i avoided going up because of the long lanes .,1
"a few signs said no alcohol , but that does n't stop the french , nor the tourists !",1
i took ticket before go to visit eiffel tower because there is very crowded for buy ticket at visiting time.i went up tower at night and when stay top of tower i can say only wwwoooowwww it is a new experience in my life because i saw the best view of paris especially sacre coeur which it was dangle frome sky .,1
gustave eiffel 's tower in paris is the # 1 attraction and is especially spectacular at daytime as it is at night .,1
this is a superb place to visit .,1
at night at the top of every hour they have it sparkle for a full 5 minutes .,1
"if possible , buy your tickets in advance to avoid lines and hassle .",1
incredible views ... it was a great way to begin our visit to paris .,1
we went to the summit for amazing views - highly recommended .,1
our trip up the eiffel tower was excellent and would recommend it as a ` must do ' activity for any visitor to paris .,1
"however , the view from the second floor was beautiful .",1
we took the elevator to the top and the views were amazing .,1
i met two of my best friends and we decided to have wine and cheese picnic on the grass area next to the tower .,1
"its way too crowded -lrb- and we were there in the cold rain of march -rrb- , views are ok and not much for the money .",1
"this made it a bit hard to protect your belongings from pickpockets as they advertise , hold the audio to your ear and take photos !",1
we went on a monday in march when the weather was a bit chilly and cloudy and it was still very crowded but you can not go to paris and not go to the eiffel tower .,1
i used the l' open tour which was good because they had 4 lines but did not have sufficient space between their buses to make the day more user friendly .,1
we left it far too late to get tickets on line .,1
from the second level we were able to have a good look around before taking the lift to the top .,1
great trip although slightly pricey .,1
it is beautiful day and night .,1
but you need to consider a lot of time before you enter the eiffel .,1
not too long at this time of year -lrb- feb -rrb- but can be 3 hours in summer .,1
"if you can , get yourself out there in the evening ... with a good camera to take night shots .",1
such wonderful history behind this monument .,1
-lrb- so cheesy ehm ehm -rrb- .,1
"it was rather cold that day , still queue was enormously long .",1
on the hour there was a light show .,1
we took the elevator up and there was a queue to get down .,1
i have done the tower many times and love it every time .,1
the bonus surprise for winter .,1
"everything is a site to behold , well except for the eiffel tower .",1
it is a beautiful piece of art - daytime and night time .,1
wow i did not expect it to be as large as it was for some reason .,1
"to say more about eiffel tower is just like telling people about the sun -- it 's evident , it 's prominent and it 's apparent .",1
big tip - purchase your tickets in advance and get as early of an entrance time as possible .,1
"it is so awesome and magnificent , just like one sees in pictures .",1
may be i expected too much before coming to paris .,1
a must do in paris.buy your tickets online around 12 $ .,1
there are some entraces you can climb by foot if you are in a good shape it might be nice but if you do n't like this you can climb in the elevator look for your favorit way in the signs in every leg of the eiffel .,1
"we 've been before , and it 's closed -lrb- as is everything -rrb- during the emergency .",1
"skip the lines and figure out the best time to go , lunch 35 euros , great view , excellent wine , clean and staff were efficient .",1
"... except for charging a fee for those who want to walk up the stairs -- we should be rewarded for one , getting good exercise , and two , not adding to the elevator line lol .",1
they have went so far as collecting donation for sick children and ran away at the first sight if police again a must see,1
i went to the 2nd floor which was high enough .,1
"visible from many perspectives and showing different shades at different times of day , this landmark is associated with a relaxing park space and a great community feeling .",1
get there early to minimise the que time .,1
you can see the tower from anywhere in paris .,1
of course visiting the iconic eiffel tower was on the top of my list of places to visit abd i have to say i am extremely content with the visit .,1
stunning by day and by night .,1
then the worst part was coming down there were only 2 elevators working with hundreds of people wanting to come down .,1
take pictures from the distant with it in the background .,1
you have to select a time slot when buying tickets and must be there 15-20 minutes before your time .,1
"view from the top as the sun set was magnificent , and we could see all the parts of paris we had visited on our trip .",1
eiffel tower is a must visit in paris .,1
it is an amazing tower and breathtaking from any angle .,1
what else can one say about this icon ?,1
it is well worth the money .,1
it stops at three different levels of the tower and you are able to get out and see the amazing view .,1
it is huge and so fascinating .,1
to each their own .,1
the elevators take you to any or all of the three levels .,1
"booked through viatour , guide was an american college student .",1
what a wonderful structure .,1
we actually do n't want other sight seeing .,1
go back to the area at night to see the tower sparkle !,1
this is one place that everyone will go to when they visit paris .,1
absolutely if one happens to be around one or two hours should be spent for taking a tour on this tower .,1
we visited the eiffel tower on a whistle stop tour of paris to see the tour de france .,1
"we sat at the bottom in a lovely park and had a picnic , when the sun goes down the tower lights up which is beautiful in itself .",1
you line up .,1
it 's expensive to go up but you should n't miss out on this landmark when you 're in paris .,1
we really did n't get stuck in any lines at all .,1
to go to the third floor top area you need a different ticket .,1
we loved going to levels two and three -lrb- the top -rrb- .,1
but -lrb- in the summer at least -rrb- you have to plan well if you want to avoid the queues :,1
you must visit `` the iron lady ! '',1
it is amazing and beautiful !!!!,1
it was nice to see in person since it 's so iconic but i was n't very amazed by it .,1
it is beautiful at night ... especially when it sparkles .,1
even in may i could n't get the ticket to the highest part of the tower .,1
the sparkle show is one of a kind and beautiful .,1
"not worth it , but so disappointing .",1
"amazing views of paris from the top , amazing to be up there when the lights start twinkling on the hour at night .",1
take time to get the lift to the top .,1
"if you 're coming to paris , you must see the eiffel tower .",1
one should really see it at night .,1
i suggest trying to go there at twilight to see the twinkling !,1
what to say about effiel tower it is a beauty if the structure i always love to see it .,1
"if you go on a perfect sunny day , the view of the eiffel tower looks picture perfect .",1
"we visited during the day and when we got nearby i was very disappointed , not impressed during the day but at night when the lights are on it 's really amazing !",1
you ca n't go to paris and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
it 's really breathtaking !!,1
the website does not you can always buy a ticket .,1
"we wanted to go up the tower , but that seemed like a waste of time .",1
"the iconic attraction of paris leaves you in awe , even in the biting cold of december .",1
everyone knows the eiffel tower is beautiful .,1
well this was again a part of our europe tour and eiffel tower is place you must not miss .,1
so just bare all this in mind apart from that lovely,1
"definitely go to the top and enjoy seeing all of paris from the height , and learning all about the history of mr. eiffel and the tower from an expert guide .",1
there are various places around eiffel tower from where you can capture its beauty .,1
"might be a bit of a line to head to the top , so whether you want to do that is up to you .",1
the tower twinkles on the hour for five minutes during the hours of darkness .,1
what was i thinking !,1
however this is somewhere you need to visit in person .,1
"very enjoyable , great views on a nice day .",1
"this is a marvel ... we did not go all the way to the top and perhaps that was an error but we all felt we had spent a wonderful amount of time admiring the view , going in the shop and enjoying being part of this iconic moment .",1
great feelings through out the climbing to top .,1
"it was amazing , but fairly pricey .",1
not bad at all !,1
so for all those that might think no advance tickets make it a lost cause - it might not be so bad after all .,1
"it was very crouded underneath , all the barriers , security cabins and solders with rifles around made an impression that it 's a military base or a refugees camp , not a tourist attraction .",1
we did n't have pre-booked tickets and could n't buy any online .,1
"6 choices , each , for entree , mains and dessert !",1
so romantic and so beautiful !,1
"what a spectacular structure , with an awesome presence , in one of the world most beautiful cities .",1
"the wait to get onto the lift is quite enclosed and squished the british term would be called `` packed like sardines '' , the only bad thing about the eiffel tower is waiting and the tight squeeze , other than that everything else is amazing the view is awesome and just so romantic .",1
be sure to go into the short movie next to the restaurant as it is a lovely snapshot of the tower .,1
stay late after sunset to see a lit up tower .,1
"we arrived at 4 pm , and were out again at 8pm , i checked .",1
two young people -lrb- about 17 -rrb- ran up to my 18 year old daughter with a clipboard in the girl 's hand asking her to sign for a charity .,1
magical and love the sparkly lights !,1
just awesome !!!!,1
the view from the top was stunning !,1
most of them is 3 person and try to explain you about charity and donation .,1
"if you want it to be a true crowd pleaser , and still have time to do other major attractions in the same day , you need to make smart choices .",1
but the unorganised line up on the second floor is ridiculous .,1
security is tight but worth the wait .,1
we visited several times in our trip and the kids loved going up to the top .,1
it has 3 levels .,1
the sourrounding area is so beautiful that its not a surprise why paris is called the city of love .,1
like a dream .,1
"my favorite part of a visit to the eiffel tower is purchasing champagne on the summit , it 's a great way to toast your visit to the great country of france .",1
"it 's very safe , but can be slippery if it 's wet .",1
the eiffel tower remains one of the '' `` must sees '' of paris .,1
it was raining and cold but still did not dampen our spirits and experience visiting the eiffel tower .,1
no worries regarding waiting time in the que .,1
"there was a light show , the entire tower lit up with sparkling strobe lights at 10pm and 11pm for 5 minutes each time .",1
i purchased the tickets for the lift entrance with access to the 2nd floor for 17 euros a piece for adults .,1
on going down the elevator get off the 1st level where the restaurant is .,1
"we showed up about 1.5 hours before it opened and were at the first of line ... we had that long wait but soon as the gate opened , we were promptly whisked up to the summit .",1
well it turned out it was right time since you get chance to see sunset and beautiful light show on eiffel tower at night -lrb- 10:00 pm -rrb- as well .,1
its nice to walk around trocadero to eiffel tower and back .,1
we had booked in advance and despite the rain -lrb- you would think this would keep people away -rrb- it was quite crowded .,1
a day to remember .,1
go late and if you 're lucky you will see the hundreds of roller skaters -lrb- with a police escort -rrb- circling the tower on the street .,1
the night visit and climb to the second level were awesome !!,1
but to catch the eiffel tower lighted up we went up close the next day again and caught it finally lighted up about 830 or was it 930 pm when dusk fell .,1
we were lucky enough to pre-book a visit and were escorted through the entrance very quickly bypassing the lines .,1
i never tire of seeing the eiffel tower !,1
standing under the tower i could really appreciate the size and was amazed at this historical accomplishment .,1
i did n't expect to be amazed but i was .,1
there is a little cafe as well as the 58 eiffel restaurant -lrb- we popped into the cafe for a warming coffee & hot chocolate which was ok -rrb- .,1
all in all : doable en enjoyable for someone who is afraid of heights !,1
getting on top of the eiffel tower is a must in paris !!,1
at one stage i waited 30 mins for a bus and then 4 came one after the other .,1
we rushed up to the summit and then on the way back down took in the other levels .,1
"absolutely stunning structure , the enormity of which becomes apparent only when one is close to or very close to it .",1
visit at night -- it 's beautiful just to stand at the bottom .,1
hourly light show and fantastic photo shots .,1
a very good experience and a must visit .,1
it was raining despite that it was crowded .,1
oh how the years have changed .,1
there is food stands located on the property too .,1
you know you are in paris when you see the eiffel tower .,1
"either day or night , the sight was beautiful .",1
"get yourself an selfiestick , it helps you a lot when taking pictures for your album at home",1
the little ice rink on the first level was fun for kids .,1
i visited the eiffel tower on a rainy day and it was still a great visit .,1
the elevator does n't initially stop at the first floor and so if you want to do that you need to take the stairs .,1
one of the places that is a must see .,1
i will remember this moment for the rest of my life .,1
the tower is amazing i could spend days there just enjoying it would love to see it again sometime soon,1
great engineering and beautiful seine river scene .,1
"there are lots of places to picnic , tours available , on land and on the river seine , amusement area for children .",1
it was quite chilly but to be expected !,1
"this is n't a tall structure , but worth doing the visit .",1
that way you can see both day light views & night time lights around the paris city .,1
"if you book the restaurant , in advance , you do n't have to wait in the lineup to get up to the top .",1
"yes , it can be a little annoying because of the long lines and the time you waist waiting there ... but when you are up there ... there are no words to describe !",1
yes it 's worth it to go to the very top .,1
"it is a beautiful view from the top and we had really nice weather , but there is lines are too long to get up , -lrb- about 4 hours in line -rrb-",1
great for honeymooners .,1
"only downfall is you get pretty thirsty going up all those stairs , but you are n't aloud to take your own beverage or food up with you and a bottle of water costs $ 3 up there !",1
the area around the tower is bristling with activity .,1
you can also visit the gift shops and grab a tasty snack right in the tower .,1
walked up the stairs to the 2nd level and took the elevator to the top .,1
we stayed just a few blocks from the tower and witnessed amazing views from our seventh story apartment .,1
"❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ ❄ if you coming from the usa , especially the northeast , the winters in paris are just as cold as being in the northeast !!!",1
"it 's structure is sound , beautiful and stunning from below and on top .",1
spend good amount of time not only taking photos but also enjoy the view .,1
to get to the ticket booth was harder .,1
been up the tower twice absolutely amazing views all around paris .,1
"beautiful at night when it 's lit up , but you need to time it right because it only lights up once an hour .",1
a magnificent structure !,1
i will admit that it 's not easy climbing about 600 stairs but it is sooo worth it !!!!,1
"the views from the top are amazing , an icon not to be missed !",1
hope to go another time when it 's less crowded .,1
get a personalized tour with summit access .,1
"if you can come back at night , the lights they have installed are fabulous and at 11pm i think or at certain time maybe 10pm , they blink and look really neat .",1
it 's awesome feeling and knowing the history behind this is also kinda nice .,1
"very cool to go see , the lines to go up the tower was huge and we decided to not wait .",1
the lines are long and the wait is longer .,1
"you see much more of how they build the structure , it 's cheaper and you line up quicker , because the most want to use the elevators .",1
"and moreover if u take up the stairs to reach the top , , the view is beyond imagination ... so so beautiful .",1
the view from the observationdeck is breathtaking .,1
also if ur age is 24 or below u get the youth ticket which is slightly cheaper .,1
still a great place to visit even in august when the crowds are massive .,1
"if you 're into pictures , you can get some nice pictures of paris from the top of the eiffel tower , but you can also get nice pictures of paris from other areas as well .",1
long wait but worth it .,1
there were only about 5 other families in front of us .,1
when i started to make reservations for the eiffel tower it was booked .,1
grab a bottle of wine and have a picnic in the park adjacent to the tower instead .,1
well worth a visit to one of the worlds most famous landmarks !,1
the eiffel tower is the most iconic view and monument in paris .,1
we didnt .,1
beautiful piece of engineering from all angles .,1
essentially this was to provide entertainment for our daughter and avoid queueing .,1
"we went to the summit and had a wonderful experience , the children absolutely loved it and a definite must visit .",1
take your time and walk around to the champs du mars .,1
we were lucky - there was no queue so we could go quickly through the security controls and then we could enjoy the most beautiful view of the city .,1
i would catch myself looking at the time every time i drove past it in the evening in hopes of catching a glimpse of the light show again .,1
we queued for only a short time for the eiffel tower tour but we only made it to the first level .,1
lots of vendors are eating outlets ... esp with help of hop in hop off buses ... lots o gb cameramen ... buts of cheaters too ...,1
i 'll talk about my whole experience which can be useful for others .,1
we got there early and there were hardly any people on there with us so we did n't feel crowded or rushed .,1
"be sure to kiss under the tower , as paris is after-all the city of love !",1
5 euroes for a bottle of pop very expensive .,1
came in 3/2017 and only realized need to book ticket way in advance .,1
obviously a good idea but will delay your visit and eat into your day .,1
we went up to the 2nd stage and walked down to the first where the glass floor is .,1
"when in paris the eiffel tower visit is a staple , nonetheless we opted for staying in the ground and enjoy views of the city from other destinations -lrb- such as montmartre -rrb- .",1
it was especially beautiful at night after dinner .,1
fun to see this iconic landmark up close .,1
there is no need to repeat how great this icon is .,1
then you can walk down the stairs and cross the road to get to the tower .,1
in fact we purchased several of the key chains just for fun .,1
as famous i do n't have much to say just you must to go .,1
and to think that all of this was built for the great universal exhibition !!!,1
a very romantic place indeed .,1
line to come down was as long to go up,1
"booked through the paris convention site , this dinner and fast track access to the eiffel tower made for a lovely evening .",1
and it looks stunning !!!,1
that being said .,1
"consider eating at the food walk-ups around the tower , it is actually pretty good - get a crepe !!!",1
we really enjoyed the views and was very well set out .,1
the views at the top are magnificent and as it was a beautiful we could see all arounder the city .,1
the tower looks really majestic and awesome .,1
"still a long wait for the elevators , but it is the eiffel tower right ?",1
"stay away from buying overpriced souvenirs - they are not unique , and can be found anywhere in paris .",1
the restaurant at the top of the tower has a breath taking view of paris .,1
visited on a saturday and queued for an hour to go up the tower to the summit .,1
well worth the ticked and the very very long queues !!,1
no bottles/liquids to the lift .,1
stunning both during the day and at night .,1
do n't miss this opportunity .,1
now we 're left wondering how do we get a refund of our aud$ 280 when the companies involved are unresponsive ?,1
taking photos however is a challenging task .,1
i was sooooo glad i did .,1
by the time the deck opened the line was very very long .,1
go to the park behind it and have a picnic looking at the eiffel tower on a sunny day .,1
"the view is incredible , we spend an hour up there just looking across the city and taking pictures !",1
also you get queue jump then .,1
such a symbolic part of paris !,1
it 's pretty easy to climb the eiffeltower .,1
it definitely gets crowded so make sure your group stays together and you hold hands with young children .,1
"extremely romantic at night all lit up , the eiffel tower is a definate for anyone , especially if it is a first time trip .",1
"best to book skip the line tickets online , or book with a tour company like viator .",1
"we all enjoyed the while experience , which was enhanced by the crowds in the park below , cheering in the french eurocup team .",1
excellent value for money .,1
"once we walked down to the ground floor it was 9pm so we went out to the grassed area , had an ice cream and waited until 10pm for the tower to light up .",1
"on the news , they were predicting temperatures in some parts of 39 degrees .",1
the wine made everything alright .,1
"the husband and me fell instantly in love the moment we set eyes on the eiffel , the aura around is just so amazing i cant even begin to describe it took me awhile to absorb it all .",1
"hopefully it 's clear on the day you go , so you get the great views .",1
it is very fun to be inside the tower as you walk down .,1
i found it to be pretty interesting to see the tower up close and personal .,1
views from the second level are amazing and worth the extra climb .,1
the third floor is high enough for nice panoramic views without kicking into gear anyone 's acrophobia .,1
security personnel agreed with me that this was not smart .,1
it is quite beautiful at night .,1
we came down in 2 hours and then spent some time sitting on the grass next to the tower where there are a lot of vendors selling wine/champagne .,1
if you climb the stairs to the next level there is a small area for free that you can take photos without paying to go to the top floor .,1
after we complained to non english speaking staff we were allowed to jump the line and use the stairs -lrb- the line for this was almost as long -rrb- .,1
worth pre-booking .,1
they 're not always nice when you say no .,1
buy the ticket option that allows you to go all the way to the top .,1
"without reservations ahead of time -lrb- can be made online -rrb- , you will be waiting in very long lines ... and we were there on a weekday in april .",1
the actual eiffel tower is what is expected .,1
the tower is amazing and looks beautiful when it gets light up in night .,1
"just be warned that you may have to queue for a while , but it is worth it .",1
"i 've been during the day and night-time and both are spectacular so if you 're worried about missing something , go before sunset so you get the best of both views !",1
i thought i 'd find the experience ` cheesy ' bun in truth it was wonderful .,1
"wet shoes and cold , i walked around and enjoyed ever minute .",1
we were n't able to catch it but was able to see it lit up with 3 different colors - the belgium flag colors after the attacks in brussels .,1
never fails to live up to its expectations my two kids had only seen this on tv and we 're in awe of its size and beauty .,1
"my recommendation for all of does that will like an unforgettable romantic paris experience , with and authentic paris feel as seen in the movies , go to versailles and stay there you will not regretted .",1
the times for `` exceptional '' passed a century ago .,1
beware of the fellas selling trinkets as they can be very aggressive .,1
for 10 minutes on every hour -lrb- after sunset until 1 am ... 2 am i believe is the cut off during the summer months -rrb- the eiffel will light up .,1
it 's one of those must see things .,1
then walked up close and waited for another light show -lrb- every hour for only 5 minutes -rrb- .,1
and move away !,1
if you have to do it take the metro to trocadero,1
"on the grass during the day young people are having fun and enjoy the beautiful weather , in the evening they listen to music , drinking a drink , enjoy with friends .",1
family were happy to walk which i think added to the experience .,1
so much fun going to the top and viewing the city !,1
"we went here the end of august and the queues to get up the eiffel tower were ridiculous , with waiting times up to a couple of hours in searing heat -lrb- no shade -rrb- so we chose not to do that .",1
"the only problem is we were constantly bothered with people offering water , alcohol etc. .",1
walked through the park around it and went under it .,1
"not on , y was the apartment literally 2 blocks from the tower , along with a view of the tower but we also paid $ 750 for 5 days !!!",1
we hung out there for a few hours in the grass field around the tower .,1
it is obviously so hyped but it still lives up to some of the fascination .,1
"would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting paris , it 's a must !",1
i 've seen all the sci - fi movies and they usually destroy the main symbol of the great cities .,1
you go all the way to the top to start with .,1
finally having the opportunity to see this icon in person was pretty cool and breathtaking .,1
"there are lift entries on all corners - most people tend to just start queuing on whichever line is the longest -lrb- assuming that 's the main one -rrb- , so choose smartly .",1
very busy and very crowded but staff very good at moving things along .,1
it was freezing -lrb- dec 2015 -rrb- but seeing the lights dance around the tower at night made it totally worth it !,1
if you 're willing to summit eiffel tower you can pick up tickets from second level of eiffel tower for 6 $ .,1
"nice to take pictures , was very quiet when we where there .",1
bought tickets for dinner on the tower well before we came .,1
no matter how many times i 've visited the eiffel tower i always love it .,1
the view is spectacular but it ` seems not really wort standing in question for hours just to go up if it ' a not your first visit .,1
the eiffel tower is something you just have to see once in your life .,1
go at night for smaller lines and an amazing view of lights as far as your eyes can see .,1
the line did n't take too long .,1
we were pre-booked and so no queues .,1
i think everything about eiffel tower has been already said .,1
"you really do not need a tour guide , just read about it before you go .",1
"it is free to look at , but you can ascend into the tower levels and it is worth the time",1
but the night show was a sight to be seen .,1
auch für kinder .,1
this experience could be so much more enjoyable and streamlined if they put some simple line/cue engineering in place .,1
"trip up the tower is once in a lifetime event , do it once if you can .",1
this was a wow experience !,1
"excellent activity to do , whether you 've got 4 year olds or you 're 70 years old .",1
to crowded for our liking .,1
in warmer weather however - do it .,1
"best views of paris are from the top of the tower , where also many romantic proposals of marriage have been successful .",1
"as with most places with lots of tourists bumping into one another , watch your pockets .",1
souvenir shops sell over priced things that are breakable .,1
"unfortunately our plans to go up to the top got foiled by an unexpected thunderstorm , but it was still worth it to get up close to this iconic structure and realize just how grand it is .",1
despite arriving at the opening time of 9-30am it was a 90 minute wait to buy a ticket and get into the lift that takes you directly to the 2nd floor .,1
they closed the summit due to wind .,1
"cliche , i know , but you ca n't go to paris without visiting paris 's most noticeable landmark .",1
we visited during christmas period .,1
"also , the restaurant inside the second level is beautiful and romantic for a nice dinner !",1
the architecture and the sheer size and beauty is indescribable .,1
"i was wearing a tracker and by the time i reached the second tier , it only added 42 flights of stairs to my day .",1
i took a group and a girl had money stolen .,1
missed firworks on previous day .,1
experience the tower both at night and in the morning .,1
great views across paris still though - just be prepared to wait !!,1
much more enjoyable .,1
was n't too stunned then and the experience was no different this time round either .,1
"once it was full-dark , we walked back down from the second floor which was very enjoyable .",1
we diced to go with the stairs .,1
we did not have to wait too long for the summit even though we did not have skip the line access .,1
the eiffel tower is a dazzler ... especially at night .,1
i have acrophobia -lrb- a fear of heights -rrb- so i found it a little scary but like when you are on a roller coaster sometimes being scared can make it more fun .,1
you used to be able to walk through but now there are huge ugly fences up around the outside .,1
you can not visit paris without going to the eiffel tower .,1
food was exceptional .,1
awesome views .,1
i purchased a skip the line pass with a guide .,1
it was a really good and fun experience !,1
the view from eiffel is definitely breathtaking .,1
"we noticed many days , the top of the tower was obscured by low clouds .",1
they ask you if you speak english .,1
a must visit attraction when in paris .,1
"but if you want to go up in the tower , it should only be just to tell people you 've done it .",1
there is a lot more security than my last visit .,1
i could look at the eiffel tower .,1
we took plenty of photos and crossed the seine to the musee homme .,1
i would go back in a heartbeat beautiful city .,1
you should get reservations so your visit will not be tainted we had a very little wait .,1
"felt really as i was on top of the world , the view from the top was breathtaking .",1
"before our recent trip , i read more about the construction of the tower and its builder .",1
i went there during the evening .,1
when using the lifts there are commonly more than one entrance so walk around and find the shortest line :-rrb- there is a fun post office box at the base you can mail post cards from and they will be post marked `` mailed from the eiffel tower '' .,1
"the views were spectacular but be sure to dress warmly , the wind was biting cold so it did n't allow for a long stay .",1
"was relatively quiet too despite going at midday , definitely worth the money and the view from the summit was incredible .",1
we all enjoyed a glass of champagne from the champagne bar / window at the top .,1
"amazing views to take in and at night went it is all lit up , it was beautiful .",1
we decided to walk up the stairs .,1
we bought our tickets online but the day we went there was no lineup .,1
"first impression , not that big but when you ride the elevator to the top you realise just how big it really is .",1
took the metro to all the top sites and never a problem .,1
there were cops everywhere and allow it to happen .,1
"-lrb- also it is cheaper :-rrb- -rrb- enjoy the view , the architecture and being a part of paris .",1
we went to the top around dusk so we could see the city in the day and night time .,1
it is pretty incredible to see in person and well worth a visit .,1
it 's something to knock off your bucket list but nothing extremely special .,1
you really need to do a tour to understand the amount of engineering and work that went into this outstanding structure .,1
on closer observation .,1
if you are booking with a tour company specifically ask them if you will be going inside .,1
so if you go in knowing that then you 'll be fine .,1
"you 'll get much better views from the arc de triomphe or sacre coeur if you feel like paying for it , or from the terrace in front of sacre coeur if you want a view for free .",1
it is probably the best night point of view of paris !,1
and so worth it !!!,1
"but be aware that it is not what you see in postcards , movies , etc. .",1
we fell in love with this tower !,1
the little coffee shops are also good just a little over priced .,1
we did a behind-the-scenes tour -lrb- reviewed separately -rrb- .,1
you have to keep tipping up your head to see the top .,1
cool experience of rising over the skyline of paris .,1
we 're given an awesome seat right along the window .,1
i recommend approaching from the bayeaux side as there as so many illegal souvenier sellers in chambes mar. .,1
but as it 's one of the main attractions it is very busy .,1
there is lots to read about and see apart from just the sites and was fairly quiet when we were there .,1
"no matter how many times i see her , she thrills with her iconic beauty ... this trip she sported a soccer ball hanging in her center in honor of the european cup games taking place in the stadium of france .",1
the tower and its surroundings served as a fan zone for the excited soccer fans from across europe ... they were draped in the flags of their countries on each game day and celebrated nightly with fervor ... the tower always offers a surprise or two ...,1
we were on our own after that and purchased a 6 euro ticket for access to the top .,1
open until late in the evening - a must do .,1
"since it was not so crowded , there was ample opportunity for good pictures .",1
unfortunately for us loads of barracades due to european soccer fans/crowds everywhere so not so easy to access tonight .,1
arrived around 19h20 and this turned out a brilliant time to visit .,1
"did n't climb up though but just by being there , you get that awesome exceptional feeling !",1
after coming down go little far so tha you can take your pic with the tower .,1
"we eventually hunted down another member of non english speaking staff who opened the stairs for us - it was shambolic , we wasted so much time here that we missed another attraction .",1
if possible make sure you book tickets in advance to avoid queuing from 1 to 2 hours to go up the eiffel tower !,1
"very nice visit , you have to pick a nice day for the view i choose viator in order to avoid the queue and for the service an guided tour",1
it nearly brought me to tears .,1
by night illumination breath taking and stunning - find it hard to move away from it .,1
on the first floor -lrb- premier etage -rrb- they have areas that have translucent flooring that you can stand on and look at the people and street below .,1
to go to level two there is also a option to climb by stairs which you can do if you have the time and stamina .,1
"the area is currently patrolled by armed soldiers , because the french have had enough of terrorists , which gives the area an added feeling of security .",1
well worth it to go up to the viewing areas and then take pictures from below and in front of it from the grass .,1
you have to have a lot of patience to wait to go up .,1
"we stopped our car , and i accosted a gentleman on the street .",1
the trocadero metro station is a good one to use for a good view of the tower especially at night : -rrb-,1
have visited eiffel twice and have finally got round to writing a few words on the attraction .,1
best thing to do is buy the tickets online and then just walk through .,1
"for me , paris was always more than the famous eiffel tower .",1
would never have known without going up high .,1
"in the night when it is illuminated , it becomes majestic .",1
enjoy la dame de fer !,1
"avoid them , they are very expensive .",1
lovely time afterwards getting some lunch and having a picnic on the glass below the tower .,1
but as a world famous tourist attraction i am sure it could be better organised .,1
"we can see the tower from our apartment , and we have been under it already , but we got up to the top today : -rrb-",1
its so impressive and also beautiful .,1
"we took our 13 year old granddaughter to europe for spring break , her number one item to see was the eiffel tower .",1
some other reviews seemed to indicate more formal dress so we went out and bought a tie .,1
the queue was about 40 minutes to get our ticket and lift to the second floor .,1
but otherwise it is the best place to be day or night .,1
"during our trip we wanted to eat at one of the restaurants in the eiffel tower , i am glad that we did .",1
it is a marvel and its ubiquitous .,1
"be aware that up here the wind is strong and cold so dress appropriately , you will love it .",1
it is such an amazing view !,1
it is highly recommended that you buy tickets ahead of time so there is no wait .,1
wrap up warm as it is open and windy in the evening .,1
security is very high but that just makes you feel so much safer .,1
this is real good considering that you can feel very safe all over the city of lights .,1
no trip to paris would be complete without a stop at the eiffel tower .,1
best time is mid-morning .,1
highlight of trip to paris .,1
"my daughter and mum went on a day trip to paris for her birthday booked before the terrible shooting in paris it was not a very good atmosphere i am afraid , but a side that we booked a beat the line for the effie tower through a company called getyourguide which was really no need on this day which was the 24/12/2015 as it was total empty anyway this company gave us instructions to pick up tickets at 14:30 in the park yes the park they never turned up of course and after emailing them several times they will not refund the money so my advice is do not book with getyourguide cheats in my eyes , but we will be back even if this day was not very nice",1
absolutely stunning views .,1
"we loved every experience in paris , and this tour is at the top of our long list .",1
a trip to paris is not complete without a visit to the eiffel tower .,1
you will see the tower as soon as you got up the stairs from the metro .,1
although it was a very long que but the view was quite amazing .,1
we went to eiffel tower at night .,1
if you do n't visit the eiffel tower then you have n't visited paris !,1
"if you can get organized before you leave on your trip , you can get tickets online from home : tour-eiffel .",1
it was great despite the weather .,1
"you have a choice of climbing to the first level , or taking the lift .",1
the beauty of the design and the impact of the edifice gave yet another reason for us to consider our first trip to paris a revelation and a joy .,1
"i went up the tour eiffel with my husband , who has a major fear of heights .",1
it was cold and windy during the wait .,1
"as an architect , this is simply a stunning achievement in structural engineering , design , and construction .",1
"i got there around 11am or around that , there was crowds but they moved fast .",1
too bad that the gypsies are making it difficult to go there and just enjoy the view .,1
so great tour,1
loved this !,1
"the area around is very touristy , your time would be better spent elsewhere in paris .",1
for us it was the third time .,1
it 's the iconic eiffel tower .,1
"it 's worth the wait , but make reservations online -lrb- we did n't -rrb- .",1
the view is superb .,1
enjoy the crowd .,1
we arrived half an hour after opening -lrb- july 30 -rrb- and were on the top level within an hour -lrb- note : we also chose to summit right away instead of observing the second level immediately -rrb- .,1
this was definitely worth the money .,1
was sold out months in advance .,1
"having walked near to the actual tower itself , have to say i prefer the view from the trocadero especially on a good day .",1
i have been there with my girl friend for 3 day .,1
"once through security , you get into the line to buy your ticket .",1
very popular to tourists .,1
we have visited the tower before during the summer months but the spring was even more beautiful .,1
"it can take a long time , so on a hot day , do take plenty of drinks as you wo n't be able to purchasing anything during security / queue / journey up - we saw a few fractious families who had run out of water .",1
the tower sparkles every hour for 5 mins after the sunset .,1
very busy .,1
the eiffel tower is spectacular .,1
its all lit up and looks just stunning .,1
mans engineering at its finest .,1
we 've been to paris before and did n't go up the eiffel tower because we did n't want to waste our precious time in a queue .,1
it is something one must do atleast once in their lives .,1
best to be viewed from a distance .,1
the queues are very long for this and its not for the faint hearted as it can be quite windy as you go up .,1
"however , you must also visit at night on the hour when it is twinkling with lights - magical !",1
enough said .,1
"my daughters first visit to paris and she was n't disappointed with her trip up the tower , neither were we after our 3rd visit !",1
the eiffel tower is a must see when you visit paris .,1
"as most things in paris , it was bigger than i imagined it .",1
freezing cold up there during winter .,1
afterwards you have to take a short walk to reach and feel a tiny thing between it and you .,1
"there is still a line , but it is so much smaller !",1
just do n't be roped into spending a fortune in the souvenir shop inside when there are so many men walking around outside selling eiffel tower key rings for one euro and flashing light up eiffel towers for around $ 5-7 .,1
paris = eiffel tower !,1
"if you have n't been , make sure you go !",1
at night do catch the twinkle of the tower every hour .,1
stay in a hotel facing the tower to experience it best -lrb- little heavy on pocket -rrb- .,1
awesome views of paris from above .,1
historically beautiful place .,1
"it 's for sure that eiffel tower looks amazing in pictures , but in real life you see the real beauty of it !",1
no regrets .,1
it was too touristy for us and we -lrb- my wife and kid -rrb- just walked across from it and crossed the river to more attractive places .,1
we took a city tour so we could have a guide make arrangements for our entry .,1
too many people trying to snap pictures .,1
"after our visit , we got tickets to the water-taxi that takes you to several monuments where you 're able to get on/off , and we enjoyed that as well !",1
"the eiffel tower can be seen from all over paris , so it is amazing when you finally get up close and personal .",1
lunch at the restaurant capped off the visit .,1
it is still a magnificent structure the area around the base is fenced off .,1
how can you go to paris and not go to the top ?,1
we then went back at night and loved seeing the tower lit up .,1
definitely worth going .,1
you will want to plan an hour at the minimum for visiting the eiffel tower .,1
"there is a huge queue to ascend , so we did n't bother to do so although i 'm sure the view is awesome .",1
great city views .,1
i agree with other that the night view is the best time to visit .,1
"both views of the tower were amazing , however i have to say that seeing the tower 's light show at night was magical .",1
i 've visited a lot of towers and structures around the world and this one is my least favourite .,1
"there are many pick pockets who work this area , so tourists need pay close attention to their surroundings while visiting the large crowds wading at the base area of the tower .",1
short lineup for return trip down .,1
"met our guide from fat tire tours , fast track up to the second tier , then all the information you need to know and a lot more , went to the top which was extra and a fantastic view of paris ,",1
you will need to go all the way to the top of the tower .,1
"i am a parisian , last time i took someone up the eiffel tower we had to stay in line for 2 hours !",1
it was great but it gets really crowded up there and the views are not just the best .,1
we went to the top floor .,1
"take the metro line , -lrb- one of their trains have no conductors , that was interesting",1
you can stay up as long as you want .,1
taking the stairs on the way down gives you a fantastic look at the incredible engineering which holds the tower up .,1
"we did n't get inside , just walked around and enjoyed the surrounding , awesome !",1
"obviously , a must see when going to paris .",1
"the once greatest symbol of the beautiful city of paris , the eiffel tower and surrounding champs de mars park resembles ever more a garbage fields : hordes of disrespectful tourists , dozens of busses parked in front of the tower which makes it impossible to shoot a decent picture , illegal tricycles everywhere selling silly overpriced rides , destroyed lawns after the euro fanzones 2016 , garbage floating everywhere and dozens of eastern europeans -lrb- roms and other -rrb- trying all sort of silly scams etc. .",1
we climbed instead of taking the lift .,1
queued for a while and then gave up .,1
the view of all the major monuments just blows me away,1
we did not get in to the eiffel tower because the day we had reservations for it was closed .,1
we were lucky to have been there just before the flood .,1
"low crowd , ample light and we could stay late enough to see the tower glow at 11pm .",1
no problems with lines if you make reservations in advance .,1
my first visit was in 1984 .,1
it is an icon but the tourist from world make long queue requiring lot of time.now we have many competitive land marks but old icon still rules,1
you ca n't go to paris and miss le tour eiffel .,1
choose the sunset time and do not hesitate to climb to the top first and then visit the second floor .,1
gorgeous area around eiffel tower,1
it does a short sparkling light show on the hour that makes for beautiful video .,1
"we went to the top of the eiffel tower , lots of people , but well organized .",1
it was hated at first but now it is loved .,1
"incredible place to visit , breath taking and a dream come true !",1
the best view of the eiffel tower is away from it .,1
"also we decide to go up during the day and going all the way to the top is definitely worth it , we even had a couple glasses of champagne at the top to make it that bit more special .",1
dont waste money going up in the restaurant .,1
dress warmly as it 's pretty cold and windy up at 300 meter high .,1
it 's magical when they turn the lights on .,1
my husband and i took a day trip to london and returned to paris in the evening .,1
i wish the police would not allow it .,1
especially when they turn on the lights for the eiffel tower and it sparkles .,1
the eiffel towerit is truly spectacular and symbolic .,1
"the tourist centre for a good reason , its magnificent .",1
we have been here a number of times before but the guide made a valuable difference .,1
nice view of the paris !,1
wanted champagne but 12 euros is not worth it for 1 small glass .,1
we did not book tickets in advance which is pretty expensive .,1
only after you argue with them they reveal the hidden pos and you finally get your ticket to stand in another queue to get up to the top .,1
the excitement of the family was contagious .,1
"see the city at night has a magical essence and it 's easy to identify the most iconic monuments as notre dame , the arch triumph .",1
"go up to the top of the tower , it 's worth it !",1
too bad they had to wait in line for 2 hours and were unable to go to the top seeing that it was closed !,1
"once i got down at paris station , it was full of excitement as it is a dream destination for tourists .",1
we visited the eiffel tower twice during our 5 day stay .,1
take a walk around the towel is by default the utmost romantic thing a couple can do .,1
the eiffel tower is the icon of paris and it would be a shame not to see it up close but i wouldnt bother going up .,1
on our last day we finally went up the tower .,1
elevators are paid till top .,1
i am afraid of heights !!,1
i finally actually went up to the summit and had a delight full meal on 58 eiffel .,1
i have been to paris several times and until recently never really spent much time around the eiffel tower and now i wonder why !,1
but one of the most fun things i 've done in paris ?,1
"the eiffel tower is full of romance , culture and history .",1
try book ahead but it 's almost booked up ahead 3 months in advance !,1
"also , a good atmosphere around it with people playing music and eating local food that you find in cafes or a street vendor -lrb- easier to eat at a cafe before or after though -rrb- .",1
great visit at xmas season .,1
we took the stairs which meant a very short wait but met other interesting people along the way .,1
the tower and the gardens were completely deserted .,1
"we knew it would be pricey , but we did not know that the dinner was an assembly line with unhappy servers expecting lots of tips , mcdonald 's rated and overcooked food , hurried along to finish and get out , and poor service .",1
i went to the park at eiffel tower but did not go up .,1
anyone visiting paris already knows all about the tower as my wife and i surely did .,1
we got there first thing in the morning which is what i highly recommend its always busy place !!!,1
"i personally had been to france over 30 times in my life but never to paris , i had always hoped it would be amazing and incredibly it was even better .",1
it is everything it 's cracked up to be .,1
i anticipated that it would be dark in color when in fact it is much lighter .,1
paris is a romantic city and im sure you will fall in love with .,1
make sure to get the advance tickets or go with a walking tour .,1
we all met up on the first level and from there you have to take the lifts to get to the top .,1
"an experience to definately put on your list if you are seeing paris for the first time ,",1
bonus the line is so much charter than the eiffel towers .,1
you can see it from all over the city but you should definitely see it up close too .,1
the tower is must-see and the view from the top is well worth it .,1
plan your visit in advance and book your tickets online .,1
we were here before 9:00 am and there was already a long line to go up .,1
it is very close .,1
but as we reached the counter they stopped tickets to climb to the top .,1
"this tower is just breath taking , so huge and much better in person than in the movies .",1
although one does have to queue to buy a ticket and then again to catch the lift up and then queue to catch the lift down and again if you want to break the journey and see the sights from the first level .,1
"secondly , it has become the ultimate landmark .",1
das beste ist das umgehen der warteschlange .,1
"this iconic landmark in paris france was an absolute joy to visit.the eiffel tower definitely leaves a positive impression on you in every way.at night , especially midnight when they put on the extra lights in the tower it 's even more magnificent than it 's in the day !",1
my fiance and i visited the eiffel tower when we were in paris in september 2014 .,1
visited the tower by day and then again the same evening .,1
theeifeel tower is one of those iconic places you know so well.we went on a beautiful sunny saturday.wehadprebooked tickets to the second level but unfortunately could n't book tickets to the top of the tower in advance .,1
unless you love crowds and long lines .,1
"it is the eiffel tower , one of the most famous landmarks in the entire world and any visit to paris would n't be complete without a trip to the top from which the views are fantastic .",1
we were informed that it was not unusual to have a 45 minute wait to take the next lift up to the very top from the 2nd floor .,1
"needless to say the views are spectacular and on a good day you can have panoramic views all over paris , being easy to pick out well known landmarks like notre dame cathedral and the dome of the sacre coeur .",1
my trip to paris was last minute so all of the online ticket windows for the eiffel tower were sold out for months .,1
guess i 'll have to come back !,1
"second visit to the eiffel tower , second time up , first time with my husband ... best time !",1
"what can you say , it 's the eiffel tower and you ca n't go to paris without visiting it .",1
saw much more than we could see from the top anyway .,1
"i have been to the eiffel tower many times , have walked the stairs with my kids , and drank champagne at the tip .",1
"not sure what 's the fuss about it , it is nice but the view is better from montmartre !",1
"next tme i return i have to go up and take a picture.great attraction , yet too see it lit up.i went with mother and we both loved paris",1
it was really nice to go up and see paris from above .,1
best views of paris anywhere .,1
its magical .,1
we did n't have advance booking so we went to the tower early to avoid long queues .,1
even the massive rain cloud overhead did not ruin our afternoon at the eiffel tower !,1
we enjoyed going to the grounds of the eiffel tower .,1
book your tickets online to avoid ticket lines .,1
good security at the entrance checked all bags .,1
we had champagne on the middle level !,1
amazing views of paris and a lot of photo opportunities .,1
"beer or wine if you chose , my husband ordered braised beef and i ordered trout .",1
it 's simply amazing !,1
this was a beautiful place and we are definitely coming back to do it again for our 28th anniversary in 2 years yeah .,1
walk up yo second level ticket is 7 euro and the ticket from 2nd level to summit is 6 euros .,1
this was our first trip to paris and we had booked a tour at night to go to the eiffel tower .,1
"the service was also poor , which was disappointing .",1
"at night at the top of the hour there is a light show , so keep your eyes peeled for that .",1
i was gutted .,1
i missed seeing the lights in the night .,1
"this is the second time , i see eiffel tower and every time i feel amazed with the view , and there are people offering to buy some souvenir along walking to the tower , so be very careful with your belonging",1
just 2 important hints :,1
"long security queue , then a shorter queue for the tickets -lrb- $ 7 to walk to the second level -rrb- .",1
what to say about this famous spot that has n't already been said ?,1
unfortunately too complicated to go in and up .,1
we climbed the stairs but at least when you get to the top you 'll have the satisfaction of having made it up 704 steps .,1
considering the lines we saw waiting to buy tickets i was certainly glad we did that .,1
have lunch and enjoy the views .,1
it was stunning .,1
"thus , the fact that there was fog was a relief for me and i enjoyed the view , which was the same impressive , from the ground , .",1
i am sooooo happy to be in pairs i was lucky to have a friend to take me to see the eiffel tower lights shining there beautiful light it on at exactly at 1:00 am its worth staying up love it,1
eiffel tower is the most iconic monument of paris city and you must visit it atleast twice -lrb- once during the day and once at night -rrb- .,1
"200 steps , but worth it -rrb-",1
the queue for the stairs to climb the tower was non existent for those young hearty souls .,1
it is an amazing piece of engineering .,1
we we to the very top .,1
try and go during the day and the night .,1
"do n't miss the view from the trocadero , and check out the tower at night , as it sparkles for 5 minutes every hour on the hour .",1
it 's the most famous place in paris and i think that every pesron that travels to that city must visit the tower !!!,1
a must see at least once .,1
must climb to tick off that landmark list .,1
it still amazes me how m. eiffel managed to construct such a magnificent tower so many years ago ... & it 's still standing !,1
we were in line by 8am and we were probably about # 50 in line .,1
mandatory tourist attraction for paris but worthwhile .,1
on special events it will looks so colorful on night,1
"beautiful to look at , especially when lit up at night .",1
we paid to skip the line on an evening eiffel tower tour .,1
"got there , no place for my wife to wait as she did like the height .",1
but on the way to the 3 rd floor and beck to the ground was extremely crowded .,1
we had a nice picnic there .,1
"this is a mob scene and there are swarms of people selling all sorts of this , disoriented tourists , big tour groups , and ... well , there it is in front of you , the eiffel tower .",1
the 360 views of paris and river are magnificent .,1
located in one fast moving city with a lot of foreigners .,1
tips from me careful from who come close to you and asking `` do you speak english ? '',1
tour of the tower was full of fear and i felt a bad tourist atmosphere ...,1
a series of 2 elevators bring you to the summit for an unforgettable view of paris .,1
it is essential that you book in advance because waiting lines can be up to 5 hours .,1
there are some nice displays including one that presents cities named paris outside of france .,1
nice experience,1
we did a seine river tour right after .,1
the combination of a rainy day and the euro 2016 fan zone at the base of the eiffel tower meant we could walk on to the tour with no line or waiting .,1
"my first time visitors spent exactly 2 hours waiting to go up with their reserved ticket , visiting the different observation decks and waiting to come back down .",1
we just walked away and you know it was a scam as they did n't try to stop us .,1
it was closed due to national strike .,1
"having climbed the tower as a child , i paid for the skip the queue elevator this time for the 2nd level .",1
everywhere you look has awesome view .,1
it was simply fantastic .,1
"very romantic , the lines are horrible , but the view is one of a kind .",1
would highly recommend you take the metro to trocadero station and walk towards the tower from there .,1
this is a must see when in paris .,1
photos do no justice to this icon .,1
gets really crowded sometimes but it is worth it .,1
the time we chose was around 8.15 .,1
"when lit it is beautiful , appearing soft as lace yet grand , as it looms over the champs de mars .",1
"frankly its a good place , maybe because so much of hype found it good but not excellent .",1
but the view of paris is phenomenal and the eiffel tower is an icon .,1
our heads were spinning when we nery and such a lot way up but the scereached the top .,1
it is also used to welcome foreign heads of state and to symbolize tragedy in the world .,1
to see the surrounding one can go to montparnasse tower to get a better view including the eiffel tower .,1
so typical french and only to recommend !,1
my husband and i got to ride down just the two of us .,1
we did n't go up the tower so i ca n't speak to that but it was good to see in person .,1
however i suggest you reserve your tickets .,1
learn how the tower operates and how it was built and is maintained .,1
this was a fun walk from the west end hotel .,1
be sure to see it at night and choose a weekday if possible to avoid the queues !,1
"the lights at night were amazing , well worth a visit during the day and night .",1
best times for pictures are usually mornings or evenings .,1
we avoided bad queues by going on a sunday morning .,1
this is a must see if your in paris .,1
if someone is too close then think why ???,1
"the lifts are very crowded , however , a lot of people seemed to get off on the first floor , where there is a restaurant .",1
"we were part of a small tour group , which i normally do not seek out .",1
beautiful gardens and restaurants within two blocks of the tower and it was lovely even in february .,1
we were fortunate that we had good weather .,1
"we timed it perfectly , so that we were there when the lights came on -lrb- once it is dark , they are turned on for 5 mins on the hour , every hour until 1am -rrb- .",1
"lots of street venders selling crepes , mulled wine , hot chocolate etc. .",1
it 's just like being out of a movie,1
i went iceskating while there .,1
"it was good from all my experience that i travelled to most the tallest tower in the world -lrb- good view bad food , that 's was my experience from before -rrb- .",1
we had a room with a view of the tower which is light up nightly until 1 am and on the hour every hour it goes from its normal beautiful amber glow to sparkling from top to bottom for ten minutes !,1
we visited the eiffel tower in the early evening for dinner and it was just fabulous .,1
the most famous icon in the world .,1
we had a pass to skip the whole queue so we did n't have to wait .,1
"views was amazing , the bar on the first floor is so trendy and such a good vibe .",1
"great view from the top , during night it ; s shining and it 's even more incredible .",1
amazing by day - stunning by night !,1
"tourist numbers crashed the weekend of the atrocities , but still they come to marvel .",1
the surrounds are impressive parklands with the seine river as a significant back drop .,1
"the views were remarkable , all the twinkling lights of the parisian streets below were just magical :--rrb- it was cold and windy , and beautifully romantic !",1
definetly a must to do when in paris,1
were n't disappointed with the eiffel tower .,1
i must say visiting eiffel tower was one of the highlight in visiting paris !,1
a stay in paris is not complete without a visit to the eiffel tower .,1
hey ! -rrb- -rrb-,1
"a must see structure when visiting paris , it is always a pleasure to see and visit .",1
you just get many more options for viewing ...,1
obviously you do n't need to read a review to visit the eiffel tower !,1
up close its seedy and the lines are long and you are pestered with vendors .,1
this attraction was definitely the best part of our stay in paris .,1
try twice : once by day and once by night .,1
go right to the top .,1
"my kids , who are not the most patient were mesmerized by just being there , under the eiffel tower , waiting , taking pictures .",1
amazing must see .,1
"i have been up during the daytime as well as the night - i ca n't say which is better , but do n't miss going up !!",1
love saying that i 've been up the eiffel tower !!,1
"however , the view from the top is stunning , the architecture is a modern marvel , and anyone traveling to paris would be remiss if they did not go up to the top of the eiffel tower .",1
"crowded , expensive and worth it ... once !",1
"the park in front is crowded and unfortunately not cleaned very well , lots of garbage strewn around .",1
this time i just wanted to go by to take some pictures of it lit up after dark .,1
the inner corners on level 1 are clear so be prepared to walk over them and see all the way down or try to avoid if you think this would scare you .,1
i went to see this tower in the day and at night .,1
we booked and reserved on the official eiffel tower website i think 60 days in advance ?!,1
would not have wanted to wait 2 hours - so glad we lucked out .,1
must not miss this landmark .,1
for a ` cliche ' type experience it certainly was absolutely incredible .,1
"i have been to tour eiffel before although every visit seems different for instance this time around i did n't just walk under it , it is a major security detail before entering , come prepared to wait and know where you want to g and how long to cause less hassle .",1
it gives me the sense that i am `` there '' more than any other sight -lrb- or site -rrb- does .,1
the view is something else entirely .,1
took the city wonders tour of the eiffel tower .,1
best views from afar,1
have not been to paris for 25 plus years and was a bit sad to see it like this .,1
"we did not make a reservation to go t to the top because we were afraid it might not be a clear day but when we awoke to a sunny morning we went down around 10 am , got in line , bought tickets and were at the top 45 minutes later !",1
we arrived about 4pm it was really long to.kine up for a ticket .,1
get skip the line though as you will be waiting forever to get in .,1
it is a great view at all levels .,1
"during the day it is nice , but at night it is amazing !",1
it was very windy and the weather was n't the greatest but it was well worth the cost to beat the lines and see the view from the top .,1
we took photos and purchased champagne for the toast .,1
the ice-skating rink on the second floor amazed me and children will love skating there .,1
we enjoyed the various views of paris .,1
one of the best places in the world !,1
i had the feeling of `` my dream comes true '' when i was standing in front of it .,1
oh my gosh !!!,1
obvioulsy this is a must see in paris and it does not dissappoint - a stunning piece of architecture - recommend to see at night as well as during the day,1
i came to paris for a long weekend and of course the first thing on my list was the eiffel tower !,1
we went up just at the beginning of dusk and saw sunset while at the top .,1
as we heard and looking in pictures from childhood was better than that .,1
"nightmare to get on the lifts has they are always full , but what do you expect for a amazing tour .",1
on the way up if your going to the top you go straight to the 2nd floor and swap over for a different lift .,1
we wait around 40 minutes making the line over there .,1
try to avoid the tower key chain sellers as you exit .,1
enjoy it from a distance .,1
"the downside to booking in advance is that you ca n't control your visit date/timing according to the weather , as the visibility is pretty low during rains in paris .",1
absolutely stunning view esp when the sparkle lights up the tower at night the tower lights up in the first 5 mins of every hour so make sure to catch that !,1
expensive champagne and meals on the first level .,1
also be cautious whilst in that particular area as it is full of pick pockets and con artists !,1
take the time to fully explore all the levels !,1
"beware as there are pickpockets around , typically trying to get you to sign a petition or survey - just ignore them and walk past .",1
make sure you visit .,1
paid to go to the first level by lift but to go to the top you need to queue a second time once you get to the first level .,1
they said it was because ...,1
fantastic structure to view both day & night .,1
the line up to get to next level was like being a cattle waiting to be slaughtered - no way out .,1
very interesting tour guide and fantastic knowledge throughout the entire trip .,1
pre book your tickets to avoid getting stuck in queues .,1
just have common sense and be careful to avoid pickpocketing and you 'll have a lovely night .,1
we spent a few hours at the eiffel tower in august .,1
"i have never been to paris before , so of course i had to visit the eiffel tower .",1
then go to eiffel by subway from clincy city .,1
there is a way to avoid the queues without paying for an expensive private or semi-private tour run by a third party operator !,1
the view of the eiffel tower at night is something that everyone should not miss ...,1
absolutely crowded but a marvelous spectacle .,1
"from it 's ornate iron work to breathtaking views , you wo n't be disappointed .",1
if you go to paris you can not miss visiting the eiffel tower .,1
ours knew all about the history of the tower and paris .,1
i found going up in the water propelled lifts fast and efficient .,1
"do note that security is strict , do n't bring a water bottle if you are coming here .",1
inside the eiffel tower there 's also much to see and do .,1
wonderful to see on the segway .,1
we really wanted to go up the tower but sad to say because of all the terrorist attacks that happened in paris the area has largely been cordoned off during our visit .,1
the ticket to the sommet is 17 euros per adult and the price is really worth for the view you you get at 280m high .,1
"if you are travelling in paris , make sure you see the eiffiel tower because it is the main landmark of paris .",1
the best time to go to the top is just around sunset so you get to see paris by daylight and also as it gets dark you can see the same in lights .,1
it is a fantastic structure and although the queues can be long -lrb- upto 1.5 hours -rrb- it is worrh it .,1
the summit is especially crowded with little space for the long lines so there 's a lot of cutting in line .,1
"though the queue is long but when you reach the top , you will forget the long waiting hour .",1
we did n't obtain tickets in advance as we were advised and did n't expect to be able to take the trip to the top .,1
i made it to the eiffel tower and it was everything i thought it would be .,1
"when one is in paris , it is only standard to visit the eiffel tower !",1
"good grass behind it if the weather is nice , next to the river so a boat ride is on the cards as well .",1
"do n't miss the lights at night , for the first 5 minutes every hour there is a light show .",1
staff were pleasant .,1
nice cafe and restaurant up stairs which is n't very over priced considering the location and the view .,1
"the eiffel tower is spectacular and the views from it are very nice , but this is it .",1
thank goodness they did n't take it down .,1
the only thing i would strongly advise is that you book your tickets in advance online before coming .,1
we had the top open on the bus which was nice .,1
reasonably priced too .,1
we visited the iron lady at sunset time and the view is breathtaking !,1
"it 's a work out , but some interesting views on the way up .",1
it is incredible .,1
have to be in a long queue to purchase tickets to reach up .,1
"we went to the top again had to wait in queues part the way up to get to the next level , it was very cold and windy up the top so recommend taking a jacket or sweatshirt .",1
s i waited for my credit card after paying my tab .,1
top is closed for a month .,1
an absolute must .,1
"i dont mean to say you should give this a miss , in fact , you should really go to the bottom of the tower and just marvel at it , but really at the top , you will realise you are done much faster than you think .",1
"i think you just ended up to visit here if you walk along seine , and this will be the right place if you do n't have any idea about where to go .",1
"it was extremely beautiful lit up in red , white and blue .",1
make sure you have no bottle with your as you 'll need to leave it behind .,1
visited many times but feb 2010 actually went up and visited the restaurant .,1
she handed out maps and guide pens that were interactive with the map .,1
the eiffel tower looked beautiful .,1
"still , the tower looks amazing in the evening and spectacular when it does that shimmery sparkling light up .",1
"we went up the eiffel tower during the weekend at school half term , myself , wife and 6 year old daughter .",1
we climbed up all the way to the top using the stairs and that was a mistake - lol take the elevators when you can !,1
paris is a great city and the view from the eiffel tower is the best one .,1
the show lasts about 5 minutes and is amazing !,1
"it was wet , windy and unseasonably cold when i visited eiffel tower for the first time .",1
"long queues and long queues , the queues actually ruin the experience of going up the tower to enjoy the view , if you are a laid back tourist , admiring the eiffel tower from afar is something you will appreciate .",1
"we paid a ridiculous price for champagne at the top -lrb- but again , why not ? -rrb-",1
"never the less it was well worth the visit and although we only went to the 2nd level , the views of paris were magnificent .",1
i think it was about 20 minutes ... .,1
steps not too bad although lift some of the way also an option .,1
expect an extraordinary line .,1
excellent views at the top .,1
i was wrong !,1
we went on a monday morning about 10am and waited 10 mins max 15 euros to the top good value imho .,1
we got to the top as the sun set !,1
"if you were n't able to get advanced ticket , go at night .",1
excellent views once you get up there though ...,1
its really one of the best wonder of the world out of seven .,1
"if you go to the tower , make sure you go right up to the top .",1
we were hoping to go to the top but the wait in line was was too long .,1
it goes without saying that the tower is a global icon .,1
the queue going up was quite long so we skipped it .,1
"my son and i visited the tower for his 30th birthday , it is quite an overwhelming presence .",1
even if you do n't go up the tower its good to go and see it its so big and majestic and plenty of places to eat and drink and just admire this iconic structure,1
"from an initial price offer of 15 euros , we bought it at 5 euros .",1
for a family of four it cost us roughly # 22 & the whole expereince took us about 3 hours !!,1
this is my second trip to the eiffel tower and it was just as special as the first time .,1
once up worth it for the fantastic views .,1
i am glad we did it as i 've said it 's now got a tick on accomplished,1
we booked the behind the scenes tour through the eiffel tower 's website and were able to get some unique views and backstory of the tour .,1
it 's true height only really appreciated when you 're beside it .,1
professional organization and huge time saving .,1
carolina and riano schegherastein .,1
every hour on the hour it sparkles for about 5 minutes .,1
we were disappointed that they no longer let you walk underneath it unless you are taking a trip to the top .,1
as a family we had lots of fun exploring and discovering ... and then visiting some of the places we saw from the eiffel tower .,1
we got to the half way point all was fine .,1
it ai n't the same .,1
we arrived as they were opening and did n't experience long queues which was a bonus .,1
you will love it .,1
but its always very crowded .,1
as you take a long walk toward the eiffel tower to get your tickets you walk next to a beautiful long stride of green grass and find many people trying to sell you souvenirs .,1
give yourself time to get through as the lines can be long even in winter .,1
something not to be missed .,1
our visit was fantastic .,1
there is impossible to add something - just take a champagne directly at the top of this monument & be ready to strongest winds .,1
we stayed around the base of the tower to relax and had a picnic .,1
security has increased .,1
our favorite is from pont alma -lrb- near alma metro -rrb- - and you can get the replica of the statue of liberty 's torch in the foreground .,1
well this is my seventh time but still i get goosebumps when i think of the height of this tower .,1
the sight of the tour eiffel is exquisite !,1
"first queue for security check moves fast , but it takes hours to get to the ticket and elevator .",1
seen it a thousand times in print but it is so much more amazing in person .,1
be prepared for a ton of hawkers pushing their wares but ignore them and enjoy the view .,1
avoid the que and skip the line .,1
its must watch at day and night .,1
"i personally recommend you to go with someone and buy yourself a glass of champagne and have a toast up there , the views of the city are amazing and also amazing if you are lucky and there is mist too !",1
do n't waste money at the restaurant .,1
awesome but were very windy and cold .,1
"it 's been a good ten years since i last went up the tower , despite having been to paris a few times since then .",1
"this time we did not go to the top , but it does offer a dramatic panoramic view of paris .",1
we went in early evening and were on the tower when it sparked for the first time that night .,1
a ticket to the top with a lift costs 17 euros .,1
this was my first trip here and the sheer size was way bigger than i could have ever imagined .,1
we visited during the euros and came here almost everyday to the fan park .,1
there are signs around saying `` for your own safety do n't buy anything from the street vendors '' - have to assume that pickpockets are everywhere too .,1
"why wait in a line , wasting time in the most beautiful city ?!?!",1
lots of energy in the surrounding area and a nice walk or bus etc from the louvre .,1
the view of the eiffel tower is second only to the views from the eiffel tower !,1
"the ride up is fun , i would have love to go to the top but my husband decline , i strongly regret not going by myself .",1
they were quite long queues getting on to the lifts so i was glad i had prebooked back in the uk which led us into a separate much shorter queue .,1
"the museum is massive and one can probably cover a small part in a few hours.everything about the museum is grand , exquisite and historical",1
i visited paris and the eiffel tower 16 years ago and it was an amazing and exiting experience .,1
"there is not much to do in the immediate surroundings , but easy to get to by metro .",1
"look beyond the disorganization , the lamentable need for security checks , the long lines ; rather , ponder the 19th century achievement the tower represents and its present role as a true french , indeed global , iconic symbol .",1
we had maybe a 10 minute wait .,1
"of course this is a must-do for many people but if you 'd rather not deal with the massive line-ups and crowds during the summer , go to the arc de triomphe or sacred couer for city views for much less money and without the large crowds .",1
if it had n't of been for that it would have really been fantastic .,1
a lot less beggars than my last visit - maybe due to the euros .,1
"we felt safe , maybe even safer because there were n't throngs of tourists and possible pick pockets .",1
elevators are a great thing !,1
the view was worth it and the cute champagne bar added to the occasion .,1
what amazed me is how the massive structure was constructed !!!,1
then we enjoyed the view .,1
the eiffel tower is beautiful with the climb up is awful .,1
apologies for the shouting .,1
to see the city of lights from the top at night is something to cheer about .,1
+ beautiful !,1
wow ... what a beautiful piece of architecture .,1
"it was nice to stop on the 1st floor for a little bit , rest , have a drink or play some games they have out .",1
i can now say i have experienced paris and its fine architecture .,1
"there is also a lighted billboard warning everyone not to buy anything from street merchants , who are a bunch of hustlers selling miniature tin replicas of the eiffel tower .",1
"ok , i am way too cool to gush about going to the eiffel tower .",1
this was something i wanted to do and did it .,1
"this happened at 10 p.m , 11 p.m and 12 a.m and only for 5 minutes",1
buy your tickets beforehand if you intend to go up to the top .,1
it was a dull day but still worth the time and effort,1
"we expected long queues for the tickets so we bought our tickets in advance but what we didn ´ t expect at all that in the second floor we would have to change from one lift to another and had to stay in a terrible queue again , more than hour .",1
"mothers in law , fathers , mothers , kids , grand kids all love it and the restaurant for lunch or dinner is the best idea .",1
"a must see while in paris , even better to just sit on the grass below , with a sandwich and some vine and enjoy the view of the tower and people passing by .",1
do n't need to do it again .,1
i 'd post a picture but i do n't want to ruin the surprise .,1
if in paris a must see .,1
it would be best to go up during evening time and wait ...,1
expensive but you have to see it .,1
understandable .,1
you just have to experience the tower if you are in paris .,1
"of course not , it takes you to the second floor , you walk out , new queue which takes you to the first floor where you again have to walk out and go through the gift shops and other distractions and then finally get down .",1
"we heard a lot of this tower and we are unable to say more about this , it is wonderful .",1
i loved seeing the et from a bridge on the seine .,1
"queue went down quickly even though it was long , and we climbed up instead of using the lift which did n't take as long as expected .",1
also go when the sun is setting .,1
we went day and night and just enjoyed the view .,1
"tourism during the months of october , november , and december is pretty low , so you can get to the location quite easily , take pictures with ease , stroll at your own pace .",1
"we started to climb up at about 5pm , this is the best time to start since u get the sunset from above .",1
ice skating ?,1
"however , if you are a last minute traveller , no worries , keep one whole day for eiffel tower .",1
do n't miss a visit to the summit .,1
three generations of our family had a special treat with a christmas eve visit to the tower .,1
save time by buying your tickets online and getting your hotel to print it out for you .,1
"a must-see , at least once .",1
it 's all diamond memories .,1
maybe it was because we had over expectations .,1
i 'd suggest going only to the second level - you get the same view and not as much wind/cold .,1
"unforgettable place , a romantic place , wonderful view from the tower of the city , the evening glow is simply mesmerizing .",1
we have visited it befoe many times and we will do it again and again and again !,1
"it is so incredibly beautiful , especially at night when the lights are defining its unique shape in the parisian skyline .",1
well it is .,1
we skipped the huge lines .,1
of course the line for the elevator was longer than the line for the stairs .,1
"unfortunately , the place is nearly always crowded , and there are plenty of cheap knick-knacks as well as pick-pockets -lrb- the latter mostly a summer plague -rrb- .",1
get a tour of the mechanical room and underground rooms including passes directly to the second floor .,1
la tour eiffel/eiffel tower is timeless and will always be impressive .,1
"its expensive but a must see if you go to paris , its worth the cost .",1
"i really liked visiting the second floor of eiffel tower at night , we were the last group going up at 11 pm and it was so nice and romantic , the weather was wonderful , and you can enjoy the nice view of paris city from the top .",1
"so be careful , if your trip is during the cold months , specialty when you are at the top waiting to down .",1
worth every minute pushed up against total strangers and wondering what exactly is that smell !,1
this site is so amazing you dare not miss it if you are in paris .,1
the ice skating is free .,1
very knowledgeable and friendly .,1
you can just walk through metal objects .,1
locals and tourists alike end up snacking/picnicking .,1
you ca n't fault the eiffel tower !,1
well worth staying up to see the light display after dark,1
you have to go to the very top of the eiffeltower .,1
and line up and line up some more .,1
we saw the eiffel tower during the day and then planned a return visit for that evening .,1
"after visiting paris 3 times i must say that i love the eiffel tower , but it can actually be better to see it further away than to try to go on top ... .",1
it is simply breathtaking ?,1
the view from the top is spectacular and we worked our way slowly downwards .,1
if we had our time again we would have walked down to the first floor into the enclosed area which was warmer and had the museum display .,1
we went all the way up and admired the view .,1
if you are lucky the water cannons will be shooting into the reflecting pool .,1
"then walk down , go across the bridge and stand under this marvel .",1
i loved this trip .,1
"at night , the tower sparkles with a multitude of flashing lights , which is beautiful .",1
i had great expectations but was sadly disappointed .,1
"the best place to view it , in my opinion , is trocadero .",1
we went to the eiffel tower as part of my 30th birthday trip .,1
you disembark the first lift and work your way up to the summit lift .,1
the view from the top is spectacular once you get past the hyperventilating stage .,1
the lights go on at 7 pm .,1
"we were lucky enough to find a `` skip-the-line '' tour through viator , which is an associate company of tripadvisor .",1
we went all the way up - to the tundra .,1
the elevator goes up to reach 284 m pretty fast but you wo n't feel dizzy .,1
it is great use of your time and money .,1
"the tower by itself is remarkable , its stories , legends and project are absolutely awesome .",1
"we visited this on a cold dreary morning , the tower was partly hidden in the mist , this did not diminish the experience .",1
allow more than 1/2 a day .,1
the souvenirs were just the same as on the high-street and i just did n't enjoy it as much as i thought .,1
visit the wonder of the world eiffel tower in september 2016 and it was really an amazing experience .,1
it drew us away from our hotel the evening we arrived in paris .,1
"but , glad i did it !",1
"unparalleled view , no picture can describe .",1
over all it 's a must yes !!,1
husband and i decided to take an improptu visit to the paris with no kids and it was amazing .,1
the tower itself now has fences all around the base so you ca n't get close to it like you used to be able to -lrb- unless you pay to go in -rrb- .,1
"too many people , its crowded and tourists are pushy .",1
sign of the times .,1
i was surprised at how impressed i was at the eiffel tower and highly recommend it .,1
"the good thing of pre booking is that you skip the queues and i would recommend that once you get to the second platform you head straight for the third as you the miss the hordes of people and have the opportunity of walking around the who , e area without too much difficulty .",1
after walking around paris all day we decided to walk up the eiffel tower because the lifts were way too busy .,1
they say you get a great view of paris .,1
beautiful from the gardens below also .,1
i would say that you do n't have to be very fit to be able to walk up the stairs and my 6 year old did not have any problem either .,1
"the light show every hour at night was a great treat , daytime views over paris were wonderful .",1
of course you 're in paris how could not see the eiffel tower .,1
then even more waiting in line on the second platform to pay even more euros to wait in another line for another hour to get to the third platform .,1
look if you visit paris you must go up to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
the south pier was for tickets only for those walking to the second level .,1
tower itself is so incredibly beauty with sparkling lights ... love it !,1
"you could easily read up on it before you visit , though .",1
"great to spend a few hours up here , plenty to see on level 2 , walk or ride down to level 1 , lovely bar area and space to chill take plenty of water with you its 5 $ a litre for water at up at level 1 & 2 .",1
tickets to summit can be purchased at level 1 as well .,1
we took a tour with a tour group mainly so we could skip the lines to get in and up to the top .,1
"we have always skipped the eiffel tower in paris when just me and my husband , but the kids were dying to go .",1
it is better at night when the tower is lit up.the line is not as long and it goes much faster .,1
a lot of queueing both at the bottom and the 2nd platform and the usual european pushing in but overall well worth the price and a visit .,1
get there early or go at night if you do n't want to wait as long .,1
the amount of time we were followed men trying to sell us stuff and not listening even after we said ` we have no money ' ruined the experience .,1
we went to the summit of the eiffel tower on my birthday july 23 .,1
"it 's definitely a modern wonder , the surrounding area is great to experience and if you 're in paris you have to visit it , but do n't feel like you have to go up it !",1
make it a point to have a picnic outside the tower one day -lrb- theres a food place nearby where you can pre-order and then pick up lunches - really useful-cant recall the name guys so sorry -rrb- and enjoy the scenary around and then makeee suureeee to come out at night .,1
then at night while cruising the illumination night cruise we took more pictures .,1
"a lot of warnings about pick-pockets , but we always use hidden money belts and zippered pockets .",1
luckily we did n't have to wait in a queue also we took the stairs to the first and second floor and bought the summit tickets from the second floor in return saving some euros :p .,1
this was our anniversary and therefore we were extravagant .,1
i was disappointed by this action that he gave me .,1
it is a signature attraction and icon of any city anywhere in the world .,1
it is breath taking to see this marvel and it is the back drop for a beautiful city .,1
the ultimate parisian icon !,1
it is fabulous .,1
although lunch seemed to go very quickly it was a great experience and would fully recommend .,1
"unless you 're eating at one of the restaurant inside , this attraction can be a quick visit .",1
the city if beautiful designed and the eiffel tower is not far from the river ; it 's literally within walking distance .,1
"but , we never really saw the tower itself .",1
i never get tired of seeing the eiffel tower - either up close or from a distance across the city .,1
we did lots of research and bought our tickets in advance because of all of the warnings of crowds and lines .,1
the queues can get long so a pre booking can be useful if its not good weather .,1
"if you go up to the deck outside part , it can get very windy , maybe take a little sweater .",1
went there when there was cold and there were less tourists than usual .,1
it was great experience .,1
"also , they have beware of pick pocketer signs , so it does n't feel very safe , but like i said , you ca n't go to paris and not see the eiffel tower : -rrb-",1
eiffel tower is so tall and magnificent that it looks very near wherever i see it but its actually not near !,1
we arrived before 10 and the queue was negligible .,1
heavy security .,1
we did the jules verne restaurant which gets you access to the second floor ... while we could n't go to the top this was definitely high enough .,1
beware of the people that approach you trying to sell you something or looking for money .,1
the view was still amazing.be prepared to barter with sellers of souvenirs .,1
it is much bigger than i thought !,1
"saw it at night from the seine , from the park , saw it twinkling on the hour .",1
"not necessarily for going all the way up to the top , but for the `` megality '' of the construction when you stand underneath !",1
make sure to visit trocadero to get some lovely pictures !,1
"if you want to get a better price but also nice food , may be a bit further away from the tower would be good .",1
going up the middle of an open structure in a lift is quite an experience .,1
the view of paris is amazing .,1
eiffel tower crowded every time we visit great tower of steel i like its views an the location lovely park surrounding the tower also i like the crepe kiosk,1
what else is there to say ... one of the most popular attractions in the world ... it was everything i was expecting it to be and more,1
plenty of food options in the area to enjoy some bread and wine in the shadows of this incredible site .,1
i highly recommend buying a ticket online prior to your trip because the line to buy tickets during peak tourism season can be very long .,1
"while one is talking to you another will distract and try to take your purse , bags or wallets .",1
"went for lunch up the tower , was definitely worth it .",1
"let 's face it folks , the eiffel tower is beautiful , romantic and awe inspiring .",1
"we have waited in a long line to get to see the world renowned eiffel tower ... honestly i thought it was just average but really not worth wasting all this time waiting in line to get up there ... if there is not much crowd , then it could be interesting to check out , if not , you 'll be wasting precious time that you could use to do lots of more interesting places in pairs ... on the other hand , we had a good chance of getting a clear weather so the view from the top was unobstructed & really nice",1
visiting the eiffel tower at night is a must do in paris .,1
but waiting this really pays of well .,1
it is huge iron tower .,1
we took a boat trip down the seine after our meal which i would highly recommend .,1
"if this is your first time going to the tower , i would also suggest going to the summit -lrb- the views are worth it -rrb- although you will be taking a gamble because of the weather .",1
was able to skip the line .,1
it was magnificent !,1
whew !,1
or through lift must get on line ticket otherwise you will waste maximum of your time in queue for ticket .,1
please buy tickets from authorised site at 11 euros upto second floor .,1
"we had a meeting time at a statue , so no queue .",1
we cued for no more than 10 minutes to buy tickets and get in .,1
as you approach it from a cruise on seine it is spectacular .,1
whole paris in front of you .,1
"also the price seemed exceptionally reasonable when compared to the empire state building , or the cn tower , or other such attractions .",1
get tickets to ride the lifts up to the top before you leave home or from your hotel or you will spend a long time in line .,1
it looks a bit dull during the day but at night time it 's spectacular .,1
stunning tower and stunning views .,1
you ca n't really appreciate the eiffel tower unless you are there .,1
it 's just good to sit and relax watching the crowd busy taking snaps .,1
we did variations of these activities over a few days .,1
beautiful and interesting .,1
at that level they have glass panels in the floor that you can walk on if you are bold enough .,1
"imp : please go online and book tickets in advance , else you will spend one hour plus in the cue waiting to get in !",1
there is a sea of people trying to access it at any given time .,1
at night the lights flash and it is quite the sight to see .,1
this guaranteed us `` skip the line '' tickets to the 2nd floor and we were assured we could buy tickets to the summit once we reached the 2nd floor .,1
the wait was not long at all .,1
one of my reasons to go to paris was to go up eiffel tower .,1
once in the que its hard to find nearby toilets for little ones .,1
lunch at the eiffel tower was absolutely wonderful .,1
you like it or not it is so strongly linked to the name of paris that yiu will feel like having missed it all if you do n't go .,1
"thankfully , the queue was n't huge when i went & i timed it perfectly to witness a bit of a sunset on what had been a day of mixed weather .",1
if you want to eat at the restaurant one must make a reservation .,1
should be a great party .,1
"though the nearest train staiton to the tower is bir hakeim , alight at trocedero and walk towards the tower for the perfect view .",1
eiffel tower should be witnessed live .,1
this is seriously one of the coolest attractions i 've ever been to .,1
as is the line bypass tours which we did for all attractions .,1
they turn off about 1am and then the place is a ghost town .,1
we did n't pre-book and went with our stroller on a particularly cold and rainy day .,1
"the positive : view was great on the second floor , and it 's only marginally better at the top , so would think twice before shelling out more to buy that ticket to the top .",1
it was well worth it not to have to stand on line for 3-4 hours in the very hot paris sun .,1
"unless you book 2 months in advance and get a guide forget the thought of going up , pointless unless your a avid disneyland queuer as its absurd in the heart of the summer .",1
the eiffel tower is an iron lattice tower located in champs de mars .,1
can not wait to return .,1
beautiful and the restaurant is superb,1
virtually no queue at security or the ticket office but once we were through that it was just queue after queue .,1
been up the burj khalifa but this is ten times more impressive .,1
we met a few blocks away with our tour guide -lrb- and i ca n't remember her name for the life of me -rrb- .,1
"another box ticked off the list , but it is way more than that .",1
book your tickets online from the official website and no lines !,1
"the view is great but having climbed many towers all over the world , i did n't think the eiffel had much more to offer .",1
you will have your breath taken from you .,1
"visited on a semi clear day , small amount of clouds and you could see everything !",1
with reserving a time also makes you vulnerable to weather conditions .,1
we went towards dusk in october and the wait was n't too bad .,1
this iconic site is truly beautiful and you have breath-tasking views of paris from.both the first level and from.the summit .,1
"unlike the empire state , the open , exposed victorian framework makes for a much more edgy experience .",1
very annoying hawkers outside so watch your purse and make sure to say `` non ! '',1
at the louvre to your list of must dos as well !!,1
buy the ticket for access to all the levels and check out a good bit of the city from all four sides -lrb- although you can get great views from the second level if you do n't want to go all the way to the top -rrb- .,1
there were armed guards all over paris too which made us feel very safe .,1
"i toured the eiffel tower by day , on a foggy , misty morn when the pinnacle top was barely seen .",1
must see for paris first timers though !,1
"and the ` grassed ' area is totally deplorable , no grass just dirt and litter everywhere and street vendors hassling everyone to buy .",1
"the eiffel tower is one of the most lovely place , i 've ever visited .",1
we took a guided tour with city wonders .,1
how can you not see it while in paris .,1
you just stand in awe .,1
if you want to buy the ticket in advance you will skip the line and it could save you at least one hour if not more .,1
"which is great , with all the things going on in the world today .",1
"very frustrating experience trying to get down from the third level , huge line and no help from employees as there is none to be found unless you are in a store or cafe .",1
"as the instructions say on the lid : book in advance , the lines are extensively long and on a saturday afternoon we waited 2 hours to buyt our tickets , by the time we got to the top of the line the top floor was closed and we were told to cue at the second floor once we got up to buy the top floor tickets",1
"a must see but now hard to get photos due to the fencing and security all around the tower , understand why but does n't make for the picturesque views of the past",1
"some of the most exciting things to see are the arc de triomphe , les invalides , the louvre , the pantheon , notre-dame and the seine .",1
arrived at the place des invalids and sat on the grass .,1
"afterward , we went back up and there was no longer a line , so we went to the third level .",1
when in paris this is a must see !,1
the view is amazing !!!,1
there very tight security almost like and airport so anything you really do n't need do n't take .,1
their signage is a little bit lacking & should have more staff .,1
the eiffel tower was very cool .,1
what is paris without going to the eiffel tower - really ?,1
eiffel tower is obversely you will visit .,1
travel up in the lift for a great view of paris great place to take photos it was our second trip to the tower but we still enjoyed it again,1
"there is a cafe , shop here .",1
"go to the entrances marked with green flags , indicating admission for those with advance tickets .",1
if you do go up then by all means eat beforehand at a cafe nearby .,1
we were there in the first week of may and it was very cold and strong breeze was there at the top .,1
we were able to skip the huge line that was there .,1
"when i first set eyes on the eiffel tower , i was filled with delight as i had waited a very long time to see this famed monument .",1
"if you know your schedule , book your ticket online and skip the lines !",1
next time i am going to visit at night .,1
worth the wait .,1
many people climb to the top for the perfect view .,1
you can see the whole city of paris from the top and if you take the elevator you can stop to have crapes midway up .,1
"the day was sunday , a free parking day .",1
worth a visit although we did n't go up this time .,1
"i think it is very important to visit this beautiful landmark while in paris but the lines were very long in length , while they moved fairly fast .",1
there is nothing more french or parisian than the eiffel tower ... great architecture and even more impressive up close when you can appreciate its scale ...,1
unfortunately time did not permit waiting in line to go up the tower so it will wait until a future visit - most ideally with my husband in the city of love .,1
we have been to paris on several occasions before but only now managed to climb the eiffel tower .,1
i visited paris from basel -lrb- switzerland -rrb- .,1
"had the option of taking the lift back down if we wanted , however we decided to take the stairs for the experience .",1
the views are incredible and there is less people than during day,1
"well ... this is la tour eiffel , what else ?!",1
"visiting in february you can only buy tickets online for level 2 which was ideal for me , as i was n't sure what to expect .",1
at the very top was loads of people and was a bit cramped .,1
do a bit of reading on the history of the tower - it is really interesting - so much opposition to it initially .,1
... could n't believe in my eyes the view from the top is amazing !,1
it 's a 45 minute wait in the que to get up but worth it .,1
all kinds of people congregate here : the good and the shady .,1
"plan your trip , book online .",1
by 1120 they were kicking us out but we had taken all the photo 's and taken in all the sites .,1
we came back in evening to get a selfie from palais de chaillot with eiffel in the background .,1
"by night this landmark truly shines , especially at the top of the hour when it explodes with lights for about 5 minutes .",1
superdupernice experience walking up and down again .,1
"there are shops , snacks , and of course champagne for sale inside the tower .",1
no one can tell you how amazing the eiffel tower truly is .,1
the sheer size of the structure was impressive and we took lots of photos .,1
we decided to stay below and observe it from the ground .,1
enjoyed being there .,1
kids were pleased we made and i was pleased we made it down !,1
"our tickets were for the opening time of 9.30 am on a saturday , so were able to get in the first lift that went to the very top level .",1
"of all of the towers i have been to around the world , this one takes the cake .",1
must do for any first time visitor .,1
there are sweeping views of the city from here .,1
this level also has a souvenir shop .,1
the 2nd and 3rd levels are fantastic for providing information regarding construction and the history .,1
intriguing look thru the clear floors to the ground below !,1
well managed ticket booths and lift service for guests .,1
the champagne bar is a great idea at the top to make the most out of your sightseeing attraction .,1
did not go to the restaurant on the top floor .,1
the best time to go is at night with all the lights blazing .,1
i 'm usually afraid of heights but this was a piece of cake .,1
my husband and i decided it would be fun -lrb- and good exercise -rrb- to take the stairs up the eiffel tower .,1
the eiffel tower is a stunning sight any time of the day but especially at night .,1
"no wonder this tower become the icon of paris , or even france , it 's freaking huge !!!",1
"not that the eiffel tower needs another review , its a must see and do and why or how could you go to paris and not do it ?",1
"so amazing to go at night and see it in all its lit up glory fantastic , lifts a little scary for vertigo sufferers but magnificent .",1
so if you really want to get to the top make sure you book well in advance !,1
"it 's an increadible structure to see up close , even if you do n't go up the tower .",1
walked up the south leg to avoid as many queues .,1
"to enjoy your time at the eiffel tower , careful planning is a must !",1
gypsies are a large problem around the tower .,1
best part of paris has wide roads and place allotted to eiffel tower is very spacious .,1
not sure because we said `` top floor '' but in any case - we proceeded to wait another 45 minutes for tickets to the top .,1
"i thought it was great in the day , but at night when it 's lit up and then they out flashing lights on , wow !!",1
"i have visited paris three times in the last nine years and sadly , the terrorism threat has now changed the freedom to wander in awe , totally amazed at the structure from every possible angle , because now there are so many barriers and queues to get anywhere near it -lrb- understandably -rrb- .",1
april in paris is a beautiful thing .,1
"the day we visited it though , it took around 2 hours to get through security and the ticket booth plus the time visiting the second level .",1
absolutely amazing views .,1
lots of picture taking opportunities .,1
paris is gorgeous and beautiful !,1
i just said no in french and moved on .,1
"the tower is striking , and a must do at least one time .",1
it 's in the 16th district .,1
"the tower is lit up at night , and if you stay for a bit they turn on lights that twinkle like stars .",1
do this at night when you can see all of the lights of paris .,1
there are vendors trying to sell u a lot of things but do n't mind them if you do n't want to buy anything .,1
we want to buy a place for in paris now .,1
"it does n't matter how many times you 've seen the eiffel tower , it 's majestic !",1
the third level was optional for 6 euros each and well worth the extra cost .,1
it is absolutely amazing !,1
the day we went there was a strike so no access to the tower .,1
buy your ticket before your trip .,1
be prepared for safety checks and loads of tourists .,1
we stood at the top of trocadero and was an amazing view .,1
must visit at least once in a lifetime .,1
it is such an iconic structure that for me it is a must visit when in paris .,1
the real view is when sun sets .,1
if you 've never been to paris this is a must see !,1
in the evening is the light show .,1
would suggest to book tickets well in advance.hardly any wait time and can plan the day well .,1
"we took some awesome videos of our ride up , so i recommend doing that if you can or remember to do so .",1
"take the stairs down , such a good way to see the inner workings of the structure .",1
it 's cheaper and there was no queue when we were there .,1
the weather was perfect !,1
unforgettable sightseeings of paris could be seen .,1
"go to the top when it 's still light but approaching sunset , you get the best of seeing paris by day and the sunset , then the lights of the city .",1
my only issue was the bartender at the summit champagne bar .,1
"pre arranged a couple of weeks ahead , otherwise long lines .",1
i was really amazed at its size .,1
our hotel concierge booked it and it was good .,1
there is a really nice plaza you can take picture in it or you can walk right under the tower !,1
the eiffel tower looks different at various times of day .,1
made the obligatory trek to the eiffel tower during a two day stop over in paris in august 2016 .,1
i visited the eiffel tower on the 2nd day of my trip to paris with my 2 young children .,1
it 's not so crowded at this level as the floor space is broad however as you get higher floor space becomes less and so you will experience some crowding .,1
got to the ticket office and paid for two full tickets for ` sommet ' .,1
amazing view over paris to realise how big the city really is .,1
forced us to walk a different route and see some nice gardens !,1
"this is an amazing structure , you can spy it from all over paris , we did not take the trip to the top as the wait was to long being august it is very busy",1
good view from 2 as well as top floor .,1
and eiffel tower looks so beautiful from below ... .,1
if you are not afraid of heights .,1
we visited on a sunday morning and it was not busy .,1
"$ 2.50 , ok it was cold and refreshing , but there was little choice .",1
pay to go to the summit .,1
research the best car parks before going .,1
i 'm sure there more and less crowded times but it 's even a popular spot to meet up even for the locals .,1
after words walk along the river and continue to your romantic walk,1
i was so excited to see this in person !,1
anyone and everyone that visits paris will of course visit the eiffel tower .,1
the euro 2016 fan zone is going on at the moment so there are tons of football fans making the experience so fun and exciting !,1
and there is a cute little football hanging from the tower !,1
we had purchased tickets well in advance for june 14 .,1
however i expect it 's a different experience .,1
there is an auto purchase kiosk that is very fast and easy -lrb- 6.50 euros -rrb- .,1
that is the best way to get on the top .,1
"everyone needs to see this tower in person , at least once in their life .",1
"if you specifically looking at that time , its better to book tickets in advance for that time slot .",1
"it was raining when we had this trip to france , but we went to the eiffel tower anyway .",1
but my heart is full and happy !,1
i 've had a fascination with the eiffel tower since i was a young girl .,1
"lovely sight , bringing lovely lovely memories .",1
well worth seeing .,1
it was very cold and windy .,1
"yes , eiffel tower !",1
have climbed it three times now .,1
"it takes a while to get up there -lrb- even in winter -rrb- but once you are up , it 's definitely worth it .",1
"busy , cold , wet but it 's the eiffel tower so who cares !",1
there is also a few sections where the floor is glass and you can stand on it and look down .,1
be ready to wait and then wait again if you are going to the top .,1
but night is the best !,1
but it was amazing,1
"take the stairs if you can , to save tons of time waiting in line .",1
have been up the eiffel tower a few times but this was the first at night .,1
it was the most amazing sight we had ever seen .,1
"we decided to try the guided tour which means we had the tickets included and `` skip the lines '' access , plus access to the very top of the tower .",1
"eiffel tower is the quintessential representation of paris - and it gives you sweeping views of the city at a glance , so put it in your to-do list in your first days of your visit .",1
"you need to go twice , during the day and at night .",1
simple : do n't pre-book .,1
do not fall for the con artists !,1
"le tour de eiffel , is great .",1
"there was a special display of a large spherical `` earth '' in the center , under the tower , in honor of the climate change summit that was taking place in paris at the time .",1
you can even walk up the first section for less and then pay to catch the lift to the summit .,1
avoid peak season and peak hours when tour coaches arrive bringing in hundrends of visitors .,1
"but i have an experience want to share , do n't go in rainy-windy day.you ca n't go to the top -lrb- last floor/station close because of weather -rrb- , also if you can wind is a problem .",1
worth every cent.our guide was wonderful and his knowledge of the history of paris and the eiffel tower made the tour a great experience .,1
the lookey lookey black guys ruin it .,1
1st time visit and went to the 2nd level .,1
"you can just spend hours holding your loved one , or just simply by yourself enjoying all the scenery and enchantment of this place !",1
"great views , if never done this before deff a go see destination .",1
"amazing , huge , beautiful view but for family very expensive .",1
the walk around the tower is ok .,1
"beautiful building day or night , summer orwinter - all the time looks fantastic .",1
it is a must see .,1
impressive beyond imagination .,1
as for going up i can not say how it was .,1
if your scared of heights or it seems daunting i would get off at the 2nd floor and take a few minutes to get used to it and then head to the top .,1
it is definitely something special to see !,1
one can save a great deal of money by buying tickets from the eifffel website at least a week or two before planned visit .,1
visited mid august ' 15 .,1
i was astonished to see how beautiful it is .,1
"i 'm sure this sounds foolish , but i wore a baseball-type hat , which allowed me to wait in line under the tower and not see the looming structure overhead that would have made me extremely nervous .",1
incredible landmark of paris .,1
we went toward the end of the day and the line was n't too bad .,1
number one : buy your tickets months in advance .,1
"and even if you are scared of heights , you must take this challenge and go up !",1
i like to help other visitors on practical matters that hopefully will enhance your visit as it did ours .,1
we did it around 4 weeks before .,1
breezed through the 2 security checkpoints and were on our way .,1
"highly recommend you make this touristy attraction , but you 'll be fine visiting just the outside .",1
worth the evening trip .,1
check it out .,1
going up the tower was a very exciting experience for my whole family .,1
it is excellent .,1
it 's better to go on a weekday if possible because the queues are less .,1
this is one of those few places in the world where you have to go .,1
it is a once a i life time place to visit .,1
today there 's ugly fencing all round the structure with turnstile access only -lrb- presume to pay -rrb- just to stand underneath this ` beauty ' .,1
the eiffel tower is so lovely .,1
it 's also perfect for a romantic stroll -- in its presence you just feel so happy and in love with whoever you 're with .,1
security is high to be expected so that makes the queuing longer .,1
nice view of the city .,1
there are benches you can sit on to just view the environment and also shops that you can grab a snack on .,1
2nd level was open but the day was so cloudy i did n't go up because i would n't have seen anything .,1
magical at night with its extra christmas light display on the hour my only regret i wasnt in paris long enough to go up the tower .,1
take note .,1
i took the steps .,1
i think it 's pretty fantastic and spectacular to look at .,1
the cost is n't cheap .,1
the moulin rouge show was excellent !,1
the boat ride in river seine is worth it while !,1
this is truly a must see .,1
"the tour was really nice , with great views , perfect staff and good food .",1
a must see for first time visitors to paris .,1
its worth paying for the ticket to the very top .,1
all of paris is laid out before you and it is quite something to see .,1
the tower just gets better with age and the french know how to make the experience one to remember without even an ounce of gaudiness .,1
"the tower is lovely just to see the books , imagine when you see it live .",1
i walked down the stairs and the view was spectacular .,1
"there 's no place in paris that is as well-recognized as the eiffel tower , or `` tour eiffel , '' as it 's known as in french .",1
"le tour is a major attraction for everyone around the world , so it will be crowded , always .",1
recent return to paris after many years and was sad to find that among other things you can no longer walk under and around the tower without paying and going through security .,1
we ended up doing an entire day trip to paris through a tour compamy while we were staying in london .,1
only mesh dividing you on this floor though .,1
"even though the eiffel tower is such an important monument , it always leaves me rather - underwhelmed .",1
"lack of weather controlling tour guides aside i enjoyed the ascent up the tower , thankfully no one proposed at the top so i did n't have to jump off in disgust .",1
"we were luckily seated at the window , wonderful views .",1
located close to the river seine this stunning construction is at its best at night when it is lit up .,1
very beautiful place .,1
the view from the second level is amazing .,1
well worth the 17 euro entry fee .,1
"things have changed since the november terrorist attacks -lrb- enhanced security , some fences have been put up -rrb- .",1
just visit it and enjoy !,1
i paid 3 times what the actual admission is with this `` tour '' that just included a tiny explanation on the second floor and the preferred entrance .,1
"definitely go all the way to the top , and make it extra special with champagne .",1
"if you have the time , experience this both during the day and after dark .",1
service was friendly and helpful .,1
no words can describe this .,1
we purchased our dinner package through viator and feel that it was certainly a great value when you consider the convenience it afforded us at this very popular and crowded attraction .,1
going to the summit is worth the wait - the views are incomparable .,1
"the eiffel tower is such a landmark and it was fantastic to finally be there ... however , i expect there are times that perhaps attract less people and i would recommend doing some research .",1
we did not have to wait around whats so ever we went straight up to the top .,1
the sheer experience of being there was awesome .,1
for the money this was fab !,1
"in the week we were in paris , we went twice to the eiffel tower , but we enjoyed both visits .",1
"i was also glad to visit the third , second and first levels -lrb- in that order -rrb- and then after the tour finished -lrb- about 2 hours -rrb- , have a glass of champagne on the first level , with my daughters as the sun set .",1
even crowded it was just a fantastic view and we 're thrilled we went there to at least get pictures and actually got in .,1
but finally made it to the top .,1
"we toured most of the city before going up , so it was fun to see the places we had been from the top .",1
she was very excited to get close to the tower .,1
"security is tight , the waiting lines , even with advance purchase reservation tickets -lrb- a must have -rrb- , are long .",1
"in the end , we did none of these things !!",1
very time taking if planning to go to the summit which is totally worth the wait and efforts .,1
"it 's also very beautiful to see lit up at night , especially when it sparkles for 5 minutes at the top of every hour .",1
"but it was because of the em in football , so its understandable .",1
the only good thing i can say it the views were magnificent and made it worth while .,1
booked the visit with fast access from gyg at choose 8:00 pm as entrance time .,1
your time is worth something .,1
"also , one lift is new and is faster ask the information about faster lift .",1
but also comes with a massive q if you wish to scale the eiffel tower .,1
this is the one item in paris that did not disappoint us at all .,1
great time and what a view !,1
"from the top of the eiffel tour , all the city can be visited and give a nice look in night time .",1
"great site to visit , did not disappoint .",1
very easy to get to via the metro and very reasonable in cost to visit .,1
"this was ideal as there was no queue or anything , straight in and up !",1
it was so magnificent and we were glad to have the opportunity to appreciate paris from this vantage point .,1
you need to hear about the engineer who figured out how he could build something so costly and fund it over the years .,1
it works a bit similar to a fastpass at disney in that the visitors with reservations get their own security line .,1
duh !,1
"i am also amazed at the amount of visitors they handled , politely , with humour and without any bureaucratic nonsense that could easily put a damper on any visit .",1
i took photos of it from as many angles as i could .,1
definitely a must see when in paris,1
"otherwise , it 's a remarkable attraction .",1
as you walk around paris you see this beautiful famous sight it 's breathtaking when you get up close .,1
beautiful to see such a preserved city .,1
be sure to keep your entrance tickets handy because they scan them as you exit one elevator -lrb- or lift as they call it -rrb- to the 2nd one .,1
i loved it !!!,1
the queues are huge so consider going early in the morning and search for quieter days .,1
"i mean , i knew it was going to be busy - we decided to go on valentine 's day so we knew what to expect .",1
"amazing view especially near to sunset , a lot photo shoot , then walkin in to half a cup of hot coffee .",1
i never missed the lighting of the tower for 3 nights .,1
"a way to shorten this is to but tickets for elevators from the second deck , as this allows you to take stairs up to the second platform and catch the elevator from there up to the top .",1
it blows your mind how big the eiffel tower is in person rather than what you would guess by looking at pictures .,1
we booked a skip the line ticket and tour on viator and it was the best way to see the eiffel tower .,1
you will not want to visit for another 20 years .,1
"what s place for a special lunch from entering the private entry , the marvellous lift ride and then the breath-taking view from your table .",1
definitely recommend thrill seekers or people who love heights pay a visit .,1
"nighttime is usually less crowded , and magical because it 's all lit up .",1
you can buy your ticket in advanc on the eiffel website it will give you a praiority in a privet short line .,1
it is one of the attractions that you must visit when you 're in paris .,1
all ...,1
when you are close you really see how big it is .,1
lines for entry via pre-purchased tickets was non-existent .,1
you ca n't miss it .,1
"travel all the way to the second floor by lift , did not go till top .",1
we booked them 90 days before on line via the eiffel tower website -lrb- sold out in 60 seconds at 7.30 am gmt -rrb- 90 days before we wanted to visit .,1
we went up to level 2 by elevator .,1
we ate lunch at the 58 eiffel .,1
the views are breathtaking - definitely worth the experience !,1
check out the views .,1
try to find a shop or stand - the price is a little more but they will state made in france in them .,1
wonderful monument to clime up and look out over the city .,1
the best way to go up the tower is to book with a tour .,1
they stand very very close to you so that you are so focused on them standing close to you that you do n't notice them stealing your wallet or phone .,1
from the 2nd floor you have to take another elevator anyway because the stairs end there .,1
being the main attraction expect queues and more queues .,1
tower is beautiful when they light it up .,1
also better to go early on in the day to avoid ridiculous queues .,1
the view from above is spectacular and definitely something everyone should experience .,1
"see it up close , see it at day , see it at night , see it from a far .",1
"while taking a sunset cruise on the river , we returned to dock just as the tower was lighting up !",1
"the tower is the most visited monument in the world , an average of 25,000 people every day .",1
recommend going up to the top first then stopping at the second level and first level on your way down .,1
we are going back for the night view .,1
"with the advance reservation you go through security with everyone else , then to a special line for people with tickets .",1
we had reservations for months in advance and i had reservations myself since the fixed menu was pretty different .,1
it is incredibly high up and the views of paris are unbelievable .,1
the lift takes u to the centre and from there you can climb stairs and enjoy the panaromic views of paris .,1
do n't miss to have lunch or dinner in the first floor restaurant .,1
i do n't think many people will go there again so do n't miss the summit .,1
"could n't access the first and higher floors at all , so disappointing !",1
best view is to get the metro to trocadero .,1
if you choose this option be prepared for a thigh burner .,1
"we went to the top during the following day which provided some wonderful views of paris , we thought 17 euros was quite reasonable to get to the top .",1
top attraction to view is the tour eiffel de paris .,1
security here is very strict with two different checkpoints to get through and can be very intimidating if you do not speak french .,1
"it is beautiful anytime of day to visit , but it 's especially wonderful at night .",1
they served champagne -lrb- of course at a cost -rrb- it was cold but nice to be all the way at the top .,1
we also bought the ticket to take us to the very top so we were in a special area and did not have to wait in line .,1
we returned one night around 10:30 to take pics of it lit up the night before we left and took metro to do this .,1
my dream to celebrate my birthday in front of eiffel tower came true this year .,1
sadly my photos do n't pick up on these .,1
beautiful tower but considering its the pride of france i felt it lacked the attention it deserves .,1
the architectures of the city 's landmarks where beautiful .,1
"view from second level is pretty much same as you would get from the summit , but again there is some thrill in going to the summit of eiffel .",1
you will never get tired of looking at it so see it in as many ways as you can,1
nah !,1
"the security check is a bit annoying , and that they do n`t have solution to store kids scooters -lrb- or buggies -rrb- .",1
you can stop at all floors on the way down .,1
you want to skip the line ... they were ridiculously long !!!!!!!!!!!,1
bring minimal bags to avoid the wait .,1
even has heating on the lower floors !,1
quite amazing just to stand underneath it and look up just to appreciate the sheer size of it .,1
be sure to get tickets ahead of time .,1
so what .,1
eiffel tower was a.dream to visit .,1
i last saw the eiffel tower in 2000 and visited it again on this trip to paris .,1
it is spectacular and especially at night when it is lit up and sparkles .,1
"when we first passed the eiffel tower while on the train , i was in complete awe .",1
"you go through security to get into the area around the tower , you go through more when you go in .",1
"grab some cups , a bottle of wine and blanket , and make an afternoon out of it !",1
get a dinner reservation so you do n't have to wait in a long line with the rest of the sightseers,1
big queues to get in and then again to buy a ticket and again to go up did not bother .,1
the ride up was easy and fast .,1
"considering the amount of people , the food selection is quite limited as well .",1
"crowded in summer , but the views are wonderful .",1
just sit on the garden and absorb this piece of engineering .,1
well worth the wait !!!!,1
"we did n't want to go up the eiffel tower as we had already done so on a pervious visit to paris , so we decided to go there around sunrise to look around and take a few pictures .",1
we loved it and it was worth every penny,1
we went and had lunch at the tower which was spectacular .,1
we chose to reserve tickets to `` skip the line '' tour with fat tire tours .,1
its going to be busy .,1
i was happier than a kid at christmas .,1
me and my wife got our first glimpse of the tower at 11 in the night and it was the most beautiful thing we had ever seen !,1
we stayed until they closed the place .,1
"wheelchair users can not ascend to the top , but we loved the things we did see .",1
"the tour guide was incredible friendly , engaging with the group members , and cared for the group to ensure we were having a good time .",1
"although we love paris and will be back , a one visit to the tower was enough .",1
i would do it all again and again ...,1
felt very safe and secure .,1
it can be seen during the day and also in the night for a spectacular view !,1
paris is a lot of things nice places to visit eat and drink but this must be at the top of any visit not much you can say about the tower expect where have not been to the top yet amazing,1
"so even if we didnt get to go up in the tower , it is still a beautiful view from the ground .",1
"though other lifts were not working , only one was operative , but we got very nice views from 3rd and 2nd levels too .",1
"at night , the illumination !!",1
they really do stick to your appointment time but relax in the champs mars before and join all other travellers in gazing up at this incredible sight .,1
"i would recommend to buy tickets online , it saves you time and queueing .",1
book a tour through fat tire tours and you can skip the first line plus get great history on the tower .,1
the ques are long .,1
we have visited eiffel tower through viator .,1
it 's wonderful and surely nobody would come to this wondeful city and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
fun .,1
one of its kind you must see paris by night when you a chance will never forget ... we came on cold weather but still great for a floridian its terribly cold at night :-rrb- .,1
"buy your passes online , that 's a good option as well .",1
"its not expensive to go to the top , which was open for our visit .",1
i always love to see the eiffel tower everytime in paris .,1
i recently took my partner to paris for her first trip to the capital and stayed a few streets away from the eiffel tower .,1
i am so glad i did .,1
2 of our group went to the second floor and myself went to the top amazing views from both levels,1
a nice sight of paris at night with the tower twinkling at night on the hour .,1
"we walked up to the second floor , which was a fun adventure for the family -lrb- two children 11 and 13 -rrb- and inexpensive for us !",1
"i did n't want to go , but my daughter did , so there you have it .",1
"do n't get me wrong , i went to the tower with so high expectations .",1
booked on line and i 'm glad we did as there was a two hour queue .,1
"while the view is n't the best in paris -lrb- especially since you ca n't see the iconic tour eiffel while * in * the tour eiffel -rrb- , it 's definitely an experience -- and taller than you think !",1
give it a go .,1
ca n't wait to go back !,1
"we have recently visited the eiffel tower and i would advise people to either book beforehand or walk up the stairs ... the queue was very slow , and did n't move much in half an hour ... but the walking queue was short ... good views from the top too so worth the walk !",1
perfect time to go is probably just before it gets dark .,1
seriously the eiffel tower s literally everything you 'd expect .,1
who do n't talk no for an answer .,1
it is just wonderful .,1
we returned that night to our room and then in the morning caught a subway back but unfortunately it was a hazy morning and it would have been uneventful to take the elevator to the top - unless of course you wanted to look at clouds .,1
still queued for an hour even though i went at night .,1
"for the best experience , alight from trocadéro metro , 1 hours before sunset .",1
as good a day out as you can have .,1
"lucky to go to paris in november 2011 when the weather is good , and no crowds .",1
the view is stunning as is the structure .,1
"walking around the perimeter rail you will see notre dame , versialles and every landmark lit up .",1
still a lot of people around .,1
we did not climb the top most level but that must be breathtaking .,1
it was fun to visit,1
"expect lines even in off season , but well worth it .",1
"if in paris , it is a must .",1
"still , there were tons of people .",1
we purchased tickets to the very top although the wee one was n't too keen initially .,1
the lines for tickets looked longer than it really was .,1
you are in paris so it is a must do .,1
i recommend finding your favorite .,1
such an amazing and magical structure .,1
fantastic views from both levels and a gift shop up there also .,1
"the eiffel tower is one of the most recognizable structures on the planet , it welcomes more visitors than any other paid monument in the world an estimated 7 million people per year .",1
another must see for visitors to paris .,1
"loved the view at night , it was beautifully lit , we walked the stairs down from the 2nd tier , it was longer than we thought , but we would do it again !",1
it was n't just the tower that got me .,1
"been here serveral times never gets bored , amazing view no word needed to explain why you need to go here",1
dinner and waiters were very good .,1
a couple of signs would be sufficient .,1
but line up and ascend the tower on your first trip to paris and you wo n't need to repeat the experience .,1
"i always would suggest , take the stairs .",1
"it is worth it to book tickets ahead of time so you can skip the line , but you must go to the top , it is the best view in paris .",1
"we went to paris for a day trip , and as we wanted to cram as much in as possible we chose to take the stairs .",1
there are beverages for purchase on the 2nd floor also .,1
one reason is that it give a queue-jumping solution to the tourist mobs of the summer .,1
especially going down .,1
"we later revisited at around 7pm , so we could go to the top .",1
i went twice this time .,1
1st is enough .,1
i ca n't wait to come back and see it again already !!!!!,1
had champagne at the top from the bar and the bar man took a lovely photo of us .,1
"it is not cheap and there are thousands of tourists , but still it is worth while .",1
"lines to purchase tickets , lines for security , lines for the lifts .",1
this is the most busiest atttaction in paris and there are some nice restaurants on it and the views were spectacular and this is the top must do in paris,1
great fun to watch from the second floor .,1
the tower is one of the most iconic structures in the world .,1
"i do n't know if i 'd do it again , but i am glad i did it once .",1
i 'm sure it 's security reasons but just something to keep in mind .,1
great experience view incredable structure pleasant service food and eine was fine we booked in a group andvit felt rushed,1
"also , please be aware that there are no toilets to be found at ground level .",1
this is something that you must see with your own eyes .,1
this could be viewed as a little pricey at 13 $ + a glass but nice champagne .,1
"the eiffel tower visit was great , but the only problem were with directions in the tower i did n't know were to go -lrb- my fist time -rrb- and difficult to find the elevator .",1
pack light .,1
hope to come back to paris soon .,1
each time i learn something else on grande dame de fer !,1
we visited on saturday morning and the crowds were low .,1
very reasonable price-wise -lrb- euros 17 per adult to the summit including the lift -rrb- .,1
"if you are wanting lunch , you can eat at the le jules verne or the 58 tour eiffel , these are restaurants inside of the tower but can be extremely expensive .",1
it is open until late which helps you to avoid big queues during the day and the view is always great .,1
pricey but worth it !,1
"it was also very beautiful at night , when the lights were shone upon the towel !!",1
my favorite place is to stand in the middle of the square between the four towers and look up .,1
we enjoyed a long week-end in paris and as a matter of course we paid a visit to this magnificent `` old lady '' .,1
day ir night is a landmark !,1
what a huge treat for my bucket list !,1
if you 're in paris you have to go through .,1
"it was a nice afternoon , so the sky is clear and i can see paris , the lovely city is in right there .",1
my husband and i went up at dusk so we were lucky enough to see paris in daylight and darkness .,1
there is evidence of new hurriedly security measure here with hastily erected fencing .,1
book online for a specific time slot and the adhoc ticket queue was long .,1
a great way to spend a few hours .,1
and you will avoid long lines to take the elevator up to the top .,1
"the best thing about eiffel is that it 'll play peekaboo with you all around paris and and every time you catch a glimpse of it you will be excited , even if that 's the 100th time .",1
"there 's also a restaurant , a cafeteria and a gift shop .",1
you can buy lift to the varying levels which has a pretty long line or you can walk to the first or even second observation deck and by your lift tickets from there on up to the top and shorten your wait as well as enjoy the views on the stairs .,1
"every one knows it s a must do trip , go early not to have long queu , have some water with you .",1
this time we visited at night and had dinner at the jules verne restaurant on the 2nd level .,1
our kids wanted to go up the stairs to the second level and so we did .,1
well nothing new to be said for eiffel tower .,1
i found the summit and second level of the attraction to be very crowded .,1
"well worth the visit , especially on a good day , there 's probably nothing else to match the views of a picturesque city , but the queues !",1
"we thought about booking in advance , but reviews on tripadvisor suggested september would not be a busy period and so it turned out .",1
fantastic adventure,1
what a great experience !,1
i made sure i have a picture of it both day and night .,1
"i have been there twice , and never went up the tower .",1
visiting the eiffel tower was all i had hoped for and more .,1
it was far larger than i had expected and although i had intended to go all the way to the top : i only made it to the middle section !,1
"we had a quick walk around the top taking as many pics as we could on got back in the queue to go down - we were in the queue for 50 minutes with only two lifts operational , when we got out joined the queue to go back down which was a further 45 minutes by the time we got back down we had a massive task to get back to the eurostar in time which we did with minutes to spare .",1
there 's a snack bar on level 2 but it 's cheaper to take a bottle of water .,1
"we had no clue where the gustave statue was , and that we had to go through the reservations line to enter the eiffel tower area to locate it , as did most our group .",1
the best views are from the trocadero/palais de chaillot and champs de mars park areas .,1
a wonderful pleasant walk !,1
staff were rude .,1
excellent views and good bathrooms .,1
the tour of the tower is must if you wish to get the experience of it .,1
we enjoyed our brief experience there .,1
the views were beautiful .,1
truly magnificent tower .,1
"and then the wait to take the elevator to the first stop , and then the elevator to the top .",1
do yourself a favor and book tickets in advance using the eiffel tower 's easy to use web site .,1
probably one of the most photographed structure in the world not to be out done by the golden gate bridge in san francisco california .,1
they try push you to give donation .,1
you do get amazing views up here .,1
"the view from the top is just fantastic - and while the champagne is very expensive , having a glass at what feels like the top of the world is very much a memorable experience .",1
"we booked tikets online , which turned out to be a great thing , special line for security and then direct access to the elevator .",1
waited so long to get up the tower a bird had time to poo on my head .,1
walking underneath the tower is impressive .,1
this is paris .,1
it was our first trip to paris and watching the sunset with friends there was the best !,1
walked down from the second level which added to the experience .,1
best seen from the adjacent park on a clear day .,1
a must see but do n't think you 'll see it all in one day .,1
vist is not enough you must go to second & third level also .,1
there are no words to describe .,1
"in paris four days , july 2015 , visited eiffel tower no less than four times and had dinner at the restaurant - all a truly wonderful experience .",1
"the timed entry was really easy , we went to the north entry at the prescribed time and walked right in , even getting on the elevator was easy as well as the change to the summit elevator was only a short 2 min wait .",1
i am not going to gush forth with superlative after superlative .,1
"although this was our second time there , it never gets old .",1
we climbed up and had lunch in the inside of the tower to celebrate my partner 's birthday .,1
last week was my first time in paris .,1
easier on weekdays to go .,1
"there is a long queue for tickets and visiting the top , so it 's best to come on weekdays .",1
lunchtime is the busiest apparently so try to avoid that,1
although the lines can be long you do n't really wait that long .,1
i thought i would n't be impressed as its such a well known structure but i was totally blown away .,1
still amazing after over 120 years .,1
the view of paris from top is very nice .,1
they do n't check whether you have a stairs ticket for the lift back down from the second floor so if you 're exhausted grab the lift instead of climbing,1
when we visited you could only get to the second floor .,1
t 's the most beautiful thing i 've seen .,1
was super cold and romantic .,1
always breath taken !!!,1
but its just something you go and see and leave .,1
the eiffel tower is an exceptional -lrb- and romantic -rrb- way to see paris from the sky .,1
i visited for lunch on a windy and rainy day .,1
definitely a family site to visit and experience .,1
you will be asked many times if you speak english - do not answer and walk straight ahead .,1
"blessed my world , nearly to tears , when they turned on the light show around 8 .",1
we were there at christmas time and enjoyed many food vendors as well as ice skating .,1
it took an hour to queue for the ticket desk and then had to queue for about 30 mins to get to the lift that takes you up to the tower so there is a lot of time spent in a queue so i would recommend booking the tower before you go to paris so you can skip the queue .,1
lines were short and the views were spectacular !,1
you definitely have to take the tour to go at least to the second floor for stunning views of the city and do this at sunset .,1
especially as it turned dusk and the lights came on !,1
either go early in the morning when lines are n't too bad or potentially buy tickets online as from about midday onwards the queue just goes on and on .,1
had tried to make a booking on line but got the dates wrong .,1
this should be number 1 on your paris sightseeing list .,1
hope to see it some day .,1
make sure you hold on to yours camaras/phones when taking photos !,1
book the tickets for going up in advance as they get sold out weeks before .,1
"had a great 2 days in paris meeting my sister from manila , philippines .",1
we were n't interested in climbing or taking an elevator to the top .,1
"before we left , we caught the batobus for a night time cruise and got great shots of the tower lit up .",1
indeed a city for lovers.romantic walk or just leisurely walking looking at the eiffel tower or just sitting on the bench with your love ones .,1
"we had a tour so could go in the shorter lines -lrb- even in off-season , the lines to go up in the tower were long -rrb- .",1
my 7 year old was well able for it .,1
however i do n't really see the big deal about it .,1
this is late september .,1
a trip to paris is not complete without a visit here .,1
the lights all over the structure are amazing to watch before heading up to the top .,1
you shod book your tickets ahead of time because there may not be any when you arrive .,1
"long line , but the view was amazing .",1
but at $ 7 euros it is a bargain and is a must for all who visit !,1
"our tour included access to the summit , but we passed on this as the view of paris from the second level was outstanding , and we did n't want to wait 15 minutes for the elevator to take us up higher .",1
this is the heart of paris and one of the places you must go .,1
only way to gain entrance and escorted to the gate .,1
horrible crowds in august and the pickpockets were out in force .,1
we found ourselves wandering around the city and ending up at the eiffel tower quite regularly during our stay .,1
a friendly community police presence would at least limit the damn hawkers and beggars .,1
make sure to take the elevator all the way to the top !,1
booked a skip-the-line ticket with fat tire .,1
join a tour so you bypass the huge line ups .,1
we opted not to stand in line for lift tickets and took the stairs instead .,1
the sight of eiffel tower at night with lighting in the tower is an unforgettable experience .,1
"it was crowded , chilling cold and still one of the most exhilarating experience during our trip .",1
the champ de mars park was also full of people which could have resulted to some areas becoming barren of grass and muddy .,1
stay and have a coffee on the first floor after climbing to the top .,1
fab views,1
worth the long cue you have to wait in .,1
i pre booked tickets to go up the eiffel tower prior to my trip and thank god as the queue was massive .,1
one of the best places in the world .,1
we did get a few nice souvenir keyrings though : - -rrb-,1
"i went early at 8:30 am to wait on line , so my 4 yr old son can sleep in .",1
"i understand that time slots sell out for certain hours of the day , and especially in summer .",1
there are gardens and trees around it and we got some pretty amazing pictures .,1
went up at sunset to see the city in day light and night time .,1
get there early to avoid big line ups and crowds .,1
"the tour lasted about an hour and the tour guide , leticia , did a terrific job !",1
we did n't go up -lrb- ques to long -rrb- but if in paris it seems rude not to at least visit it .,1
you 'll get to see a glimpse of this from any part of the zone 1-3 in paris .,1
a person can not visit paris without checking out the eiffel tower .,1
you must pass through metal detectors to enter .,1
so ... wear good shoes and be prepared to work hard if you 're climbing up,1
it is worth to wait in line for a ticket into believe tickets are available each day .,1
the tower is beautiful and everyone was so friendly and welcoming unlike what many have said about paris !,1
the queue to get to the very top was a couple of hours long -lrb- bearing in mind i was i paris around peak tourist time - bastille day -rrb- so i did n't go up .,1
"i 've visited eiffel tower many times , as i live in paris and every time my friends coming here thay ask me to go there .",1
be warned you will have to go through 2 security checks including having your bags xray 'd .,1
"breathtaking views across the city , is the only way i can describe it .",1
the most famous landmark in the center of the world .,1
amazing at night .,1
"going up to the top is well worth it , especially that you 've come all the way from another planet .",1
the whole city was visible and night looks very handsome .,1
scantily clad dancers !,1
"however , i am reviewing the tower and surroundings here .",1
lots of places to kiss ;-rrb- go ... a must see !,1
the best place to see the tower is from across the river .,1
it 's paris so you 're going to the eiffel tower .,1
you can now buy over priced champagne in paper cups .,1
"i understand they have to do it and i felt safe for it , but it was very sad because i remember how it was before .",1
just go in early as possible to avoid long lines !!,1
always lots of people and long queues .,1
you can see the tower from the base for free .,1
"some people opt to take the stairs , from the first to the second level , but did n't .",1
"i 'd recommended going up at night , but arrive about an hour before dark and take pics in the evening light before going up when it 's dark .",1
there is a lot of security .,1
"you meet you host at the meeting point next to tower , you will listern to a historic presentation of the tower .",1
que was long and the top half was closed when we visited .,1
the extra trip to the summit is worth while .,1
long queues and security checks .,1
luckily i ended up in the right end of the line to get tickets to go the rest of the way up .,1
we came in mid-july .,1
seen a beautiful view of paris from the tower .,1
a must do attraction in paris .,1
"i would strongly recommend a trip to the top ; a trip to the actual peak -lrb- which costs a little extra -rrb- is not worth it in my opinion , and be prepared to spend a lot if you 'd like to take home a souvenir .",1
"even if you do n't go up in the tower , viewing it from the ground and the park of champs de mars is still amazing .",1
"it 's a difficult attraction to get into , with long queues , so if you can , book ahead on the website .",1
"2 different experiences , both are worth it .",1
looks so much prettier at night time when it 's all lit up .,1
"a dream come true since i came to paris all i wanted to see was the eiffel tower , either walk around , eat at a fine restaurant overlooking the tower , enjoy a crepes on the carousel made this trip an experience that i will never forget .",1
magnificent none the less .,1
we stayed at an air bnb place a block away from the majestic eiffel tower .,1
there are queues to take the last lift to the top .,1
and its awesome to view right under the tower and from trocadero plaza .,1
i just visited the eiffel tower for a second time with my wife .,1
saw long lines to go in the elevator and then saw the stairs line was very short .,1
you can take an elevator up .,1
i would have regretted not seeing the eiffel tower but be prepared for the little nuances that put a damper on seeing the tower itself .,1
screaming teenagers took away from the relaxed viewing .,1
from top platform paris look like jewel,1
"also , went across the street and had the most amazing crepe in one of the stands .",1
buy your tickets in advance and experience the views !,1
we took the elevator all the way up to the top of eiffel tower .,1
"we booked through a skip the line tour , unfortunately did not have a great experience and almost missed this very expensive tour , could n't remember which agency that has poor communication , just make sure you check the meeting point way ahead before your tour .",1
i was surprised !,1
did not venture any higher as heights are n't our thing .,1
as he sun goes down the lights come up and so do the street hawkers ... none were obtrusive .,1
"i did n't take the elevator to the top , so maybe that would have made a difference .",1
just be careful of pick picketers in the tourist areas .,1
make your reservations in advance and get breath taking views of the city .,1
this is an experience not to be missed .,1
"it 's good to see the tower from several different perspectives , away from the crowd .",1
just a caution about one 's belongings .,1
"if you like seeing cityscapes from up high , you should definitely go straight up to the summit as well as it 's a beautiful view of lovely paris .",1
"i failed to get tickets online , and the line to buy tickets to the top was unreal and not moving .",1
i could spend all day with it as my view and not get sick of it .,1
mild weather and the rain staying away helped .,1
"the public areas were clean , the first floor eatery and toilets immaculate .",1
we booked out time slot and got there and went straight up !,1
i could n't believe how huge this is .,1
i went to paris thrice but i went up once only .,1
the metro du trocadero is about 2 - 3 min away so easy to get to .,1
we visited in february and had a very short wait to go up .,1
highlight of our trip going to the top .,1
also waiting in line to get a ticket you can catch a chill if not attired warmly .,1
the eiffel tower was brilliant and the views spectacular .,1
the views of paris of course does not need a mentioned.visit to paris would n't be complete without visit to the tower .,1
"easily reachable on the metro and next to the river , it is essentially the center of paris .",1
it was brilliant !,1
pay and go up to the top - its so worth it and the views are spectacular .,1
beautiful and romantic .,1
we did n't have advance tickets so we ended up in the queue .,1
definitely worth the wait !,1
no wonder why .,1
"beautiful , fairly cold , so suggest to get dressed up to keep warm .",1
you stay too long to get on tower .,1
this worked extremely well as we entered the tower via the group tours line which speeds up entry considerably .,1
it was really nice to see the design and felt good standing at the top and having an aerial view of paris .,1
"visited it for the second time , it 's interesting but more interesting to look at from a distance than up close .",1
"it is so beautiful , and is a real icon of the city .",1
interesting to view gustav eiffels apartment at the summit - the very thing that eventually resulted in this structure remaining and not being dismantled at the end of its contractual life after the world fair .,1
it 's the ultimate affordable paris experience !,1
this is the earliest they are released via the cheaper online eiffel tower official website .,1
"so we 've all heard about the eiffel tower , how ` romantic ' , majestic , it is and all .",1
we were very surprised at just how amazing the eiffel tower is .,1
the sparkling lights that go off every hour after dark are certainly worth seeing .,1
you can not go to paris without climbing the tower .,1
"got to the top at sunset , and it was crowded , but just gorgeous .",1
this place is must-visit !,1
who could not like the eiffel tower ?,1
"the front of the line got us a short walking tour leading up to the tower then absolutely no wait to get in the elevator to the second level , where the tour continued for about another 30 minutes .",1
at night - best place to see the light show .,1
had an amazing time at the eiffel tower !,1
the eiffel tower is very well maintained and a good place to take photos with your friends .,1
"but it was a lot of fun taking photos in the tower , under the tower , outside the tower -lrb- while walking along the seine river -rrb- .",1
"if you want a view , go have dinner at le ciel and see the eiffel light show , paris , and sunset .",1
"must visit , view from top is awesome , one can go on top by lift , charges are applicable , beware of pick pocket .",1
it is not a cheap sight seers quick meal .,1
"we had checked earlier in the week for the online bookings , but it said that it was sold out , but we went on a drizzly day and it must have kept a lot of people away .",1
visited with family of five and we were in awe of the size and beauty .,1
going here knew it would be touristy but the line to go up top was too long so we decided to just walk around and admire .,1
we felt really nice to have a look around the city from the top .,1
views are great from there .,1
"yes paris has much more but if you metion paris , folk will always ask if you went up the tower .",1
what an amazing experience !!,1
we did n't expect much but were happily surprised because the food was terrific .,1
"the lift is a little scary though , my partner struggled with the height as it made her dizzy and light headed .",1
"if you have a ticket to the summit , you get onto a second elevator to go up .",1
you cant visit paris without visiting the eiffel tower,1
super cheap and beautiful .,1
the views are amazing and i picked the right day !,1
it was so worth it !,1
we had lunch at one of the restaurants so we gain entry to the tower without paying for entrance fee .,1
my boyfriend and i visited paris this week for 4 nights and booked our tickets to visit the eiffel tower online .,1
lunch on the first level looked fun .,1
good to climb to the top and view the city below .,1
we tried to find the ticket office on the second floor from where you can buy tickets to the top floor but we could n't find it even though we tried hard ;p the line to the top floor is again long so expect some waiting time if you are planning to go ... there are souvenir shops and toilets on the 2nd floor as well as a macaroon stall .,1
"on a clear day , this is the thing you have to do in paris .",1
"definitely go at night if you have to choose between day and night so that you can see it lit up and at the top of every hour , it will sparkle for 5 minutes .",1
even walking up to the second level is worth it .,1
i am not sure why they only operated only one that day we were there .,1
bring champagne and cups because they guys walking selling drinks around will pester you if they see you empty handed and will try to sell you overpriced champagne and beer .,1
it 's administration was very well organised and we hired a guide who was very helpful and knowledgeable .,1
"a ride to the top is a must , especially to try and grab a sunset view from the highest point in paris .",1
after admiring the view you can walk directly to eiffel from here .,1
it 's especially special when it 's lit up and flashing at night .,1
i have never been quite as speechless as i was being under the eiffel tower .,1
"beautiful dancers , dazzling costumes and performances !",1
does n't really give you an accurate feel of paris .,1
to be honest this is the reason why most people visit paris .,1
"stay away from the shops as most items were cheaper to buy elsewhere , and were the same .",1
you can pay to go up the tower as well and get pretty stunning views up there !,1
enjoy sipping on champagne while enjoying the views with your loved ones .,1
"people brought their kids strollers , we left ours at the hotel , it was tight and crowded .",1
you will then be re-screened a second time so be prepared for an added half hour wait before gaining access to the tower .,1
got to second level about 1030am .,1
"as with all towers , try to be there around sunset to get a feel of all day time views .",1
"`` mother nature , on short trips she ca n't be trusted ! ''",1
buy a skip the line ticket .,1
food and souveniers are horrible pricy .,1
the view from the top was breathtaking .,1
"we booked a nighttime tour with skip the line with viator and it was really great.you have to meet later at night outside a certain metro station which is quite easy to get there and one you get there it is a really busy tourist area with great views of the eiffel tower.we took some pictures before our tour station so we could take our time which is a good thing because when the tour started people were only given a few minutes to get some and because it 's really busy on the top it 's best to do it before so you can take your time.you get given a headset and you have a guide taking you round and telling you all about how and why the tower was built and a lot of other facts about the tower which i never knew about.the guide tells you all about the tower while you are walking and making your way down to the tower.once you get to the tower you show your pass to skip the que then you put your bags though a machine and walk though a metal detector then you make your way to the lift to go to the second floor , while on the second floor you can take lots of photo 's and then you can pay a little extra and to right to the top which we did and it 's well worth doing because the views are fantastic , there are a couple of little shops selling souvenirs , you can then go down to the 1st floor where the restaurant is but if you want to go in you have to book before.when you come out of the tower you will see lots of shops selling souvenirs and the river seine where the boats are.i paid # 71.04 for 2 adults to do the nighttime tour with skip the line but they do quite a few different types if you want something different .",1
there are so many people there but you knew that right .,1
how do you even begin to rate an iconic monument ?,1
the panorama view of the city from the tower is truly impressive and makes for some amazing pictures .,1
"we all had an amazing visit , but do book ahead , it was great to fast track the lengthy queue with prebooked tickets especially in the heat of the summer .",1
a must see even if you are petrified of heights like i am .,1
lovely people who work there you can go to 3 levels or take the plunge get to the top .,1
incredible structure and demands attention .,1
"though an absolute engineering marvel , the eiffel is too overrated in terms of the visit to this monument .",1
any mist will burn off by midday to reveal france in all its glory .,1
"ok people there is more then one way in the tower , if you do some research you can skip the long long long line .",1
"as i did not open the talk to them and there they start to yelled at me , was a bit upset but again to re-think that they are doing it to survive but still can not figure out why they would come to other country with no special skill to earn money from .",1
it 's a fun and not too difficult walk with great views .,1
qued for ages ... the view was beautiful but it 's nicer at the bottom,1
despite the crowds we really enjoyed our trip to the top .,1
definitely pay to go all the way to the top .,1
everyone should do this once in their lifetime .,1
breathtaking engineering achievement .,1
"i 've visited it numerous times , but my first summed up the experience .",1
"much has changed since my first visit and of course , the view is fantastic .",1
"at night , take a sit on the grass at the garden and marvel the light show no other tourist spot in the world could offer .",1
"we visited iconic of paris in the beautiful morning , then we came back at night as a guide advice .",1
"there were two large groups -lrb- over 20 people -rrb- that cut several of us smaller groups in this line , which resulted in people arguing , it was not pleasant .",1
the buss stop in about 300 meters from the tower .,1
"you could see it from everywhere in paris , we catch this beauty from each place we have visited , the only problem is security line was too long",1
wear comfortable walking shoes and give yourself plenty of time to see everything in and around the entire eiffel tower area .,1
you must go up at least once ... unless deathly afraid of heights .,1
i expected it to be ugly but found it quite interesting .,1
well worth paying to go to the top and not just half way .,1
"weather is best in late march , early may .",1
i strongly suggest going up inside the tower .,1
the concierge at our hotel assisted us in booking a 2130 tour of the eiffel tower for 15 june .,1
the staff are helpful .,1
will visit again .,1
lights up and twinkles at night .,1
huge iconic for birds eye view of paris - book online for the top floors - during evenings close sunset .,1
i went up ... .,1
"i also had no idea how the eiffel tower came about but it was the winning design for a contest to construct a structure with certain dimensions and the winner of course , was mr. eiffel !",1
"you have to pay atenccion where you are buying the ticket , some box office have only the ticket for elevator , and go by foot is cheaper than by elevator .",1
we saw some activity going on in the distance and went to join in after .,1
you can spend as much time as you like and can stop at other levels on the way down .,1
we visited in april when the elevators start working at 9:30 am .,1
it is iconic and the symbol of this city .,1
the views from the top are breathtaking .,1
i visited 20 years ago but did n't do the climb to the top .,1
we went to a lunch in the eifel tower and it was great .,1
lack of facilities & lack of staff to answer questions .,1
it really is an amazing experience and the eiffel tower is bigger and more beautiful than i expected .,1
be sure to go to the very top .,1
we had better pictures from the opposite side at the champs de mars where the sun was behind us .,1
i think it may have even been faster than the elevator which had an incredibly long line .,1
the views are stunning and if you are in paris at christmas time .,1
"beautiful panorama of paris , a piece of history under your feet .",1
ca n't really share anything new or exciting here that others have n't already commented on .,1
views are amazing from 2nd floor and the summit .,1
your visit to paris is incomplete if you do not visit eiffel tower .,1
you will love it ...,1
food was excellent .,1
i 've been up in the height of summer and the middle of winter .,1
we went in february knowing the weather would not be ideal .,1
the souvenir shops on the 1st & 2nd floor are reasonable and best .,1
when we finally got there -lrb- and the closer we got and the bigger it got -rrb- i was won over .,1
we had no idea there was ice skating on the tower .,1
we have both been to the eiffel tower before but this was the first time we had gone together for a romantic long weekend in paris .,1
p.s. it is not just two flights of stairs,1
however i am on a business flight layover in paris and thought we 'd take another look .,1
we did not go up the eiffel tower .,1
stand the bridge or in the bridge and marvel at this beauty .,1
visited restaurant 58 tour eiffel for ` picnic ' lunch .,1
"i did not go up though , as i did not prebook .",1
restaurant and shopping on 2nd level .,1
"all levels were busy but not overcrowded , the top level was tight but everyone was courteous & made room to take photo 's .",1
windy and cold on the top so dress appropriately !,1
the twinkly lights switch on every hour on the hour and so going up at 8 and down at 9 made it even more special .,1
an amazing structure,1
"missed this last time in paris , but this is a venue that should not be missed .",1
"also , once we were on this platform they opened up the very top one and you could pay the extra tariff to continue upwards but , as i mentioned , we did n't feel the need to because the views were excellent .",1
we took a tour and frankly only so we could get in because the tickets were `` sold out '' online and we did did not want to miss it .,1
do n't wait in line for the elevator to the top .,1
thankfully we read a blog before the trip and managed to avoid getting caught in a few scams .,1
fall in love with this amazing landmark with first sight .,1
"when you are standing beneath it , you feel its massiveness , yet you are charmed by its beauty at the same time .",1
we visited the eiffel tower primarily because my daughter -lrb- 8 -rrb- was obsessed with the idea of not only seeing it but going up .,1
but even at 10 pm there were crowds of people lined up .,1
would recommend having this experience .,1
check out the restaurant au petit sud ouest that is near bye,1
the cruise to see the eiffel tower is the highlight of the trip .,1
the eiffel tower entrance ticket is quite expensive if you want to visit the very top .,1
we had an amazing experience to see the sunset from top .,1
but we did n't mind ... there 's always next time : -rrb-,1
so 13.50 for a great experience in paris .,1
there are too many black people selling souvenir .,1
we did n't go to the top as there were big queues but i do n't feel that we missed out as we wandered about the gardens underneath .,1
obviously if you go to paris you must go to the eiffel tower .,1
you can not miss those amazing views which will take your breath away .,1
4 stars because the queues are ridiculously long .,1
my family absolutely loved the eiffel tower on our visit to paris .,1
i would recommend going early to avoid que .,1
the whole experience was fantastic however we stood in really long cues to get to the top of the eiffel .,1
"the only perhaps of this attraction may have been too many people crowding the vicinity -lrb- summer vacations probably -rrb- and i felt a little uncomfortable with a sense of insecurity , caused by many people selling things on the streets and everyone telling us to take care because of pickpocket near the tower .",1
"magnificent view , amazing piece of architecture and a landmark .",1
enjoy a glass of champagne at the top and take a photo !,1
come on people !,1
"we popped in around 2200 , and the tower was beautifully lit .",1
eiffel tower is a must see up close .,1
it is an iconic tower in paris and the most romantic spot .,1
we saw the eiffel tower almost every day on our walking adventures and museum visits throughout the week .,1
"there are many attractions to see when you 're in paris , but this is one you just have to do .",1
i went in september and it was quite busy at that time.weather was wonderful .,1
be prepared for throngs of tourists though .,1
had a very great time with family .,1
just stay close to the tower where there is security .,1
be sure to bring cash as their interac machines are known to go down .,1
"love the eiffel tower , a must see when going to paris .",1
"if i had to pick my favorite thing in paris , it would be the eiffel tower .",1
found there wasnt staff on hand to ask questions so you just had to muddle through .,1
the cue was too long for security check and then for tickets so i skipped it since it 's not my first time,1
must get your ticket in advance otherwise you have to wait for a looong line .,1
once it was her kings and queens .,1
"but this majestic lady has stood for over a century , survived many conflicts and will now than likely be standing for our great grandchildren to come .",1
"there are many iconic sites to see that are just perfect for families , couples , or even by yourself to see .",1
"no need to climb the tour , beautiful views when you walk along the seine .",1
"we spent the afternoon at the eiffel tower , had lunch at a café around the corner and picked up some souvenirs .",1
i think we waited in line over 3 hours to buy tickets !,1
"it pretty much kill the whole day , and there are much more interesting places to see and visit .",1
"on new years we were walking back to our hotel at 1 am and it did its sparkle , then did a different sparkle - all silver instead of the gold you usually see - and turned off for the night .",1
"it 's iconic , it 's a little scary , it 's breathtaking .",1
"it was so beautiful and lovely , its a nice place to see and have a romantic time with your partner , nice environment.will visit again to this place",1
this is the symbol of france !,1
i am very afraid of heights but felt very safe and secure when walking up the steps .,1
great place for kids who love going up and down the stairs and seeing the view and they do n't have to stare at paintings !,1
a lot of steel in that tower .,1
"and it was worth it , beautiful paris from the sky !",1
"it was a short walk to the pullman hotel and the street was very well lit , w/a few other people around .",1
"anyway , it 's even better close-up , surrounded by lovely gardens .",1
"to save wait time , book ahead for access to tower though bookings need to be made weeks in advance .",1
"try a nearby bar or cafe , order up whatever suits you and just take in the grandeur .",1
go in evening time after 7:30 pm,1
i have visited the eiffel tower both in the summer and winter during the day and at night .,1
so iv been in paris the last couple of days and you just can not go visit this beautiful tower !,1
first time on this attraction and it lived up to its reputation .,1
i visited it today again after few months and i found it fenced all round with security access gate like the football stadiums .,1
wonderful day out plenty to see and do and reasonable prices to go up the tower .,1
a visit to the eiffel tower is a must when visiting this busy city .,1
however the amount of time spent waiting in lines made it not worth the price of admission .,1
security was tight .,1
views were incredible !,1
"a must visit when in paris the eiffel tower in the evening , all lit up its magical !",1
it is the best scenery i have ever witnessed .,1
no proper queuing system with people pushing in and attendants altering the queuing system - this was frustrating .,1
a moment to remember,1
this attractions is extremely busy and results in long lines -lrb- four hrs .,1
"we had , months before , booked a behind the scenes tour of the tower thru the et official web site , but we found out just a couple of days before that the tour was canceled and our money refunded -lrb- because of a strike -rrb- .",1
definitely worth it .,1
"we came in the morning and since the line was n't too bad , we decided to go up and check out the view .",1
"luckily there is a lot of shade under the tower while waiting in line , but there are parts of the queue that you will be in the sun , so be ready .",1
"to get near the eiffel tower , they searched bags and patted you down .",1
"so many people came out , and what a party !",1
it was as breath taking as expected .,1
not much more can be said of one of the greatest structures in the world .,1
buy in advance to go to the top .,1
"of course , one of the highlights of taking a trip to paris is seeing the effiel tower .",1
usually very crowded .,1
very dissappointed,1
this was my second visit and i had my mom with me who had never been .,1
"it was a magical moment when the skies dimmed , the city and tower lights comes on .",1
"it is iconic , it is always present in the sky , and it is now heavily guarded ... do not miss .",1
sadly although mon petit paris says they will get back to you asap they have yet to respond to my two emails .,1
it is just wonderful in person .,1
we were in paris june 2016 during the big football match and some other things that were going on so i expected to wait a long time to go up to the top of the eiffel tower - not so .,1
some who are there with us for the third or fourth time shared the same felling .,1
if you are n't afraid of small elevators packed with people - go to the top floor to see some amazing views !,1
a bit nerve-wracking but makes for great photos and a bit of scary fun -lrb- even if just for a few seconds -rrb- !,1
all around the tower are hawkers trying to sell their little trinkets for 1-5 euros and you 'll hear the same pitch over and over again which was exhausting and obnoxious .,1
"amazing views , it was lovely .",1
"if you go to paris , you have to see the eiffel tower , and we sure did , walking the nearly 5 miles round trip from our hotel three times .",1
we decided to wait till it was dark and we were so glad we did .,1
another thing marked off my bucket list : -rrb-,1
everyone i came in contact with was fantastic .,1
the sunset views from the first deck were gorgeous .,1
"a truelly majestic structure , and loved being able to see it up close - as it is beautiful .",1
even in the quiet season the queues are very long .,1
champagne is cheaper to buy on the lower floors than the top floor as well .,1
great photo opportunities .,1
my choice would be seeing the eiffel tower lit at night .,1
having said that years on and we have this palace and it 's grounds left for the generations to visit .,1
if you want to go to the top i would get the tickets before to avoid the queue .,1
it is such a signature for paris .,1
there are a lot of binoculars up and the view is amazing !,1
we went up the stairs the first two levels -- taking the elevator on level 2 to the summit -- and started our journey just before 5:00 pm .,1
"you 've got to get at least one trinket , just to say you did , but wait until before you are about to head down , or you 'll be carting it around while you 're trying to get your pictures taken .",1
bring a jacket and layer clothes because it colder at the top then at the bottom during the colder months .,1
we did saved a lot of time by skipping the queue for the ticket office and we went straight to take the going up elevator .,1
it is not as much fun to wait in line to get a chance to go up in the elevator but it is definitely amazing to see it from up close - at night and during the day .,1
"the tower was amazing , and a once in a lifetime opportunity .",1
"this is our third visit to paris , when we arrive we do n't actually feel like we are here until we first sight the grand lady , during this visit we picked up a ham & cheese baguette , a quiche and a coffee and sat as the parisians do in the shadow of the tower for our picnic lunch and watched the world go by , to think she was meant to be a temporary installation , we could not imagine paris without the tower .",1
i was happy with the history and different interactive boards shown on the 1st floor .,1
"there were long queues at each entrance when we were there , and no-one really knew what was going on : most service people did not speak english , you left the queue , you lost your place , by the time you got to one entry , they closed it - so it is pretty chaotic , you had better plan your visit carefully and get as much info as you can before you actually go there .",1
i did n't expect our 5 full days of tour would not be sufficient to marvel at everything the city had to offer .,1
i would recommend to give a visit during the night to see the lights that go on every hour till midnight .,1
got to the top in about 30 mins .,1
come to find out it twinkles each our for about 5 minutes .,1
a lot of the main viewpoints have lights on them so still a fun time !,1
"the statue on its own is incredible but the views are breath taking , even to someone like me who 's terrified of heights .",1
"if you go to the top expect delays at mid way up , as you have to wait for people coming down and the lifts .",1
we had moved forward about 10 metres in half an hour .,1
he will give a rose to your female and then expect payment .,1
lots of pickpocketers at all the tourist spots in pars ... especially the eiffel tower .,1
there was not so long que to the elevators so i think its a good time of the year to visit it .,1
"you can stay yhere for 2 hours , we found 1 hourwas ample .",1
discovered that you had to queue again & pay extra if you wanted to go to the top .,1
"the view is awesome , even on a rainy day and it is so worth the time spent to get up there !",1
"if you feel adventurous and have good physical condition climb the stairs , you can go up to the second level and it is totally worth it .",1
it is easily accessible via metro line 6 station bir-hakeim .,1
wear a sweeter it can get really windy at the top,1
"all the constructions , the elevators .",1
the eiffel tower is absolutely amazing !,1
view from the top of the eiffel tower is very beautiful .,1
if i 'd had this advise i would have gone earlier so as to experience all the tower has to offer .,1
"despite having to run a gauntlet of cheap , cheesy souvenir stands on your way to the eiffel tower , seeing it up close is an amazing experience .",1
"we took a tour in order to visit the tower at night , we had a 9:30 tour and all i can say we 're the views were breath taking .",1
next time we come back to paris i would order the tickets on the official eiffel tower website where you can prepurchase the tickets for a specific time slot - but you need to do this month 's in advance .,1
this is a paris must-do .,1
our `` skip the line '' tour still had to wait for 1-1/2 hour to take the elevator up .,1
"had lunch at a nice restaurant , 58tour eiffel , with great views of paris .",1
the eiffel tower is one of the world 's iconic structures .,1
did a small group tour which was very informative .,1
"better watching it from somewhere far , not worth going up - the lines are too long .",1
i would definitely recommend to walk up as the queue is generally short -lrb- we only had to wait 15min to get to the front of the queue at 9am -rrb- and it is not a difficult climb .,1
tips : order you tickets on line months before you go !,1
"yes , the queues can be very lengthy , but the experience is an absolute must for any visitor to paris",1
the gypsies are in mass at this attraction because it brings so many tourist .,1
no visit to paris is complete without visiting this site .,1
i enjoyed my trip here .,1
we did not go up into the tower - it was very crowded and lines were extremely long .,1
rating is 4 star because of presence of lot of pickpocketers in spite of elaborate security arrangement which seems to be for the genuine visitors only .,1
i would recommend visiting it by day and by night .,1
"eiffel tower is a truly magnificent structure , it is almost impossible to believe that it was created by humans , and built in 1889 .",1
i took my wife to paris for her birthday and we loved the eiffel tower .,1
you will need to buy tickets at the base and then again at the first level .,1
ca n't go to paris without visiting this remarkable place .,1
what a disappointment !,1
we joined the queue at about 11:15 pm and got to the front at about midnight so i imagine earlier in the day you would be queuing for quite a while so i 'd advise having a drink and snacks in your bag .,1
we did n't make it all the way to the very top as access to this closes after a certain time but we still got gorgeous night views of the city from the two levels we did get to .,1
"if not walk on the grounds , then you will see from a distance .",1
the wait is hours long .,1
"we were able to see the military bunker and the elevator room , in addition to learning about other aspects of the tower 's history .",1
"you can bike around it , or just sit across the street in the gardens of trocadero just beware there are some construction on one side of the building .",1
"but it 's worth going , especially at night .",1
"we did not plan to go up because we had done so before , but were upset that we could n't get close to the area unless we bought a ticket .",1
"it could n't be as great as they were led to believe , right ?",1
there were already sold out .,1
the lines get pretty long .,1
"its a place to see the view from the top is beautiful , but the queing system as with everything in paris is very poor .",1
no visitor to paris should miss visiting the eiffel tower and experiencing the magnificent views over the city from the top .,1
"i would n't necessarily recommend going to the top as the view of paris is to have the eiffel tower part of it so i would recommend going to montmartre , notre dame , or the arc de triomphe to take pictures of the paris skyline with the eiffel tower in view .",1
make the effort and go again does n't matter how often you 've seen it .,1
we booked a timed ticket to the second floor prior to arrival in paris at a time one hour prior to dusk .,1
"whenever we hear the word paris , the first that comes into our minds is the eiffel tower , the most popular and iconic landmark of the city .",1
i was sceptical about paying the go up but it was well worth it and enjoyable too .,1
surroundings are amazing to walk and take pictures .,1
later realised the queue was less since it was by stairs gate .,1
when your in paris .,1
beautiful night and day,1
"once we had walked away from the tower and down the river a little , the tower looked great ... especially at night when it is lit up and the revellers/tack is hidden by darkness .",1
i wonder if this experience would be worth the money ?,1
waited in queue for around 1 hour from start to getting in the lift well worth it tho for the views,1
we had a terrific lunch as well .,1
the eiffel tower is beautiful and breathtaking .,1
"the eiffel tower is amazing but much more when you stop to think about how it was all built so long ago , even to build one today with modern machinery would be difficult , imagine back then !",1
"did n't go up , tickets sold out , need to book in advance , but did n't matter went to the tour de montepasse which has a great viewing platform would recommend it .",1
do n't miss it !!,1
this is the second time visiting the eiffel tower still cant get enough of this beautiful tower .,1
i still enjoyed it and had great views of the city even on a rainy day .,1
at night the tower and surroundings are lit which makes it even more beautiful .,1
"the view is breathtaking , walking up to the tower gives you goosebumps !",1
truly amazing experience .,1
"i would definitely do again , and as i said , just avoid the base , hold your wallet tight , and keep moving ...",1
"we went from the security/check-in line , which took about 20 minutes to get through , and then had to decide whether we wanted tickets to the second level of the tower , or tickets to ride the lift to the top , which also includes the second level .",1
i was in paris just yesterday !,1
its a must do when visiting paris and worth the money to dine in the 58 tour eiffel or jules verne restaurants,1
"it 's a must visit during the night with the lights , but a day visit is just as beautiful .",1
how can you not give this place and ` excellent ' rating .,1
"however , they do serve champagne at the peak but it 's not cheap !",1
excellent experience both for early morning exercise to climb to first level and the magnificent view,1
you will have time at the amazing eiffel tower for amazing incredible views over the french capital and beyond which will take your breath away .,1
the views are amazing and we saw the most beautiful sunset too !,1
standing under the structure was awesome .,1
great visit up the tower .,1
"the lighting at night is impressive , and during our visit , there were many street vendors nearby for a range of affordable food , and neat souvenirs .",1
probably the best time to go is after 6 pm so you can see part of the day and at night also .,1
do n't miss out !,1
pay the extra cost to skip the line : it 's worth it !,1
this is the third time i visit paris and every time seeing the eiffel tower gives me shivers .,1
what lovely sights .,1
see the colors change -- from a distance -- the night of the eurocup finals was extraordinary !,1
there was a place to purchase champagne at the top .,1
"i climbed the tower twice , and it 's doable .",1
it was a very relaxed family atmosphere .,1
this time on my france visit we went up to the second floor and the views were amazing !,1
wheelchair users are not allowed to the very top .,1
so make sure that if you intend to go up that you plan in a lot of time to wait around and que !,1
we were seated in a room with other american 's .,1
"be sure and check out the gardens at the foot of the tower , they are known as spots for romantic interludes .",1
be sure to preorder your tickets ahead of time,1
we loved to visit again !,1
"we were on a coach trip which stopped in the french capitol for an hour , so took the opportunity to take in some of the sights .",1
"the service was friendly , we were not rushed ; the dinner was delicious and the view was wonderful .",1
going to the top is a must !,1
the atmospher was like waiting for fireworks to happen at new year 's eve .,1
i was in awe when i saw the eiffel tower for the first time .,1
"however , mostly after 10 pm when the lights are on !",1
paris is beautiful .,1
even from the ground .,1
very good .,1
it is beautiful at a distance and impressive standing beneath it .,1
amazing views all around .,1
though there is a nice festive environment around it .,1
would be a great time to get pictures !,1
nice day spectacular views .,1
kept getting glimpses of it in the distance throughout my travels through paris but being up close was unbelievable !,1
"even if you are afraid of heights , go up to the lower level , it is a work of art that must be enjoyed .",1
"eiffel looked georgeous at night , i was literally blinded by the lights .",1
the line grew the entire time we were there .,1
typically i would say that i 'm not in to touristy things but the eiffel tour is a must see .,1
the glass flooring on one of the levels is awesome .,1
enjoy the parisian skyline by buying a ticket and acending to the main level .,1
i did n't have to wait long in the line for the lift to go up the tower .,1
long queuing though but worth it .,1
it 's a super romantic place to be at night time when it light up .,1
we went at night on a separate day -lrb- without going up -rrb- to enjoy the light show .,1
this was truly one of the most iconic sights in the world !,1
can get busy on the weekend .,1
the staff was friendly and the food great .,1
my boyfriend and i went to the very top -lrb- not expensive at all -rrb- and the views of the city were amazing .,1
definitely recommend going .,1
just be aware of what is going on while you are looking up and taking all of those pictures .,1
also one of the most recognizable structures and the most-visited paid monument in the world .,1
go to the trocadéro and you will have a perfect view !,1
one of the highlights of our honeymoon .,1
booked tickets in advance - so save on the massive queues .,1
watch out for the guys with the roses too .,1
straight to the bag check and we were taken to look at the lift machinery which was actually really interesting !,1
do so .,1
"early mornings , before tourists and souvenir peddlers show up is the best .",1
standing underneath the et is absolutely sublime ; it stands in perfect symmetry in the middle of the sky alone .,1
the good side to that was the lines were small .,1
it 's a very busy place with lots of souvenir sellers and what appear to be eastern european con artists but do n't let that put you off .,1
we only had to wait about 45 minutes .,1
remember the tower sparkles on the hour,1
it is great from afar and even better up close !,1
we were pleasantly surprised by only paying $ 14 for both of us !!,1
the grounds around the tower are very large and offer an opportunity for a nice walk and a view of some interesting monuments and art work in the area .,1
"each time i go out there or am just passing by it , it has been a magical moment as if i am a tourist seeing it for the very first time !!",1
"i bought a mug & a medium size eiffel tower model , needless to say it was pricey but one has to do these things .",1
i loved the place so much that we went two times in two days at night and at day .,1
all my life i 've wanted to visit the eiffel tower .,1
on our 3rd visit we queued and went in .,1
"definitely , come at night time when the tower is all lite up , to be honest the eiffel tower is not much by day but at night it is in a league of its own .",1
there is a nice little bar on the 1st floor where you can have a beer and sit of swing bar stools which was very cool,1
number one place to visit ... you have to go if you visit paris ... and you wo n't be dissipointed ... pre - puchase your ticket .,1
this iconic tower can be seen from many areas in town .,1
well organised entrance and exits .,1
we queued for quite a while to get tickets but it does keep moving .,1
quite impressive and beautiful in person .,1
cut the queues by taking the stairs and buying a ticket for the top lift at the bottom .,1
"there was a good atmosphere and the people selling things -lrb- tower trinkets , laser pointers and wine/champagne -rrb- were not pushy or persistent .",1
it was the lift all the way on this visit but it is possible to walk to the second stage and then get the lift from there .,1
"anyway , i would say that given the large number of people visiting , they could more organised .",1
make sure you take into account the wait for the tickets and elevator when planning your trip .,1
"the south leg was n't working when we were there , so not sure about the lift situation there .",1
one more tick off the to do list !,1
"we also visit mont martre , louvre museum , we also went to bruges .",1
the views are stunning and can not be beaten .,1
"a stunning landmark , with observational points before you reach the summit so you dont have to go all the way to the tip .",1
"the price was reasonable , and we 're glad we went , but we found most of our time was spent queuing for the lifts both up and down from the various floors .",1
but the light display on the tower at night is worth seeing .,1
we also watched the gorgeous paris sunset which was marvellous .,1
"although the view is amazing , it was hard to walk around at all as they are doing some maintenance work at the moment so the hoarding is blocking some of the walkways .",1
we took in the views and also had a very enjoyable lunch at the on site restaurant .,1
"unfortunately , due to the chilly temps we did n't wait in line to go up .",1
i felt that it is something you do to tick off your bucket list but maybe i am just dissapointed that i could n't go to the top .,1
it 's a very nice way to visit this attraction .,1
"however , it is definitely impressive .",1
this guy waved his detector around but took no notice if it buzzed .,1
"i went to the summit , toasted with champagne and also ate lunch in the tour 55 eiffel .",1
by day or by night a sight to marvel .,1
a great view from the top !,1
an amazing and must see spot both during the day and night when the lights are on .,1
they closed the right section so you cant see anything .,1
we were lining up to go up and down .,1
"kids played at the park along the champs de mars , had fun on the carrossel , and enjoyed the trip up to the observation deck on the eiffel tower .",1
"ever since i watched sex and the city and heard carrie bradshaw 's old russian ballet beau describe the eiffel tower as the structure with the `` silly lights '' , and ever since i heard the historical story of how the united states and france were competing against each other - large carousel versus eiffel tower , my desire to see the eiffel tower diminished .",1
"i recommend going there in the morning , we did n't have to stand in line as there was just a bunch of tourists .",1
wall to wall people pushed up against plexiglass .,1
it 's been a long time since i visited the tower .,1
riding one of the velib city bikes to the eiffel tower is a must do while in paris .,1
each stage brings something different .,1
it is better to be on the top deck and get the full view and enjoy the moment .,1
we did n't make it to the top due to queues -lrb- so advance tickets only help you get to the 2nd floor -rrb- other than that there is no real advantage !,1
breath taking views on a perfect day !,1
its worth the wait and the aggravation .,1
buy the ticket to get to top by elevator .,1
absolutely wonderful !,1
public toilets and drinking water available,1
"i 'm middle aged and not particularly fit , but managed it !",1
no visit to paris would be complete without a visit to the eiffel tower .,1
try !,1
"rude staff , too much crowd , too much queueing .",1
"while visiting paris , one ca n't miss eiffel tower.this super structure is amazing , and well maintained.one can go upto third level.i visited upto second level only.lifts and stairs , both are available.these days strict security is being maintained to avoid any mishappening.at first level glass platform is there and one can stand over it and can see ground below him.eatables are available at both first & second level.this structure is made from 10000 tonnes of steel and 330 metres in height .",1
"we then went straight to get our ticket to walk up the stairs , with no queues ... was great .",1
"not too many people took the stairs , the line was longer getting through security than it was to climb .",1
obviously a `` must do '' while in paris .,1
"we booked online to miss queues , just had to wait in queue to get ticket to take you to the summit , but was not a long wait .",1
"there was hardly anybody there , and we managed to get those perfect pictures with hardly any tourists in the background .",1
whenever you visit this place be sure to take a look at the iron work .,1
what a 360 degree view of paris ... you must do this .,1
buy them well in advance !,1
"long lines moved fast to buy tickets , less than an hour .",1
"wonderful views from the trocadero , palace de chaillot , you can if you like entre the tower , but to just stand underneath/beside the tower is inspiring .",1
"now climbing the 1,000 odd stair is a great way to get warm and you do n't have to wait for the lift .",1
"they do n't really explain much of anything -lrb- no signs -rrb- , which is part of why it takes quite a while .",1
the eiffel tower was an excellent place to stay with 360 degree views across paris .,1
my wife was a first time visitor on this occasion so she enjoyed the eiffel tower .,1
had a great visit all the same .,1
literally midnight 12:00 !!,1
we were here on the day of eurofanfest 2016 and there were crowds all around but still the tower was impressive .,1
but there are huge lines for booking for elevators as well as for who did the advance booking .,1
c'est la vie !,1
the eiffel tower is one of the truly remarkable and romantic places in the world .,1
it was cold and drizzly .,1
every time i saw eiffel tower on tv/movie there was a strong urge to visit this place and sure it did not disappoint me .,1
"a tower joining heaven and earth , the eiffel tower epitomizes the spirit of france .",1
the view is incredible and the whole experience a must-do-once-in-your-lifetime one !,1
a definite mist if you are in the city of love .,1
we went to the first and second levels and had lunch at the café .,1
love how you get different views from all over paris .,1
fantastic experience - glad we booked online so we could just go straight up .,1
high ticket prices !,1
"it is a very beautiful experience , and even better if the weather is good .",1
just beautiful !,1
toilet facilities are available here .,1
it is a bit of a ` must do ' when you are in paris and i can see why and would recommend it .,1
so they do stick to the time .,1
enjoyable visit particularly at dusk when taking a boat river cruise .,1
3 adults and 2 pre-teens visited and we loved it .,1
"as for the views on the eiffel tower , the first and second levels are a must !",1
should have given us earphones to keep our hands free !,1
you ??,1
the eiffel tower is a blast .,1
they cram everyone into the lift and up you go .,1
"on everyone 's ` must-do ' list , the tower is worth the trouble , although trouble it is !",1
i did n't catch it from the plane nor while i was in the metro on the way to it .,1
"the queue was n't too long , we probably waited 30min to get our tickets then 20min from security to the 2nd floor of the tower .",1
"third , go to the top .",1
just remember it was a gift from america to say thank you for the war efforts back in the day .,1
if you come to paris and do n't visit eiffel tower it 's just you have n't been in paris .,1
one has to see the eiffel tower when in paris !,1
"unless you 're a tourist that enjoys taking selfies of yourself in front of `` famous '' landmarks , the eiffel tower is something best seen from afar , if at all .",1
the artwork is incredible .,1
"i will highly recommend families to take a vacation to this beatiful city we went for thanksgiving week and had a blast , osiel solis from dallas , texas",1
"visit the eiffel tower on a mid week evening to enjoy the tower all dressed in sparkles , avoid the weekends ... simply too crowded ...",1
"despite the crowds , which is a given at any iconic building , the eiffel tower lived up to all my expectations .",1
"as one of the ca n't miss sights though , expect large crowds , pushy vendors and be very watchful for pick pockets .",1
"to get down , you go back to the 2nd level .",1
it is also a good place to get your bearing in paris should you get lost .,1
to much refugees and everybody wants to sell you souverniers when you walking around .,1
be aware of scammers playing games on streets .,1
this turned out great as we were up there during sunset .,1
it can be seen from afar but needs to be examined up close and one needs to travel in the elevators to appreciate the intricacies of the construction and the views it affords over the wonderful city of paris .,1
go on a clear sunny day .,1
great city view .,1
"we could n't book a time slot , i have a feeling they have stopped this .",1
"if you are going to paris for the first time , than you must go !",1
"best view of the tower would definitely be from the troccadero , and then take a walk down towards the tower .",1
"spend some time at each level , drink in the city !!",1
"even though i have been in paris many time , i always enjoy a breif visit to this unique land mark .",1
we did the sunset tour and it was well worth it .,1
i did n't climb the eiffel tower but i did have a picnic near it .,1
had to que for a while but did n't mind at all !,1
it is pretty chilly at the top !,1
"if you wo n't get the tickets online before your visit , make sure you know which ticket line to choose when you get there .",1
we bought tickets online to avoid the lines and it was a lifesaver .,1
it 's cheap to go up there and having dinner in there is a unique experience .,1
seeing the eiffel tower in real so mesmerising .,1
"food and service was outstanding , view priceless .",1
no wonder it attracts so many admirers .,1
we did do lunch here but i would n't recommend it .,1
good atmosphere despite the strike !,1
sleep below it to be able to admire it a lot .,1
"the line for the lifts to take you to the 1st , 2nd and top floors are ridiculously long .",1
it still takes my breath away .,1
btw we went in august on a friday evening and the line to buy tickets and get in was hundreds long .,1
lovely place and well securitized .,1
"visited whilst in paris for the weekend , the tower is worth the visit although we queued a while the views are worth it .",1
is gorgeous all lit up at night !,1
very touristy and i would n't bother with the restaurants .,1
loved my day here .,1
"one cue to buy the ticket the next cue to walk through the scanner and the next one to get to the extreme top of the tower , it was a 9re than 3 hours of cuing and that exhausted us .",1
you really can see the whole of paris from the second floor .,1
good see a tall and giant structure .,1
well,1
"however , if you wish to reach the summit by elevator -lrb- which is recommendable unless very fit -rrb- book in advance !!!",1
this landmark is iconic for many reasons and a sight for the day time but even more beautiful in the evening !,1
we took the steps back down .,1
it gives a fantastic view of paris .,1
the view from a distance is so much nicer .,1
the skip the line pass is essential and worth the investment .,1
not great organisation but we got there in the end !,1
we tried to book the fast track tickets but they were fully booked/sold out .,1
we went up about 8:30 pm and stayed until all the lights came on .,1
a must see and the view from the top is breathtaking !,1
a late dinner nearby and a short walk makes for a beautiful night .,1
the guys selling the made in china souvenirs are a bit more pushy now and are everywhere .,1
this is a must for everybody .,1
we paid just $ 17 each & found the queues not particularly bad .,1
it is the one thing you must see in paris .,1
it 's best to get there early to beat the crowds which makes a big difference especially when you are trying to get a good view from one of the viewing platforms .,1
an engineering perfection of note .,1
"they cost a bit more , but it was worth it .",1
mid day is jammed .,1
either book a skip-the-line your or arrive early and avoid the wait !,1
it felt magical !,1
you wo n't be allowed to leave things there so my tip is do n't take any form of glass bottles as there 's nowhere to leave after security check .,1
just what i was expecting .,1
the whole atmosphere over the river seine with the eiffel tower looming over it is so romantic and serene .,1
"please , from one very proud american to another , dress casually but not for a backyard bbq -lrb- unless your backyard is in the hamptons -rrb- and even though you 're outside , use your indoor voices .",1
"a must see , a must do , you do n't need to always wait and go to the top , but you must get close and take as many pictures as you can .",1
"the view from the climb is great as well , however getting up can be a nightmare with the number of people .",1
can get crowded but plenty of places to grab a coffee nearbyp,1
the day was a bit foggy so photos dont do it justice .,1
"we purchased the eiffel tower dinner so i went up to skip the line only to ask , & the security let us straight through .",1
we timed our visit to be their when light show appeared on the hour .,1
"been a couple of times , still a fabulous view on a clear day .",1
"of all the paces we visited in paris , the eiffel tower felt the least safe .",1
got down here quickly via the metro .,1
"i got the fish and it was not well cooked , the chicken was just that chicken .",1
beware of people wanting to have you sign petitions on behalf of the homeless .,1
"painted with her own eiffel tower brown paint but shimmering with sparkling lights , there is nothing like the eiffel tower .",1
i loved taking the opportunity and it would have been quite stunning at night but we were there in the morning .,1
we chose a tour of 2 hours .,1
"if you have n't booked tickets in advance , like us , do n't worry .",1
"so beautiful , so unique , magical at night when it lights up , buskers around making it feel even more special , went to the top in the lift , brilliant views",1
once inside the compound choose the elevator or stairs queue .,1
but once on top it was perfection .,1
just beautiful !!,1
"great experience from start to finish , well worth it !",1
it only takes about 5 minutes to walk up to the first level -lrb- with no stopping -rrb- and another 5 minutes to walk to the second level .,1
you will be in awe of the fantastic light show each evening starting at 10:00 p.m. during the summer months .,1
"we then headed inside , to our surprise there was n't much at the base to do .",1
then we walked up the stairs to the second level .,1
we had dinner at the restaurant on the 1st floor and it was an incredible and memorable experience .,1
"i did enjoy the view , however the price for a glass of champagne was outrageous !",1
i highly recommend purchasing your tickets in advance .,1
"only when you see it in real , you understand .",1
"we went during the euro cup , not sure if the extra security precautions were in place just for that visit .",1
truly magnificent .,1
"if you 're too scared to even show up , then they win .",1
great to get photos of paris from .,1
you know what this is the type of place that never gets old .,1
view is outstanding .,1
"on the way down , make sure you stop and see the level that has the glass floor because it has animations that are really informative and cool about the building of the tower .",1
well worth the visits .,1
"our last visit was just as a couple over 15 years ago , we took out young kids this time and they loved it .",1
"also nver miss the night view , it is amazing",1
truly wonderful .,1
"at that age , there was awe about the magnitude of the structure and views .",1
"if you are not on a strict budget and do n't have a fear of heights , spring the extra money to go to the top as opposed to the 2nd floor - though you can get a good view from the 2nd floor , the top is much more of an experience .",1
just be there at 10 p.m at the top of the trocadero and you 'll have a view you will never forget.try to have the same view during the day -lrb- in order to make the comparison -rrb- .,1
the tower lights up every hour and watching it from the gardens is a treat to the eyes .,1
it was night and the view was spectacular even foggy !,1
"we did a tour , which was very quick paced .",1
"that took us to an underground bunker , under the tower to see the gears and such , and moved us to the head of lines ... but i 'm not sure i would do that again .",1
one never gets tired of visiting one of the most marvelous wonders of europe .,1
walking up the stairs is easy enough and paying extra for the first lift is n't necessary .,1
"they say paris is the `` city of love '' and if it was n't for the eiffel , it would n't be the same .",1
everyone who first lays eyes upon madam eiffel would have already seen her twice .,1
went back at night to get photos of it lit up .,1
the sunset view of the city was just perfect .,1
we had dinner at the eiffel tower and thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the views .,1
whatever you do buy tickets online and breeze right though !,1
"go in the daytime , stay until it 's dark and watch it twinkle ...",1
"just go and see it , you wo n't be disappointed .",1
"what you can write about this masterpiece ... eiffel tower , what else ?",1
it was $ 34 for 2 adults to go to the top which is reasonable i suppose as there no time limitation for how long you stay up there .,1
we could n't get to the top -lrb- closed for maintenance -rrb- but the view from the 2nd level it was still astounding -lrb- running out of superlative adjectives with this one !!! -rrb-,1
"we recommend going to the top , make sure you purchase tickets ahead ... wait times are otherwise quite long .",1
we went straight up the tower avoiding the many people queueing to get tickets .,1
you do n't need to make a reservation beforehand because if you are at the tower before 11am you can buy them at the tower .,1
"in fact , upon our first glimpse of the eiffel while riding the taxi to our hotel , it was so beautiful !",1
easily reachable by metro or hop on bus .,1
myself and my partner visited paris over the valentines weekend .,1
"a must see , much bigger in real life .",1
the lights in the evening added to the amazing view of paris .,1
the first level also had ice skating ... on the eiffel tower !,1
it sometimes is over an hour !,1
"on this visit , after a wonderful final dinner in paris , we got to the eiffel at 1115 pm .",1
"not only is it a must when in paris , it really is worth it .",1
scamming tourists out of $ 100 - $ 200,1
this place is really super .,1
"had to wait at ground level for 10 minutes , but second level nearly an hour !",1
buy your tickets online to avoid horrendous lines .,1
a first visit in paris is not complete without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
but it is amazingly built and very impressive .,1
i love the fact you can see it from almost anywhere in paris .,1
"go all the way to the top for only $ 17 euros , it 's so worth it .",1
no matter how many times you visit the tower it 's simply wonderful .,1
i find it very uplifting and comforting to see it .,1
top tip - watch for pickpockets -lrb- obvs -rrb- .,1
a must see tourist attraction .,1
"we were in a group of 30 and we met our guide at 4.00 pm , who gave us a history lesson and stayed with us until level 2 .",1
watch out for skippers !,1
queued for a long time but the line keeps moving quite fast .,1
look out for pickpockets as they are rife here .,1
i have been to paris a few times but a visit to the tower is always a must !!,1
"after going back down , we walked to the center of the tower underneath it .",1
we went early in the morning and the queue for the tickets was n't too bad ... .,1
it is worth the wait and the views are great .,1
this place is just magical !,1
this is a bucket-list place to visit .,1
we queued for 30 minutes and got to only second floor .,1
beautiful but crazy queues for lifts .,1
i would have queued for hours to have made the ascent .,1
the views are dramatic and worth all the effort .,1
the next is just the elevator to the top .,1
"it 's magical , especially at night when it lights up in sparkly lights every hour from 7 .",1
very very very long waiting in line to buy a ticket and it was too hot that day .,1
yes the people are not as `` customer servicey '' as we americans but who cares about them .,1
once through entered a short 10min queue for security then another longer 20min queue for the first lift to the 1st level .,1
it is one of those tourist attractions that must be seen .,1
had a lovely clear day so enjoyed the views very much .,1
these are better because your view then includes the tower .,1
"also , do n't bother going all the way up if the weather is crappy , you wo n't see anything anyways .",1
at night it is unreal .,1
in the second floor there are places to eat and plenty of souvenirs shops .,1
but for 7 pound per person it was worth it .,1
i used subway from porte maillot to champs de mars - tour eiffel station to reach the eiffel tower .,1
the long waiting line sent us walking around the tower and taking many pictures with tons tourists in it .,1
"well , the eiffel tower .",1
"visit this after evening , the view of eiffel is amazing only in night , in daytime its just a iron tower .",1
"for reference , we visited in april and i purchased the tickets in january - do n't chance waiting to purchase if you know you want to visit .",1
the view at night is equally exciting .,1
"u cant visit paris without visiting this iconic tower , in all cases it s impossible to make a tour in paris without stopping and seeing it !",1
"all loved the climb , the views , everything ... definitely worth a visit",1
"try to get tickets previously , travel agencies , guides , whatever , because the queues to buy tickets are a pain and can take hours of one time .",1
"our guide was informative and were allowed as much free time as we wanted to take photos and admire the views , after her tour .",1
"lineups are long , so be prepare to wait an hour .",1
the tower ` sparkles ' on the hour which is also nice to see too .,1
a must go !,1
lots of picture moments at every angle and try to take the stairs down for the experience .,1
the view however should be seen in both day and night as the evening lights are spectacular .,1
"although it was cold and raining , the essence is enough to take your breath away !",1
"it is just a piece of iron , and neither well kept .",1
none of these things were a worry .,1
"i would suggest to walk up , it is more interesting then just use elevators .",1
the fact that it was built when it was really adds to its grandeur .,1
definitely go all the way to the top !!!,1
rainy day did not matter the views from every level are more than amazing !,1
i found if you did n't make eye contact and were aware of your surroundings you were okay .,1
"built in 1887-89 for the 1889 world ' fair , the eiffel tower remains an iconic symbol recognizable across the world .",1
"all ok , given the circumstances that paris has had forced on it .",1
we had champagne at the top which was a moment we will remember forever .,1
lights are wonderful to see at night from anywhere in the city but to be under it is very nice and romantic .,1
we waited in line to get the tickets for over and hour and then again to get into the first elevator for another hour .,1
"rain , shine , night or day the view is always a spectacle in itself , but the journey to get there is even better .",1
always top of the list for visitors to paris .,1
the ticket for the top is 17 $ / person but you have to pay extra 17 $ or 22 $ to drink shampagne at the bar .,1
"do n't know what i thought the tower was all about , but it was thrilling in many ways - the elegant 19th century engineering a la arte nouveau , the views , the atmosphere ?",1
i wish i could have purchased a ticket in advance for later than 5pm as sunset want till 7:30 .,1
come back after dark to watch the strobe lights flashing up and down the tower at the top of each hour .,1
you get one lift a bit like a funicular to the second floor then take a second lift to the top .,1
wonderful structure and u must be lucky enough to visit it !,1
i love this place to come all the time we came 4 year a go for 20th anniversary we both enjoyed now i book for few countries visit every were & my 24th anniversary day was in paris so good to see night light we had night toor as well we relay enjoyed,1
"when you get to the tower , from the river -lsb- seine -rsb- side , go to the rear right foot of the tower .",1
we are glad we did .,1
a must for everyone 's bucket list will put anyone in the mood for love .,1
a bit crowded at both the second level and summit bit definitely worth it .,1
"it 's the eiffel tower , one of the coolest structures in the work and to think it was almost torn down !",1
the night views are spectacular the way it lights up .,1
second visit was at night to see the lightings .,1
"unbelievable , breathtaking , hard to describe , you have to see to believe.lots of people and ques.lots of security makes you feel safe",1
we have never been to paris before so we felt we needed to see it from the top of the eiffel tower .,1
this cuts out queues of at least 2 and up to 5 hours .,1
i suggest walking up to the second floor and taking the elevator from there .,1
no chance to go up .,1
"-lrb- assumption they ca n't speak france or they have thinking who can speak france is local person -rrb- , then they showing a paper to you , and one hand push the paper to your body then another hand move under paper try reach your pocket / bags/wallet to take anything .",1
my teenage daughter and her friend thought it was so cool that they could buy alcohol and they bought two small bottles of wine .,1
"even though we visited the eiffel tower two years in a row , we would definitely visit it again if we travel to paris .",1
it is amazing how large it really is from underneath .,1
one must be terribly wrong if you think this is the end of all the waiting .,1
i could not believe how breath taking this was .,1
each stage offers incredible views but you 'd be remiss to miss the top .,1
there are signs everywhere warning of pickpockets and i was careful with my purse .,1
"we climbed the stairs for the first 2 levels , then rode an elevator to the top .",1
great to see the hardwork behind it .,1
fabulously inspiring iconic landmark .,1
"i went to the summit of the eiffel tower , so did the three levels , the day was a bit hazy and overcast so the view was n't 100 % clear but you could still get a good view .",1
"i went all the way using the stairs , its good but it 's a long way !",1
going up to the 2nd floor of the tower and the 1.5 hour cruise showed us through the historic city .,1
"the tower was amazing when we seen it at night , a must.went back next day to see again and was beautiful and fountains were nice.a lot of peddlers selling trinkets and such but really not much of a bother .",1
"if you can purchase tickets ahead of time , it 's worth it .",1
"there was some queuing , but that 's expected .",1
i would rate this as the number 1 attraction in paris and try to go in the evening to get the best of the view in the light and the dark !,1
it 's truly an amazing view .,1
"while we grownups sat at one of the tables mid-way up , the boys ran up and down , oohing and aahing .",1
this was an evening tour and the view was amazing .,1
unforgettable experience that will always live with me .,1
how can you not find this site amazing ?,1
views from tower are good .,1
there are nearly 700 stairs but the climb is worthwhile .,1
"however , please note that your ticket does not advance you to the top level without having to wait in a different , tedious line .",1
:-rrb- stay and read the interesting info posted .,1
initially had planned to walk up to the 2nd level only but then wife found a skip the line deal with fat tire tour group the day before .,1
i am amazed with the size of the tower .,1
we were searching about it 's history and we respect the one made this tower so much .,1
"however , during the queue one thing i have noticed is that there are 6 booths and only 2 are open , would have been much quicker and better if all is open as it was during peak hours as well .",1
"definitely a `` bucket list '' type of occasion , and very impressive and fun -lrb- and expensive , but worth it imo -rrb- .",1
good view saw all of the city from there and at night the lights were beautiful loots of nice moments to see,1
had lunch at 58 restaurant .,1
"fabulous views , if you like that kind of thing.not for me personally but my wife loves the tower .",1
go to the tower so that you can appreciate the views during the day/twilight and night .,1
"i drove to paris from leeds with my girlfriend in a car we bought for # 500 on the first night we visited the eiffel tower , i underestimated how big this piece of architectural engineering actually is , we queued for approximately 20 mins to take the lift to the 2nd floor the view 's were breathtaking you could see the whole 360 degree view of paris .",1
take your ipad and pre book ticket to go up the tower to beat the 2 or more hour queues .,1
once inside the man insisted my boyfriend unfolded the ticket paper for him -lrb- was he not capable ?,1
long lines to get up and off the tower .,1
"took some great pictures of the eiffel tower , and a large carousel , then walked across the bridge to the eiffel tower .",1
this was our second visit and this time we pre-booked before we went - well worth doing .,1
it is not very expensive at 11 euros each .,1
"our family has done this twice now , the rink is open during the holidays , price of ticket gets you skates at the rink .",1
looking across the city and finding it from wherever you are is truly an incredible sight to take in .,1
however this time the queue was only 30 mins and i 'm so glad i made the effort .,1
so do n't get fooled up there but enjoy the view .,1
over six million people visit this monument every year .,1
was still beautiful in my eyes .,1
also a cafe that is not too overpriced .,1
lots of police during the day .,1
we pre purchased tickets to the top .,1
"if your up for it , the queue is much shorter to climb the tower and it was a fun experience !",1
even standing underneath it is inspiring .,1
expensive to go up in the elevator and must be booked well in advance and is for a specific date and time and you must be there on time or you will lose out .,1
this is a scam to distract you whilst another accomplice steals from you .,1
crowds and lines may be a turnoff if it is very hot or rainy .,1
"it was pretty easy to see why as the queue snaked around the whole floor and waiting time was 1.5 hours plus , so we decided to give it a miss as we could see everything we needed to from the second floor .",1
from 8pm when it lights up on the hour it is just stunning .,1
beautiful city that smell like piss ...,1
"it is however too , too many people , including aggressive vendors supposedly collecting for a charity .",1
almost impossible to pre-buy tickets for travel dates closer than a couple of months out .,1
the view from the top is really spectacular.the ticket to the top -lrb- sommet -rrb- costs euro 15.5 per adult .,1
the line to go to the top want a long wait and the restaurant up top serves great beer .,1
you must seeee this fantastic and magical place .,1
we could n't get tickets on line 2 months in advance so ended up having to sign up with a tour .,1
there is no need to buy tickets online .,1
it was lovely to stroll around beneath the eiffel tower .,1
the outlook was great .,1
recommend going late in the evening as the queues are much shorter than in the day,1
we arrived at 9am for the tower opening time but even then the queues were huge .,1
a word of caution - lookout for people who may con or steal your money/stuff .,1
the whole place was packed as you would expect for a saturday afternoon in august so we joined one of the queues awaiting to go up the tower .,1
wonderful structure which seems to stretch toward heaven .,1
they do not stay on all night which is ashame .,1
high enough for me !,1
be prepared for long ques if your looking to get the lift if your legs arnt quite up to the challenge of the walk up !,1
"although i have been to taller places before , this tower has more history than most other tall man-made towers , making it more than a worthwhile attraction to visit .",1
nice view form the top of the eiffel tower .,1
seeing the city at night from the top makes it all worth it .,1
no way would i ever ever do it again but -- it was worth it after all was said and done !,1
no words to describe and we have to feel the moment .,1
visiting the eiffel tower is a must when going to paris .,1
very very busy on the 2 days i visited .,1
got there about 4pm waited to get through security then saw the line to go up inside ... was way too !,1
you will definitely want to do the wine selections they offer .,1
its totally difference kind of experience since you could see the metal structure of the tower more clearly .,1
but we did spend the valentines day in paris and at the eiffel tower .,1
wow amazing ... .,1
"we took the elevator to the top floor of the eiffel towel at sunset , the plan was to see the day time as well as night time ; however , sun goes down very quickly , or i should say there are too many people get in line -lrb- to go to the top floor -rrb- .",1
used metro from hotel to tower .,1
i would highly recommend to go here early as it gets really busy .,1
of course a must see when visiting paris .,1
the restaurant is just visit but needs to be booked in advance .,1
there is an eiffel tower goodies shop below the eiffel tower to purchase some memories .,1
"went with my young family and we thoroughly enjoyed the visit , i would recommend whole heartedly , very beautiful structure .",1
"oh , my , it was such a delight when we came up out of the metro station and knew we were close -- but asked a guy to point us in the right direction .",1
whats a trip to paris without the eiffel tower .,1
you can climb the stairs of the tower or you can take the lift .,1
the tower and the surrounding garden is so pretty with the river flowing .,1
there are these cool mugs with dimonties on them which i did n't buy cause i thought i could get one cheaper in town .,1
"this is a lovely thing to see , the life around it is special in itself especially when you hear the gasps of ohh and ahh and photo opportunitys all around .",1
"romantic destination , filled with families and couples .",1
get tickets ahead of time if you can .,1
hopefully they 'll get to solve the waiting times .,1
but when you are in the central parts of paris you gon na see it .,1
of course this means not knowing what the weather will be but we were lucky and had a day that was mostly cloudy with patches of sun .,1
very relaxing and calm .,1
"we visited the tower during our paris stay , without a doubt a wonderful piece of engineering and a breath taking view of paris from the various platforms , especially the top .",1
my boyfriend and i spent hours around the eiffel tower but there is nothing like getting into and going up the eiffel tower .,1
a must do if this is your first and fiftieth visit to paris .,1
all together a must see .,1
"security was good , queues and staff quick .",1
visited eiffel tower with thomas cook india and they took use to the second level .,1
we took a tour with city tours and was fast tracked through the crowd and went to the top .,1
"the ride to the first platform was wonderful and still about 2/3rds of the way to the top , so quite high .",1
not the same paris i knew since before !,1
we included this on our self-guided day of touristy french stuff .,1
we visited in the evening and got to see the sunset over the city .,1
it 's a to do thing if you visit paris .,1
"great views of paris - we had prebooked tickets to the second level and we went straight in without any waiting time and we were also able to go to the very top for only 6 eur extra per person ,",1
amazing to be on the eiffel tower have a lovely meal .,1
the views of paris are incredible from the top .,1
"if there is a must-see landmark for travelers visiting paris , this one is it .",1
b -rrb- a lot less money -rrb- c -rrb- more rewarding .,1
it is very much stay for as long as you want .,1
we arrived early and booked tickets for the 10am opening got to the top via lift and had a great view of paris came down slowly via stairs and lift,1
it was very crowded when we went and of course people are trying to sell items .,1
eiffel tower is always a must when in paris .,1
"then you queue to purchase your tickets inside , the longest queue , followed by another security check .",1
beware street vendors who sell crap .,1
"we visited the eiffel tower in july , which must be the biggest mistake we made on our trip to paris .",1
to go up tower .,1
i revisited with some co-workers on a crystal clear day in june and went to the top .,1
"take a bottle of wine , a picnic and sit and enjoy .",1
"the changing colours at night is awesome , do n't have words to describe it .",1
when leaving at night to say out farewells to the city and return to lyon .,1
i loved climbing the stairs to the 2nd level of the eiffel tower .,1
so we walked down the stairs .,1
the food was ok but not as good as the paris restaurant in las vegas,1
"a lot of boat trips go from here -lrb- which also means a lot of tacky souvenir sellers , but hey , you are in paris ! -rrb-",1
even if you do n't go up the tower stay for the changing light show .,1
"we also had to ward off a horde of street vendors that were quite annoying , never taking no for an answer.the day visit was magnificent but expensive .",1
it truly is a magnificent feat of engineering - wonderful .,1
"there was a lot going on , but it 's worth seeing if you 're in paris .",1
a great way to see paris from above with a dinner in the restaurant on the 1st level .,1
every hour in the night they have blinking lights which looks great .,1
we had seen the eiffel tower before but did not want to get in the lines to go up .,1
i had lunch on the first level and the food and view were top-notch .,1
it certainly was a memorable occasion if somewhatless than intimate !,1
you can also get a drink -lrb- we got champagne -rrb- from a booth .,1
get there early and the lines are not bad .,1
true romance ... she worked her magic again !,1
the structure and size of the tower make it so fantastic .,1
go early in the morning when the lines are not so long .,1
there is a lovely shady park next to it and many cafes a short walk around the corner .,1
gardens are lovely too .,1
we paid extra for a ticket to the summit but it was totally worth it !,1
save your time and skip a ride to any of the platforms unless you have pre-booked a ticket .,1
when it twinkles at night it 's like magic .,1
make sure you are there well before the top of the hour to get a good spot to take pics and of cause a selfie .,1
it felt very safe too,1
the tower is amazing - you would n't believe the enormity of it until you see it with your own eyes !,1
"the gardens in front are perfect for a picnic lunch during the day , wine and cheese at sunset , or champagne at night .",1
"it was around 9 pm , the city looks amazing at night .",1
this visit was very busy and crowded .,1
the bus tours get priority .,1
so we took the elevator .,1
must be seen at night.magical.what a structure.when i see news reports from paris with the eiffelin the background i wish i was back again there .,1
because we were part of a tour we went straight up to the restaurant and bypassed the quite long queue .,1
you need to go through metal detectors and have your bag and coat checked which is ok but a bit weird till you realise its everywhere in paris now : -lrb-,1
"for a first timer , sure make that obligatory visit but after 5 mins of stay go out and explore the rest of the city !",1
the tower shimmers at midnight and we watched it from a river cruise,1
but then that 's what you expect at such a popular destination .,1
the timing of our visit was not the best due to the recent attacks but with in days the eiffel tower was reopened and access was available for the public .,1
the queuing to get up to the 2nd floor was n't too bad but sadly the summit was sold out .,1
lunch was a pleasant surprise .,1
there were lots of souvenir stands that you could buy almost any kind of stuffs .,1
and also make sure you keep hold of bags as lots of signs of pickpockets about .,1
is it worth the wait ?,1
we went here last july month .,1
we got their early about 10 ish .,1
the view of the tower is great from every angle especially in the night .,1
not sure if the view would have been much better than we got but it was a bit of a disappointment .,1
"if you go later in the day , you can watch the sun set and wait for the twinkling lights to come on at the top of the hour .",1
"we got to see underground communication tunnels , the workings of the hydrollic elevator in the east pillar and then up to the 2nd level observation deck .",1
on the summit there is a little bar .,1
the view was fantastic but there was a lot of people .,1
in general this is a little gem .,1
"and i agree , it is a worthwhile site .",1
best time to visit is twilight being on the tower when it lights up is awesome and you get such a great view once finished as you leave of the tower all lit up !,1
infact the iconic eiffel tower is the face of paris attracting multitudes of tourists every year .,1
"it 's absolutely magnificent , no wonder it 's most-visited paid monument in the world !",1
"the wait for the elevator is too long , i recommend using the 328 steps to the first floor .",1
"if you are in the mood , you can take the elevator and go to the eiffel tower restaurant and have a bite .",1
it will be very cold.taking the stairs downward from the middle station is also a good experience .,1
"of course the eiffel toweri is no secret tip , but one of the most incredible and mind-blowing sights of the entire world and especially a must see for everyone that visits paris and brings some time and money to pay the rather cheap entrance price .",1
"we paid 11 euros each , didnt stay long as it was cold but its def worth a trip .",1
it was a 5 minute walk .,1
"once in paris we decided to test our luck and started from the hotel at around 8:30 am ; we took the very convenient metro line to trocadero station -lrb- nice picture perfect spot from here -rrb- , and walked across to the ticket office right underneath the tower .",1
i have been back 3 times since then and i always go to the tower .,1
get reservations because the stand by line was quite long .,1
i would recommend to buy your tickets before you get to the tower .,1
love the rides both up and down .,1
if you 're like me and one of the few people who have not toured the eiffle tower better late than never .,1
it is very crowded so it is important to get tickets in advance .,1
"overcrowded , long ques .",1
plan for safety as it is a major area for targeting tourist .,1
be prepared for lots of people and long queues .,1
make sure to look at the tower from the streets -lrb- or sena river -rrb- around 21:00 hours to see some extra lights !!!!!,1
if you are planning on doing this make sure you pre-pay before you leave the us as the lines are very long in paris .,1
we went reasonably early on a quiet sunday in march .,1
"you have to do it , it is a thing of beauty after all .",1
if you visit paris you must and i mean must go to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
the eiffel tower is everything good that you would expect for it to be !,1
would n't rush back to see again .,1
fantastic and a must do activity if you are in paris .,1
date : 17/2/2017,1
have a coffee and admire from trocadero gardens for an uninterrupted view .,1
i have lived in paris for over 20 years and i went up for the first time today .,1
"unfortunately , the top was closed for renovation .",1
watch your purse .,1
if you are in paris you have to do the eiffel tower .,1
nonetheless it was beautiful .,1
"there were heavy security measures in the wake of the 13 november 2015 tragedy , but it did not deter people from coming .",1
i was slightly sweating with fear in the lift as its tight .,1
"up close or from afar , this is a not to be missed site in paris !",1
this is a must see check off item .,1
cafes on the way up on 1st n second floor got to warm up and have a rest .,1
even going to the toilette requires baggage scrutiny .,1
we loved the paved walkways to the tower and enjoyed the scenery all around .,1
"i have never ever been so amazed and satisfied with a tourist monument like the eiffel tower , although it was not my first visit !",1
definitely worth paying extra to go to the summit .,1
enjoy the tower from in it or nearby !,1
"we visited the eiffel tower during the day , and took the elevator to the top -lrb- too many stairs for us -rrb- and enjoyed the wonderful view over paris .",1
went to the top was amazing view .,1
"you know this monument of an attraction from books and movies and yet , when you finally see it , it still exceeds your expectations .",1
great view of all paris if the weather is nice .,1
it took maybe 15 minutes before we were on the elevator .,1
this eiffel tower is beautiful and breath taking !,1
might be better to go during the week ?,1
we visited the eifdel tower several times during the day and night .,1
the lines get long and having a reservation is really worth it .,1
i believe the fame of eiffel tower benefits from past .,1
the queues are shorter if you book in advance and print off your ticket so worth doing if you know when you 're planning to go .,1
we bought 2 glasses of champagne for 20 euros which was a bit steep but we were on holiday !!,1
unfortunately we could not go right till the top but to make up for it we took the ferris wheel at place de la concorde and got a good view of paris .,1
night time nice to see the lights .,1
the queue for the lift to the summit was only five to ten minutes long and within 25 to 30 minutes at the most we were at the top !,1
"i recommend everybody not to miss a chance to visit this city , city of love .",1
"if you wish to go somewhere , go to paris !",1
fences everywhere .,1
even if i had to walk up which is reasonable,1
easy to get to from anywhere in paris city .,1
take a cruise on the river seine where you can capture a beautiful shot before you go at night .,1
"obviously when in paris you have to see the eiffel tower , once .",1
"long line ... lunch at eiffel tower 58 , a bit scary the lift , overlooking paris is a sight to behold .",1
while we were there much construction fencing around and blocked off as the euro 16 was taking place .,1
best place to see paris from the sky .,1
"they have completely renovated the levels which is fantastic with new toilets , restaurant , café area which makes you forget that you are on the eiffel tower .",1
it is the biggest attraction in paris .,1
8 of those days were on a trafalgar bus tour starting and ending in paris .,1
having made it to paris we had to reach the top !,1
get there early for the best experience !,1
there are lots of crowds and lots of security .,1
it is beautiful even at ground level .,1
although i liked it much it was too crowded and you have to spend considerable amount of time queueing twice .,1
"all in all , a shocking service from a site that has one of the world 's most iconic structures .",1
"hard to describe it , the eiffel might seen like a hunk of metal but it is so much more it is necessary to see it to understand it .",1
next trip we will !,1
paris is very expensive and is in trouble .,1
"if only the line was more entertaining and organized , the visit would have been perfect .",1
i pre-booked my ticket online which meant i did n't have to wait in a gigantic lineup forever .,1
it was simply breathtaking .,1
recommend buying ticket online at the eiffel tower website .,1
"i was a bit intimidated at the thought of walking up all those steps in a somewhat open stairway -lrb- fear of heights -rrb- , but it did n't bother me at all .",1
it 's amazing when you reach the third level of the tower .,1
no surprise that this is the no. 1 tourist attraction in paris as it is an amazing piece of engineering and architecture .,1
itself is the paris already .,1
glad to say security was obvious and bag checks were in place if going up the tower .,1
"not that much to do when you get there and frankly , it is better from afar .",1
the eiffel tower is iconic to paris - when you think of paris you think of a few main attractions and the tower is normally one of them !,1
bought tickets for the summit which were a reasonable $ 17 .,1
"i visited 9th of may , 2016 .",1
what ´ s the problém are the crowds of people there .,1
we booked our visit through viator which allowed us to skip the line ... probably saving us an hour .,1
the young lady whose birthday we were celebrating will undoubtedly take the tale of dinner up the eiffel tower home with her when she returns to australia later this year .,1
we visited during the day and then had dinner at the ny café on rue de new york in the evening and watched the shimmering .,1
superb .,1
"i went up by stairs and only able to go two floor and not the top of tower , not sure why , quite gutted .",1
the view is beautiful .,1
we we 2nd on the elevator ... first elevator up .,1
"the tower is high , you can do the steps , but there is a lift too .",1
the inner workings of the eiffel tower at night is something to behold .,1
i was there just at sunset so found the photography really good .,1
this time we did the climb and paid for the extra mandatory lift to the top .,1
"and whilst you 're up there , why not have a croissant -lrb- yes expensive , but why not , you only live once ! -rrb-",1
what a beautiful structure this tower is .,1
lovely views of paris and definitely a must do !,1
up to the second floor .,1
not goo to go to the top on rainy or overcast days .,1
we visited the eiffel tower twice within our 4 days visit to paris !,1
we went in july last time and could n't get near the place for queues .,1
b,1
the view from the top is magnificent i was speachless when i got to the top i will totally recomend paying to get to the top and enjoy the view .,1
we visitedthe eiffel tower on a city tour during the day and went back at night to see the lights twinkle on the hour .,1
"i am sure the view from the top is very nice , but at this visit it started to rain , thunder , lightning and strong winds came up 15 minutes after we arrived .",1
"amazing view , lunch + drinks and a walk around the eiffel tower - level 1 .",1
well that was that we realized we were victims of a paris thief -lrb- stupid tourists -rrb- .,1
its magical !,1
"no words to explain the extravaganza that we feel , when you stand beneath it !",1
so much fun .,1
we went to the top and spent some time there taking pictures and enjoying the incredible view of the city .,1
on a short city break to paris - the eiffel tower was on our must see and do list .,1
the tower is not as beautiful as you would think from the ground but it does offer the most stunning view once you get on top .,1
it was the first time for the rest of my family .,1
"thoroughly enjoyed our trip up the eiffel tower at night , it made it even more magical !",1
"me and my husband visited the eiffel tower on a friday evening whilst we where in paris , we qued up for tickets and we did n't wait too long .",1
"in summer dirty and crowded , we gave up on travelling to the second level , this time on a winter rainy day , we were able to get to the second floor with very few people , it is a grand structure with an amazing history , there was no fog due to rain and we had a great view of paris from the second level .",1
we have been to the eiffel tower previously but this time we managed to get tickets to visit by night .,1
it 's fun to go up at least once in your life .,1
if you get a reservation the upper level restaurants are lovely .,1
at an average cost of $ 75 this is an option .,1
it was very nice walking along the adjacent streets .,1
at night was all it up in france 's colours .,1
the views from the top is great .,1
you will definitely want to purchase advance tickets to get bird 's eye view of this beautiful city -- advance tickets are not required but highly suggested as the walk-up line was enormous .,1
would be 5 stars but loses a star due to the annoying gypsys that walk around heckling tourists .,1
once at the 2nd floor we did queue about 20min to get to the top and the lift on the way up is not for the faint hearted but once at the top with a floor benarath you and windows around it was an amazing experience .,1
every fool trying to sell you crap you do n't want and or need .,1
the view was even more amazing on the summit !!!,1
there was a glass floor where you could see all the long lines under the tower .,1
we took pictures with it in the background daytime and night .,1
"meal after was nice , though not exceptional .",1
8pm is when the eiffel tower lights up magical !!!!,1
amazing view but inspite of on line booking very long queues n very disorganised to go right up to the top .,1
because of the crowd we chose to walk down from the second level .,1
"i recommend that you visit the top of the tower to appreciate the panoramic view of the city , but if you decide not to , you will enjoy the installations and the transparency of the first floor .",1
there 's no other word to describe it .,1
paris was our last stop in a two weeks journey of european destinations .,1
we booked a combination `` front of the line '' eiffel tower tour and seine boat cruise .,1
essential when in paris .,1
so we walked up all the way to the top to the point you can walk and saw a beautiful top view of paris .,1
there is a reason it is such an iconic symbol of love ❤,1
we loved the hustle and bustle around the eiffel tower - we booked a night tour - it was still quite busy but we were able to enjoy the views - the elevator and lineups are quite cumbersome even with the prepaid time slot - we went to the top of the summit - once back at the 2nd level we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so much more fun than the elevator,1
"though we had been before , it 's like a beacon , drawing us back each time we are here .",1
if you want to use your feet to climb -lrb- yeah !,1
the lift is good to get up there.and the views are phenomenal,1
france as to learn a lot of others country in order to preserve better its treasuries !,1
if you have an opportunity to see the eiffel tower at night it is magical .,1
the walking tour was good !,1
"get a ticket to the top as well , it 's beautiful up there !",1
you have to queue to get from the second floor to the top this takes about 30mins .,1
"very good value for money , only 5 euros to take the stairs .",1
"lovely landmark but long q do not bother to take second floor or more unless you have enough strength to climb all those stairs , at night it is a must see especially the 5 minutes shimmering",1
it is recommended to book the entrnace in advance because there is a very long queue otherwise .,1
the tower itself is beautiful and even more spectacular at night with the light show .,1
we loved it and counted ourselves lucky to have been passing by at that time .,1
great leg workout !,1
make sure you revisit on the hour from 9pm to 12am for a sparkly light show .,1
we purchased a ticket to the summit of the eiffel tower in advance but found ourselves in very long queues on the second floor .,1
definitely book your tickets in advance .,1
"make sure you buy a ticket in advance , or else the lines are very long .",1
we had an awesome dinner at restaurant 58 tour eiffel .,1
i traveled to paris in december and my tour director took us straight to the eiffel .,1
you can use the stairs for around $ 7 or take the lift for more -lrb- sorry ca n't remember how much that was -rrb-,1
truly lovely.no wonder it is such a recognized structure world-wide .,1
"i remember climbing the eiffel a couple of years ago ; as i got to the top after what seemed like forever , i took a giant leap of faith and down i went into a conveniently placed bale of hay .",1
they closed the stairs on the evening that we visited as it was raining .,1
in paris there is love in the air paris is famous for love and effile so must go to see it .,1
"when the lights came on , it was magical to be part of something so iconic ... yet it was so peaceful and lovely .",1
we enjoyed our time at the eiffel tower .,1
we felt like we had it all to ourselves .,1
we paid the entrance to climb the stairs as the queue for the elevator was crazy long .,1
nice perspective to see at night .,1
the view from the top floor amazing .,1
"we were fortunate to view it up close on the ground , from the river aboard a sight seeing boat and from several other tall structures around the city .",1
the ticket helped us get past a ton of lines to get to the second level .,1
did n't go up but it is simply beautiful .,1
carl - we can not hold up a tour when you 're late .,1
our entire family just had the best time from the excitement of walking up to it to walking down the stairs at the end of our visit .,1
"despite the crowds and cold , it is an engineering feat and a great attraction .",1
"if you go in winter months , save money and do n't buy the `` skip the line '' pass unless you have to .",1
not cared at all ...,1
the dinner was very nice in the restaurant on the 2nd level and early enough to allow time for exploration up the tower .,1
also ... .,1
we had a trip to the very top and was worth every penny .,1
the views from the top is excellent .,1
"the eliminates the long line of buying tickets , you go straight to the lift line and the wait is much shorter .",1
there is a reason why it 's loved by so many people .,1
"years ago made a trip to the top , which was truly amazing and breathtaking views .",1
"it 's the eiffel tower , probably most people 's `` must-see '' in paris !",1
looked around then went to top .,1
we went back around ten pm .,1
but watch for african souvenir sellers and eastern european women with clipboards asking if you speak english .,1
quite an expensive activity but worthwhile .,1
climb the stairs rather than taking the lift you can enjoy the views the whole way up .,1
scary experience but worth it .,1
there were too many people up there by then so it was a bit crowded in that confined space .,1
"all were friendly , helpful , and courteous .",1
do not be afraid to come here .,1
it was truly amazing and a must see when your in paris !,1
"it was still good though , to see the city after dark .",1
"the eiffel tower is impressive at any time , but make sure you see it at night when it is lit up .",1
lots of rude people queuing .,1
wish i could be here for new years one day .,1
one of the most famous monuments in the world and seeing it up close is a lifetime experience .,1
"once i got on to the elevator and the to the next level , things got bad .",1
this tower of about 300 m height is made of steel with no screws .,1
we chose one with a guide for the eiffel tower 10am tour and tickets to louvre and boat which we could do in our own time during the day .,1
the chaos outside the towers is disgusting .,1
went with friends on a saturday night in august .,1
"once we had viewed paris from all sides , we went back down .",1
it is worth the trip .,1
we went around 10am expecting mad queues .,1
"after seeing replicas of the eiffel tower in other cities , we were surprised to see how big the real tower is .",1
"this is a must see and that is commonly known , but something that is n't is the advantages of climbing it via the stairs .",1
we were unable to climb the tower as the line was very long .,1
it sparkles at night after 10pm .,1
eiffel tower in paris is one of the wonders of modern technology .,1
"i think the eiffel tower is beautiful and amazing , from a distance !",1
they have a new ' 1st ' level floor with the glass flooring so you can see underneath and it is marvelous !,1
that is something they could improve on !,1
we went up to second floor for the views and decided to eat a snack at deli ; good ham sandwiches .,1
it 's pretty cold outside at the top of the tower and you have a small champagne bar there -lrb- at the top -rrb- you can see the entire city from the top and it 's just a spectacular view .,1
we went in may when the sun sets around 10 pm .,1
"views from up there are amazing , no matter where you look to the view are just lovely .",1
this is the best way to see paris .,1
"i have always wanted to do the eiffel tower , but the waits are usually very long .",1
"well organized , polite staff and good value .",1
"the first level has a restaurant , concessions , restrooms and a gift shop .",1
the sparkling lights come on at the top of the hour for about 5 minutes .,1
"once we went up to the second deck , we were on our own and the ride to the summit was on our own .",1
this queue was shorter than the queue for the lift and moved quicker too .,1
only 5 minutes worth but omg !,1
good times !,1
"really glad we did , as the line to buy tickets was long , and then the line to enter the tower was even longer .",1
"it 's truly beautiful , day or night .",1
be careful with pick pocketers and head closer to the royal palace for a better picture !,1
best time to see the tour eiffel is about 19:30 with the light effects .,1
view from the top is amazing !!,1
we took uber from our hotel and we were lucky to get there on the hour just in time to view the twinkling lights on the tower that lasts for 5-minutes only .,1
#beware barry,1
the eiffel tower is one of the true landmarks of paris .,1
awesome all the same .,1
"my partner and i had tickets to the top , unfortunately this was closed due to high winds but we did get to go to the 2nd floor , very high .",1
as expected it was very busy with tourists and the queues were crazy !,1
"always incredible to look at and hear about , views from all floors are fantastic .",1
extraordinary structure and wish i had more time .,1
expect long lines and many opportunities to buy trinkets .,1
it is worth booking a ticket on line in advance as that saved a long time in a queue .,1
"i would go right up to the base of the eiffel tower , take the ubiquitous selfie pic from the ground level , then go across the street and take a boat ride on the seine instead of going to the top of the eiffel tower .",1
once on second floor u have to buy another ticket through which u can go to the summit by a lift .,1
"this is the must go place while in paris , you need to buy tickets online or can buy the same at the counters .",1
and enjoy full city view ... you can buy souvenirs there .,1
spectacular view incredible construction and probably unique situation with such a tall building in europe .,1
"it 's huge , seems way out of place where its located but when you see it up close , you feel patriotic whether or not you 're french .",1
we went in the evening as it was getting dark .,1
a must do experience .,1
book a tour as you will be waiting ages for the lift .,1
as not a great fan of heights and with a ring in my pocket i was so nervous i proposed at the bottom of the tower luckily she said yes otherwise that may have been awkward !,1
the ticket booth for summit was closed and no one tells you whether it will or what time it opens again .,1
extra of course !,1
beautiful to see in person - stunning light show .,1
it is a scary ride but part of the experience !,1
truly a masterpiece .,1
"even though we first saw the eiffel tower about five years ago , it was still stunning .",1
you can never miss the eiffel when in paris !,1
may skip the summit as it 's not much difference from second floor,1
"we saw notre dame , sacre coeur , luxembourg gardens and the eiffel tower .",1
"so , our party of 15 met at the pier for the river seine cruise at 7:30 p.m. in time for the sunset .",1
this amazing icon of paris is not to be missed .,1
eiffel tower was the most beautiful i found .,1
it pays to have pre-paid tickets to avoid the long waiting queues .,1
i always take the stairs in the eiffel tower .,1
you will be treated with 5 star service and food .,1
we spent an afternoon visiting the eiffel tower ; we booked with viator who arranged a great guide who spoke very good english and was very knowlegeable of all the sites that could be seen around the tower ; the package included a quick way up the first lift .,1
i was disappointed that their was so much garbage around,1
truly worth the effort,1
what a place it is ... two completely different views of day and night so do n't miss any and yes there is one more view to be seen at every hour of night when sparkling lights come for 5 minutes .,1
"personally , i love the eiffel tower even more from a slight distance away .",1
it was sad to see food wrappers and empty cans being thrown and left on the ground .,1
beautiful tower and worth the visit but be prepared for vendors and tourists everywhere,1
a huge working erector set .,1
we did n't go all the way up to the second floor .,1
if you buy the ticket online a day before than you do n't have to wait as long so please buy online .,1
the eiffel tower was completely wonderful at sunset .,1
the lines to get are enormous but you can buy the tickets online at home and book the hour and day to go up,1
"try to book a ticket online ,",1
we did not ascend the tower as we had fantastic views of the paris skyline which included the eiffel tower from various locations .,1
this has been on mine and my 13 yr olds bucket list for a long time .,1
i highly recommend for all but the most acrophobic !,1
there are total 669 stairs -lrb- one way -rrb- .,1
ease transportation and accommodation available .,1
me and my husband went both day and night .,1
there is a souvenir shop for fun .,1
even got to see the light show which was an added bonus .,1
long queues .,1
"then if you want go to the top , just purchase ticket at the 2nd level booth .",1
was a nice way to spend an hour in the afternoon .,1
we arrived just before sunset .,1
"staff were so friendly and nice , i 'd go back on a nicer day when it 's sunny -lrb- book in advance -rrb- it was foggy when we were there , but the sun shined from the elevator assistants face , she was so chatty and full of helpful tips for the rest of our trip !",1
"wish we had known drinking in public was much more socially acceptable in france , because , everyone was drinking .",1
you can either walk back down or take the free elevator .,1
absolutely breath taking and as we had dreamed of .,1
"though very busy since it was during christmas holidays , long waiting .",1
you can get on and let it do the rest .,1
absolutely brilliant .,1
several coffee shops and places to eat near by .,1
paris looks beautiful from the top of eiffel .,1
everyone must visit the eiffel tower built in 1889 for the world 's fair .,1
great place to take a picture .,1
this was our second visit to the eiffel tower so we knew what to expect .,1
"it 's obviously a beautiful and iconic place , and definitely worths the visit .",1
fast track tickets included guided tour in second floor .,1
we spent a few hours enjoying the different platforms and taking in the beautiful views .,1
the views of course are great .,1
well organized to get all people moving .,1
outside views was fantastic .,1
there is a champagne bar at the top 13 eur a glass a little pricey but we were on honeymoon so was worth it .,1
too much trash on the street .,1
we went during the day but night would probably be more spectacular .,1
"if you want to have that same experience , i highly recommend that you dress in business casual or even `` fashionable '' clothing when you visit .",1
when it is lit up at night it is just beautiful and you can never get lost .,1
we went in the late afternoon so we got to see the sunset which was lovely .,1
"history , heaps and heaps of steel , what 's not to like .",1
finished off on the grass at trocadero to watch the light show !,1
we returned at 11am on monday 29th august and realised that there seemed to be no obvious signs of queuing .,1
champagne at the top is decadent and expensive at 17 euro for a glass of mumm 's french champagne .,1
the elevator to the very top is an additional fee .,1
probably got stuck in the euro 2016 i hope .,1
how could you not come here ?!,1
eiffel tower has been high on my bucket list of places ever since my childhood .,1
definitely get the summit passes to gain the full experience and stop on the first floor when coming back down -lrb- glass floor and garden area to see there -rrb- .,1
apparently it 's booked until 2 weeks forward so .,1
"if you want a view of paris , go to tuilieries and hop on the ferris wheel .",1
"while our lunch was a little overrated for the price , it was worth it overall for expedited access up the tower and a lovely view .",1
the first time we only got to the second viewing platform .,1
"this is my first trip visit paris , not very exciting to visit eiffel but need to know which the famous place in the city .",1
the weather was perfect .,1
there was a queue building at the security gate between n and w legs .,1
we purchased advanced reservations for the evening -lrb- 10pm -rrb- and the crowds were so much smaller than we had expected .,1
obviously an amazing attraction .,1
i 'd recommend for others that want to get a birds eye view of paris .,1
"it is more than iconic , it is best scene from the tip top !",1
"it was crowded , but eventually we made it up .",1
i had 2 very upset boys .,1
we went in the evening so got to take pictures when it was light out and got some nice ones when the tower was lit up .,1
"plan to be there at sunset to be able to see the city of lights , light up .",1
the next was the security guard at the base of the tower and the elevator operator .,1
"security if tight , which is good giving the context .",1
"i know the eiffel tower does n't excite many , but i was absolutely riddled with excitement when i saw the tower for the very first time in person .",1
and you just ca n't come to paris and not visit .,1
you should definitely try to see it at night as well .,1
they are getting ready for euro2016 so stages are being set up around .,1
"stunningly beautiful , wonderful trip to paris .",1
it '' s a world famous structure .,1
we were on an avalon river cruise and went with a guide .,1
despite not being a busy day due to weather it was still very crowded on the second tier of the eiffel .,1
"after the hugging and high fives , we had a look around the city .",1
one should not miss watching the tower during the night .,1
would definitely recommend seeing this .,1
views are absolutely stunning !,1
we took the optional tour of `` behind the scenes ' would highly recommended this tour as it also gives your priority entry - skip the queues .,1
visiting the eiffel tower and experiencing that view from the top are an absolute must when in paris .,1
the fact that we were visiting an icon for a one-time experience gave us the adrenaline to make it through .,1
the weather changed quickly from overcast to cold/windy/rainy so we curtailed our summit visit but still enjoyed the sights from the waiting rooms and other floors .,1
visiting eiffel tower was an experience in itself.the blinking lights which come up for 5 min every hour in the evening are mesmerizing.needless to say it is a must see spot.in the evening when the lights come up and eiffel tower becomes visible from various parts of the city and even from the river cruise it looks beautiful.paris is a very romantic city and eiffel tower is a beautiful land mark,1
looking at the eiffel lighting up and listening to good music .,1
"planning your visit , in advance , is the only way to view the entire city of paris from the top of the eiffel tower .",1
very beautiful but the long queue to go up is not suitable for elderly because you have to wait long time standing until you buy the tickets then you have to wait again to get in the elevator .,1
best views are from the 2nd floor and if i visited again i wouldnt go any higher .,1
easy .,1
took the family up to the second level for the views .,1
"a visit to paris would n't be complete without a trip to its most famous monument , even if you do n't go up it !",1
ca n't not be impressed with this magnificent structure !,1
"we chose the last slot , 2130 hrs , this is the last slot during summers , the ticket was valid to the summit , and costs 17 euros each .",1
"however , you will feel awesome if you are going up to the top of tower and see the brilliant view of paris .",1
this was surely my highlight of the holiday !,1
here is also the center of city with many other famous places to go .,1
august 2014 was our actual visit but i never got around to posting a review .,1
"no doubt , the eiffel tower is a must-see of paris .",1
i strongly recommend finding a vantage point from a distance to the see the light show at night .,1
"beware of all the hawkers trying to sell you cheap souvenirs and the guys playing tricks on the sidewalk , you could lose a lot of money if you 're not careful .",1
"fantastic views of paris , and the unique possibility to admire the engineering genius of gustave eiffel .",1
thats my tip to you .,1
"i wanted to get champagne to drink at the top , but i thought it was too expensive .",1
made the mistake of taking the stairs my first time and i got so dizzy !,1
we just browse outside for about 5 minutes after lunch .,1
"we headed directly to the green counter , as per instruction on our ticket .",1
"this is my favorite tourist attraction in the whole world , simple as that !!!",1
definitely a must see in paris !,1
it would help .,1
"amazing , beautiful views of paris from the top even on a foggy day .",1
the top is even more dramatic .,1
always a great attraction to visit the worlds most famous tower .,1
bring lots of water and be prepared to do a lots of walking .,1
if it 's too cold you can stay at the cube up .,1
one needs to visit it to see and feel the real thrill .,1
buy your tickets on-line in advance to avoid long lines .,1
"we met the tour guide about a block away from the eiffel tower-seemed sketchy , but it was n't .",1
the eiffel tower is lovely however i experienced it from a different perspective .,1
"many seats to sit in the park and have a picnic lunch , restrooms near by as well .",1
must be seen .,1
only 5euro for people aged 12-24 years old and 7euro for older!amazing prices !!,1
"this trip , i was very impressed with the guide that my friend hired as well as the efficiency with which the elevators performed .",1
simply fantastic and breathtaking !,1
i 've been in paris in april 2015 with my wife .,1
the whole fun n joy is gone because of the long wait .,1
enjoyed the 600 + steps and the views of paris .,1
the downside of it that you might be queuing for sometime to buy the ticket and then to take the elevator up and down .,1
"first of all , it is an engineering wonder .",1
"so a little bit disappointed and hearing terror stories of hours waiting in line , my wife and i decided to wait and see .",1
they have thought of everything to make it easy for everyone to experience this wonderful attraction .,1
the guide was very knowledgable the view was exceptional !,1
we sat underneath the eiffel tower eating icecream and watched the pickpockets .,1
lots of pickpockets about !,1
my first advice would be to book tickets online before you head to paris .,1
it is one of the most amazing things ever .,1
we did the eiffel tower tour with city wonders -lrb- http://www.citywonders.com/en/france/paris/paris-tours/eiffel-tower-top-summit-tour -rrb- .,1
very nice view on eiffel tower !,1
"climbing the tower was not very challenging , but the elevator is very interesting .",1
thankfully with no queues we were able to climb the tower without booking and enjoy the views .,1
of course a must see when in paris !,1
the night light show was spectacular .,1
the atmosphere is lovely and the surrounding areas are really pretty .,1
"at night , even more stunning .",1
a definate visit .,1
gets extremely busy as you would expect and the queues can be horrendous .,1
it was the perfect night .,1
they paired perfectly with each course .,1
now i have to bring my wife .,1
this is a must see trip .,1
"the eiffel tower is a wonderful place to visit , views are fantastic .",1
"beautiful cant ignore the giant tower the kids love it , try at least once to go on top of the tower , the view is breathtaking .",1
it is a very beautiful piece of construction .,1
short walk to the entry point where we skipped the line for the first security search .,1
"another advantage : queues are shorter , the later you go , -lrb- because all those with kids have to go home !! -rrb-",1
we decided to eat lunch at the tower restaurant .,1
"we went there late evening on a cold tuesday in mid-january so while we did n't have any lines getting into the general viewing area , i did still see bunch of people lined up waiting to go inside - so if you want to up , definitely book in advance even in the off-season .",1
"the lines to get to the summit were very long , but worth the wait !!",1
"eiffel tower is one of must see attraction but be prepare for couple of hours queuing , pushing and squeezing specially in lift area on the way down .",1
"let me start by saying this was our first trip to paris -lrb- my mom and i -rrb- and we booked a `` skip the line '' eiffel tower tour the day before through the concierge at our hotel -lrb- hilton paris opera -rrb- , which cost 130 euros total for 2 people .",1
view is spectacular !,1
eiffel tower at night and arc de triomphe in the day -- that is what i 'm telling people .,1
it was so much better than we would have expected !,1
"during the day , at sunset , and dont forget to see it at night with the sparkly lights !",1
"when you get done doing whatever you went there for in the first place , you exit thru a turnstile .",1
buy tickets on-line !!,1
avoid the mobs of tourists by walking along the quay . . . trust me .,1
"however , given that the eiffel tower is one of the most iconic things in the world , when in paris - you go to the eiffel tower .",1
goes without saying - spectacular views !,1
the area directly upon the tower is very hectic .,1
"we waited far too long for 2nd story access , but so worth it .",1
one can only imagine how such a mammoth structure would have been created so many years back .,1
go there even if you do n't plan on paying to go up the tower .,1
be prepared for a lot of security checks .,1
long lines but fast track ticket was good .,1
as a engineer it was amazing to see but my friend who is n't still agrees .,1
fabulous atmosphere go both day and night .,1
"i have been to paris numerous times , but this last visit , we went to the eiffel late at night , when there were no more crowds , and it was quiet .",1
that 's when the view is at its best and when the city truly comes to life .,1
i start when hundreds of others trying to work selfie sticks in front of it .,1
we visited on sunday and as expected it was busy .,1
"pictures and movies , do not do this attraction justice .",1
a view not to be missed .,1
"we went there twice , at daylight and night .",1
daylight then sunset and dusk all in one visit !,1
it was my fantastic and remarkable experience of life .,1
there are two carrousels that kids love to ride .,1
"going up the eiffel tower was my daughter 's one request for our paris vacation , so i bought tickets online ahead of time .",1
"at trocadero you have a beautiful view , and can walk down the stairs/hill to the tower past some really beautiful fountains -lrb- if they are working -rrb- .",1
"or skip the top , enjoy the view from 2nd level .",1
"when you get to the top , there is café / restaurant where you can rest and enjoy some foods/drinks .",1
did not end up making it to the top .,1
it 's easy to do & not particularly expensive .,1
luv the see through floor on the lift to the top !!!,1
we have purchased tickets for 2:00 pm .,1
we did viator 's -lrb- www.viator.com -rrb- skip the line : eiffel tower tour and summit access and we highly recommend it as an excellent way to see the eiffel tower - it 's certainly worth ascending to the summit as it affords an excellent 360 degree view over the city .,1
we had tickets to visit the eiffel tower on july 11th .,1
the eiffel tower must be seen to be believed .,1
pre-book your tickets online so you can bypass the majority of the queue .,1
its really as magical as they say it is .,1
would n't have changed anything about our eiffel tower experience .,1
do n't be afraid to stand in the line to get to la tour eifel .,1
which did change our impression of the tower but it 's still not to be missed .,1
my husband chose the 6 course meal and i chose the 5 course meal.we chose the 6 wine pairings .,1
the second floor views are actually better since it was un obstructed with no metal wire protection .,1
"so , we stuck around for the tour with our guide and learned some fun facts about the eiffel tower and paris .",1
when they say 5pm its 5pm not a minute before .,1
it is beautiful !,1
who can go to paris and not go to the eifflel tower .,1
"we went toward sunrise and stood in line for 45 minutes , then in line again for the elevator to the first landing , then in line again for the summit elevator .",1
"i had already been to the tour eiffel during the day , however i must admit that going there at night was a completely different experience .",1
washroom facilities availability and cleanliness good with security on the door .,1
it was still crowded up there but i imagine a lot less crowded than during the day .,1
we were part of an eiffel tower by night tour .,1
such a beautiful area .,1
"it 's the eiffel tower , just go .",1
a great place to visit for both young and old ...,1
we highly recommend purchasing a reservation to the eiffel tower as you will save a lot of time by bypassing the walk up line .,1
getting to the top can be a whole-day journey so plan accordingly !,1
so we obviously had to visit the effiel tower while in paris .,1
it 's beautiful day and night .,1
we could n't find any online tickets for the summit therefore we prefered to waited and bought our tickets from gates .,1
as always in busy tourist areas beware of pick pockets .,1
only travek snobs go to paris without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
but we do not feel we missed being impressed by the sheer scale and grandeur of this iconic monument .,1
loved the experience .,1
they do it every hour for about 5 minutes after dark .,1
"once you get to the top , the view is fabulous , although from the lowers levels it is just average .",1
"if you want amazing pictures of this iconic structure , the stairs are the way to go !",1
and avoid the extremly annoying sellers on your way from the metro ...,1
we went one evening at 9pm and the tower began to sparkle at the strike of 9pm .,1
"for those not keen on heights ... try and go to the top , there is plenty of space so you dont have to go to near the edge ... .",1
"i was truly excited exploring the eiffel tower in spite of the fact that the experience starts from waiting in a long , long line even in december .",1
absolutely free .,1
so the food turn out good and the service is good too .,1
when darkness fell and the tower lit up and then sparkled it was breathtakingly beautiful.i would love to return one day and if in paris this should definitely not be missed .,1
"really great experience went to the top view was fantastic , and a toilet at the top .",1
the glass lifts offer a grand view over the astonishing architecture of this monument .,1
i went around and see it from all sides .,1
definitely a must go experience .,1
views are amazing and the rides up and down to the various levels are very nice .,1
i would suggest that you book online before travelling though as the queues are exceptionally long .,1
stop at the first level also .,1
we arrived at the eiffel tower at about 3 o'clock the line was very large for the elevator but there was hardly a line for the stairs so we chose to climb the 700 stairs needed to get to the second floor .,1
which is an extra 8 euro each .,1
but first we went down !!!,1
we were then on our own to enjoy the 2nd floor and make our way down at our leisure .,1
it cost 11 euro per person to go up with the elevator .,1
"we took pleasure in going up to the level two , every step up we savoured the history and looked by very close distance to the details of this extraordinary building .",1
must visit and live the iconic status .,1
it obviously is quint essential paris and worth an up close visit .,1
i love this trip me and my partner has a lovely time here !,1
it was busy but only a 45 min wait to get in .,1
a memory you will cherish for the rest of your life !,1
"arrive at allocated time on ticket , batches of people are let forward as lifts up to summit levels have limited capacity .",1
it is so much bigger in real life and such a beautiful experience that was .,1
see it by day and see it by night .,1
you ca n't miss seeing the eiffel but i could n't imagine waiting in that line .,1
evening just before the sun sets would be a good time .,1
you could see all of paris all lite up .,1
the place was still quite crowded .,1
"the process was very easy , and printed my tickets right after purchase .",1
"there are refreshments , toilets and a lovely restaurant on the first level and then refreshments and a gift shop on the second .",1
then you line up first to get the ticket then to o up then to come down .,1
my favourite place on earth x,1
we walked up to the 2nd level of the eiffle .,1
"a photo from the base of eiffel tower it will not be so beautiful , in my opinion .",1
"wonderful experience , of course !",1
to our amazement there were only about 20 people lined up so we decided to head to the top .,1
you can stay up as long as you want and the history and views are pretty cool .,1
"you must visit during the day , then at night to fully appreciate .",1
pick a entre which says only stairs .,1
"going there a bit earlier is also nice because for the first half hour or so , the crowd is not too bad yet , so you feel like you have to place to yourself .",1
"from the top , it took as about 30 minutes to descend using the two lifts and to get to a good vantage point on the champs du mar to view the spectacle .",1
"we decided to climb the stairs -lrb- there was a shorter line , and i think it was cheaper -rrb- , and i can only recommend you to do the same !",1
the eiffel tower is of course the iconic paris landmark .,1
"no words can describe it , amazing .",1
incredible views and very romantic !,1
heavy security for obvious reasons .,1
there did seem to be some more security than normal to just even walk under it .,1
the eiffel tower is certainly a most-visit site when in paris .,1
over 2 hours queue to get to the elevator .,1
everything around the tower looks very temporary .,1
i actually walked passed the eiffel tower during the day and it was an eye sore .,1
... it 's a lot bigger than i imagined .,1
we went at night and saw it lit up .,1
"take the elevator or the stairs -lrb- see through metal mesh , fresh air , views , shorter lines -rrb- - both ways are lovely .",1
recommend the people can go at day time & night time respectively to take photos,1
you can buy champagne at the top and gifts and rolls ect on first floor .,1
it was beautiful as always and a must see !,1
the queues were massive and it took about two hours to get right to the top but it was so worth it !,1
the view especially for louvre museum is nice but i may prefer seeing eiffel but not climbing to it .,1
"i have been to the top level at sunset and stood underneath before the barricades ... both are amazing views , but the picture below was taken in the rain and i would stand in the rain any day to see this iconic landmark like this again",1
visiting paris at the end of september meant we missed the worst of the crowds of tourists -lrb- we were also advised that the tourist numbers were down 40 % because of the terrorist scare -rrb- - lots of security checks in and around the tower which was reassuring but even so there are lines of people waiting .,1
amazing overviews .,1
great place to visit with your family and friends .,1
very is great .,1
we have in egypt cairo tower i love tower evil every thing in paris wonderful and beauty,1
make sure you hit the champagne bar at the top .,1
many photo opportunities around city .,1
of course everyone must at least go once and go up to the top .,1
we visited the mechanical portion under the tower and learned about how the elevators work .,1
we went to the second level and then accessed a level right above that .,1
made it so much easier .,1
if you do want to go up i heard a person say that getting tickets on line will help you avoid the long queue to get tickets to get into it .,1
it 's our second visit at effiel tower .,1
a nice time to go is just on dusk .,1
a bonus was that the eiffel tower started flashing and blinking at the top of each hour .,1
lots of security definitely safe .,1
we 're young and it was n't really a problem .,1
since the awful terrorist attack last year the eiffel tower has been enclosed with chain link fence and security up the yang wang ... which was great !!,1
"we were lucky and walked right in , no wait !",1
especially at night when the lights start to flash .,1
at all high street/end shops by private security .,1
a bit foggy when we arrived - could n't see the top of the tower .,1
came down and bought a few fun trinkets at the gift shop and left .,1
go early .,1
an engineering marvel it 's a must see despite the lines .,1
the tower is one of the most impressive monuments i have ever seen .,1
it lights up at night and i love that is rustic and is worth the trip .,1
queues were not bad at all on a weekday at the end of september .,1
security is a pain but in this day and age there is nothing you can do about it .,1
on the site you can not buy tickets for the evening .,1
you can not beat the views from near the top .,1
book early for tickets as they are hard to buy when you 're already there .,1
"it is a great place to visit , lots of atmosphere , but if you do n't have a lot of time in paris , there are much more impressive things to see this beautiful city .",1
"it was our daughters 16th birthday and all she ever wanted was to go on top of the eiffel tower , ever since she was younger and always said if i ever go to paris , i want to go to the very top .",1
give yourself a couple hours because of lines and waits to get from 2nd to 3rd .,1
"other than that , enjoy !",1
"nothing like enjoying love in paris , and nothing more iconic than the tower .",1
"it was so romantic place , doing nothing but looking at it and talking with your friends or lover will be also great and make you happy enough !",1
"if you are of a reasonable fitness , climb the steps .",1
i wished they give you a ride down as well .,1
months later my 4 year olds are still talking about going up the eiffel tower !!,1
"we ate at the restaurant which again had superb views , the food was okay , but not sure i would choose to eat there again .",1
i would highly recommend palace of versailles instead !,1
"with wonderful baguette sandwiches in hand , we ate our lunch and observed the tower .",1
this is a really beautiful tower built almost 150 years ago,1
"surprisingly , there was not a great crowd .",1
"price is high , but its totally worth it .",1
was so delighted we did that as the ques were mental .,1
the tower itself was a great visit .,1
beware of pickpockets - we came very close to one and feel lucky we did n't fall victim .,1
they have upped security in the area and you are now unable to walk under the tower without first going through security gates .,1
whole idea of skip the line tour was to save time not to go on a tour that would take longer .,1
"the kids loved the tour , the only hassle being the wait to catch the first lift .",1
we visited smack in the middle of euro cup 2016 .,1
useful to take rest .,1
it really is a beautiful structure .,1
the tower is gorgeous by night with fireworks etc. .,1
you can get a glass of champagne at the top .,1
"the second floor had a great view as well , the first floor was beautiful !",1
we visited the eiffel tower in the middle of the euro 2016 football tournament when security was extremely high .,1
however our guide did not wait to make sure we were able to go to the top so we missed out .,1
"we heard a lot about pickpockets there , but were careful and had no issues .",1
i prefer during the night with all the lights !,1
it is bigger and grander than expected !,1
though the elevator was full due to the upcoming euro 2016 celebration they closed the three pillars and only the west pillar was the only elevator open for that day but still we managed to have our lunch at 58 restaurant at the top .,1
going to second level of eiffel tower is must do thing who goes there .,1
just do n't waste too much time .,1
definitely see it during the day and at night when it lights up and glitters !,1
torre eiffel é demais !,1
"it was a great experience , especially as we were able to skip the line and had a great tour guide .",1
"the climb to just the 1st floor was n't easy - i think since it was toward the end of the trip , my legs were just ready to be done - and the continuing climb to the 2nd floor was even more difficult , but at both floors , there 's plenty of room to sit and leisurely walk around and get food .",1
the view of paris never gets old and always impresses !,1
"the stairs are easy enough to climb if you take your time - there is no rush , just enjoy the views !",1
it 's not a very tough walk -lrb- we did it with a 1yr old baby while carrying stroller & bags -rrb- .,1
"i made amazing pictures in one visit ... its is really windy out there so be prepared , they will constantly alert you about pocket pickers .",1
we were to leave paris the next morning .,1
but has to be done .,1
what were you even thinking ?,1
we were lucky to see the tower lighting up exactly at midnight ... it was a sight that made us look up in awe .,1
think of paris and you think the eiffel tower .,1
it 's a classic yet i totally suggest you to make your first visit during the night .,1
"as long as you have reasonable health , try walking up the tower .",1
plan to spend lots of time in line at each platform to get on an elevator as they only hold about 20 people and the lines can get up to 45 minutes long .,1
"we visited the eiffel tower twice , but did n't dare go up ; the lines were long and it was a bit chilly ; the eiffel tower is magnificent especially when it lights up on the hour for 5 minutes ... .",1
make sure you take lots of pics .,1
"as the symbol of paris , the eiffel tower is a must , the price is relatively cheap if you are willing to walk and there are two levels which is great .",1
"having always wanted to go the eiffel tower i was so excited to get to go , and the views did not disappoint .",1
the only let down was the queue .,1
another great experience in paris .,1
"the lines to use the elevators can take some time , hence it is advisable to keep 2 hours minimum for the visit .",1
tower is best viewed from arc de triomphe,1
would recommend to anyone .,1
the second time we went to lunch on the first floor then took the stairs to the second level - not an arduous climb with wonderful views on the way up - can make you a bit dizzy if you go too fast .,1
"to avoid lines , book early online ... and enjoy the view !",1
we visited on the easter long weekend of '09 and the queues to go up & then again upto the 3rd level were too long .,1
book your ticket on internet to avoid the queue !,1
here are numerous ways to get tickets :,1
do not save your money by just going upto 2nd or 1st levels .,1
take the elevator !,1
there were no lines .,1
you have to see it and experience the feeling .,1
we came for the new year and loved it .,1
"this is a must visit attraction for anyone visiting paris , you will regret if you did n't .",1
"no long q due to cold , best trip ever",1
"at night , the building lighted up beautifully , you could see it miles away .",1
live life on purpose !,1
before too long we were in the lift .,1
"after about 750 steps , you are at the second level .",1
at night they had most of the central grassy area blocked off .,1
"of course you have a souvenir shop , which sky high prices .",1
i even laid on the glass floor which was a bit scary but so daring !,1
"the tower and park are much , much larger than brochures portray .",1
enjoyed returning in the evening to see the tower lit up at night .,1
light show is just for 15 mins and it is every hour from 8pm -lrb- not sure about 8pm -rrb- .,1
welcome to the best ever selfie zone ! -rrb- -rrb-,1
if your level of fitness is not good there are lifts .,1
try & / see at sunset or take the lift to the top .,1
we had a skip the line ticket so we got right in .,1
wonderful way to spend our honeymoon .,1
online booking needs improvement .,1
"we had the kitschy champagne at the top , and our kids said they loved watching us toast up there -lrb- ohh , the innocence -rrb- .",1
"it 's everything you 've read , seen and heard about so enjoy the experience .",1
even the tickets to the 2nd level were sold out !,1
night time reveals a twinkling of lights all over the structure .,1
i did n't go right to the top as it was an extra 45 minutes to go up .,1
"even from the outside , it is a very impressive structure , both during the day and at night .",1
it is a magnificent structure when standing underneath .,1
the illumination tour of paris is very beautiful .,1
the day was beautiful and the view was incredible ...,1
great time climbing the tower and taking in the views from all sides of the tower .,1
it 's been there done that kind of attraction .,1
then again to buy tickets .,1
the eiffel tower was such a awesome experience for me !,1
no bogus commissions thanks for the tip !,1
we did n't purchase the ticket in advance which is a big mistake .,1
we spent lots of time on each level .,1
beautiful views both at day and night .,1
but the area around and beneath leaves a lot to be desired .,1
the eiffel tower ... just a tower .,1
we did the night bus tour which was excellent.there is great light show in the evening every half hour.during the day a good place to take boat trips from,1
got the dying sunlight and then the sunset and the gradual lighting up of the cityscape .,1
there is a small ice rink on the 2nd level and the skate rental is free !,1
what a beautiful piece of art .,1
the only advise is to be careful of the criminals and film flam people that hang around the tower .,1
you have to visit during daytime and at nighttime so that you see its beauty with and without lights .,1
"and once you 're up there , the view was definitely worth it !",1
the twinkling lights that run at the top of the hour after dusk for five minutes are mesmerizing !,1
book to get an elevator to the top well in advance of your trip though as the queue can be up to 2 hours long !,1
the line was n't too long -lrb- we did n't buy advanced tickets -rrb- .,1
"unfortunately , it was closed due to a strike by staff .",1
how do i know all this because me and my fiancee got scammed out of a 100 euros i got it back maybe not from the guy that took it but from another scammer but anyway be careful just walk away .,1
so where whisked through the crowds .,1
just awesome went for supper there highly recommend .,1
it was 7 euro per person to walk .,1
now for my own opinion on actually going up the tower .,1
we had an escorted tour which was great as we were able to avoid the queues and go straight to the lift .,1
the guide was loaded with information !,1
we had a tour scheduled and it was easy and not overly busy .,1
it was awesome to just stand and take it in .,1
one can not go to paris without being mesmerised by the eiffel tower,1
they go on at the top of the hour for five minutes .,1
"while others waited for hours on the endless line , we met our guide , went to the underground bunker and heard about the history of the building of the tower and how it became a broadcast station ... then we passed the line again , went directly to the second floor where we were allowed into an area on top of the restaurant to take pictures without hordes of people around us .",1
"for all the times you 've `` seen '' the eiffel tower in movies or print , it 's truly amazing to see it in person .",1
but the view is well worth the wait and hassle of getting up the tower .,1
"it 's huge , and an amazing feat of engineering , especially when considered how old it is .",1
"no visit to paris would be complete without a trip to the top of the eiffel tower , once the worlds tallest structure with views of paris unmatched anywhere .",1
i had the pleasure of seeing the eiffel tower during the clearest of days in addition to seeing it sparkling against the night sky .,1
lots of great shots from the bridge and from the other side as well .,1
the views of paris are brilliant .,1
if you will count the people which are visiting the eifel tower you can be sure this is no. 1 in paris for all of them .,1
the nighttime views are beautiful and the lines tend to dwindle down then and not be so bad .,1
"we had bought a paris pass , so took an evening seine cruise , and returned just as the lights on the tower began twinkling .",1
"other than watch your wallet/hold onto your purse and go early or late -lrb- the lights are really stunning -rrb- , my one piece of advice is to approach it from across the river up on trocadero park where the views are far better than up close -lrb- there 's a trocadero metro stop that 's right there -rrb- .",1
we had our 6 yr old daughter and 12 year son and both enjoyed the ride up .,1
nice overall .,1
it was my 3 teenagers first visit to paris and the one thing they all wanted to do !,1
just amazing must do whether scared of heights or not .,1
eiffel tower was great to see day and night .,1
always wanted to visit here and i was not let down at all .,1
our second time to the eiffel tower .,1
i would probably say to do this once and once only .,1
"and once you get up there , the view is as stunning as you would hope .",1
"once we were let inside , there was no one in the cue for the stairs and we went straight through -lrb- i did n't look at the one for the elevator but i do n't think it would have been too long at that time -rrb- .",1
they did a great job !,1
expect long queues to go up the tower without advance purchase tickets .,1
"the restaurant area on the 1st floor is great , but you really do have to go to the summit .",1
deffo recommend you go,1
"unfortunately eifel & surrounding area was shut down due to 75,000 people protest on the day we had booked to have dinner at eifel , as well as a cruise & moulin rouge show .",1
mom was happy just the sameand we got some great pictures .,1
what a spectacular tower .,1
i went at dusk and was able to watch the lights come on across the city .,1
"we wanted the exercise so we took the stairs up as far as we could , then took the elevator up to the top .",1
iconic and lovely and easy to get all mushy sentimental about .,1
it lights up at night and pretty much defines the paris skyline .,1
i was waiting for sunset to happen .,1
we came to paris for the eiffel tower .,1
we went close up in the noon .,1
then another 30 mins for the second lift .,1
we did eat at the 58 hour restaurant .,1
"the most fantastic iconic building , it did n't disappoint .",1
great views and easy to get up using the lift .,1
in the beginning we were a bit reluctant to wait in the line to go at the top but it worth it .,1
"even on a rainy day , we went all the way up to the summit and boy was it amazing !",1
one can see all of paris .,1
the lines to go to the top were too big .,1
"read some history , enjoyed the view and people watching .",1
"the tower is simply breathtaking and nearby parks make it very convenient to take a walk after , have a seat and drink a cafe or wine .",1
one of the most recognisable structures in the world is truly amazing up close .,1
we did wait about 1 hour to get up but well worth it .,1
get in early to catch an early spot and beat the crowd !,1
"we had the premier seating , it was expensive 180 euros per person but it was really worth .",1
queues for food quite a wait at lunch time .,1
it 's lovely to have a picnic in the park beneath .,1
"as a little girl , i always wanted to visit and see this wonderful view .",1
"amazing service , view , and delicious meal .",1
"look , if you are in paris you must see and experience the eiffel tower .",1
we were able to enjoy the relative solitude .,1
you can buy your ticket to go to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
have a champagne toast at the top and go all the way to the top !,1
very beautiful and the photos will be very nice .,1
one off the bucket list,1
"just an fyi do not put your guard down , watch your surroundings at all times !!!",1
"get your tickets online to avoid the lines on the day of your visit , as online tickets give you direct entry , it is essential to carry a photo id proof , just in case you need to present it .",1
looks nice at night too !,1
hard to imagine just how big it is until you are at it 's feet .,1
a trip up the eiffel tower is a must when visiting paris .,1
we went to the famed eiffel tower in the evening .,1
"not cheap , but had to be done !",1
got disgusted waiting in long line for the tickets and passing through tight security checks .,1
"we saw the tower with an air of caution , to be sure , and that put a little damper on our relaxed mood ; we were on high alert .",1
"there are better city views from the top floor of the montparnasse tower , and it cheaper and less chaotic .",1
we read that it was not worth the visit and the view was not as great at the eiffel tower compared to others but we absolutely loved it !,1
i did n't see or experience any pick pockets but be careful in any large city .,1
there 's heaps of places nearby where you can pick up excellent picnic supplies .,1
eiffel tower is one of the best places to visit in the world .,1
"i went up after dark , and it was enchanting to see the whole city lit up , with the river winding through the middle .",1
what a spectacular place .,1
so unless you are scared of heights it is a must see !,1
there 's also a long queue to the lifts to take you to the summit .,1
bought skip the line ticket which was the best move .,1
not much shelter from the rain .,1
the line for pre booked tickets had about 20 people in it - nuff said .,1
it will be a big help .,1
i visited the eiffel tower in august 2015 but bought my ticket from the official office online .,1
here are a few tips ;,1
the transport system was pretty good to and from the place .,1
we only went to the second floor but the views of the city from there re impressive .,1
i recommend just viewing it from a short distance and spending that time in the louvre .,1
"booked a guided tour from our hotel , and took my six year old daughter to the summit .",1
spectacular landmark .,1
the views are fantastic .,1
visiting the eiffel tower is not much of a surprise because it 's one of the most famous structures in the world .,1
i recommend climbing to the first deck and then onto the second deck .,1
everything went fine but we had to carry our stroller with us whole time and it was bit difficult and annoying .,1
or the green line to bir hakeim station .,1
nice view and obviously a unique place to be .,1
"for something visited by so many people for so many years it is still in excellent condition , very clean , very safe and another must do when in paris",1
if you are looking to cool off or just relax after walking to the eiffel tower - this park is a saviour .,1
as you might expect there are a lot of tourists near the eiffel tower .,1
steel structure .,1
"i can recommend the eiffel tower , on a fine day the view from the top is fabulous across paris , like a map below .",1
we couldnt visit the levels due to time constraint however i must admit that eiffel tower looks absolutely stunning at night .,1
once ticket purchased queued again and was appalled at rudeness of other visitors que jumping .,1
"amazing structure , fun ride up , unbelievable views .",1
make sure you buy a skim the line ticket with access to the very top where mr eiffel had a tiny apartment that thomas edison visited .,1
"after thoroughly looking around , we decided to wait a while until it became dark to see the city 's lights come on .",1
the views of paris from the top are unforgettable however be prepared to wait in long lines .,1
did we enjoyed it ?,1
this tower is so huge !!,1
the best is to go on the top of arc du triomphe to admire it .,1
and then the lights on the tower start to sparkle .,1
the tower is enjoyed better from afar .,1
we enjoyed looking at the tower and getting ice cream from the little stands .,1
"we were told we could buy tickets to the third level once we got to the second level , but when we got there the machine was broken .",1
"i have a crippling fear of heights but managed to push myself to go up , i did however , just make it to the second floor and could n't go any further .",1
"first time in a paris , of course i needed to visit the eiffel tower .",1
of interest was the number of high rise buildings starting to appear around the city .,1
the eiffel tower is known for being tall .,1
"as we visited eiffel in winter , we did n't have to wait too long for the elevator .",1
security is high around the tower at present so leave plenty of time for numerous bag checks etc. .,1
"we love paris , and always revisit favourite places , last week we spent some time at the eiffel tower , and were sad to see all the security you have to go through since our last visit , its no longer fun to walk around the area and in the park area behind the tower.i understand all the security but it spoilt it for us a bit",1
we got there just before dark to see it in the light and dark .,1
its gorgeous .,1
"this was not a first time in paris for us and in the past we had already visited the eiffel tower , but it always represents a fascinating spectacle , at least for us .",1
overall was an amazing experience and my son loved it .,1
bring your lunch !,1
it 's funny when you finally get to see the eiffel tower -- there 's a sense of disbelief .,1
"we could only go to the second floor but it was worth every penny , the views were just spectacular .",1
"expect to queue to get close to the tower , to go up , or even just to walk under it .",1
never fails to raise my pulse !,1
yes i know you must do it but it is not worst it to wait so long ... .,1
the lights at night are wonderful .,1
"nowadays , they have plenty of security lo over the place , but this is a great experience .",1
been to paris several times but never taken the time to visit the top of the tower .,1
i think it is on an hourly basis after 8 in the evening .,1
as you expect the views are amazing and well worth every penny .,1
"there are crowds so be careful of your belongings , although our group was fine .",1
"if you want to see the city of paris then you should go to the top of the eiffel tower during the daytime , but if you want to see the eiffel tower in of itself then you should go at night .",1
wonderful viewed from below .,1
properly access your physical condition before you attempt the stairs .,1
"i 'm not sure when we 'll visit paris again , but whenever we do , we will certainly make another eiffel tower visit , that is for sure !",1
"make sure that you arrive early , and if you plan on going to the top make sure to buy tickets online as soon as possible !!",1
ca n't begin to imagine how bad the experience would have been if we tried it on a saturday afternoon .,1
"it 's a must see in paris , and you can even go up to the observation deck if you would like ... just make sure to come early , as the lines get long !",1
a lot more security now then the last time 5 years ago .,1
good shops & eateries up there too .,1
this massive structure is the most exciting thing to see .,1
very busy and lots of queuing .,1
"really worth seeing in person , a great wonder of its generation just amazing only drawback is the bold hecklers who lurk there , avoid any conversation with them .",1
love it ... wonderful .,1
it is so worth the time it takes to get to the very top .,1
security was very tight around the eiffel tour .,1
it is something that if you 're in paris you simply ca n't miss .,1
it 's like walking on air and you will remember it always .,1
it certainly felt like it too .,1
if you 're reading this review .,1
i felt safe .,1
the tower and the story behind it are amazing .,1
i chose the elevator although the waiting time was almost an hour because i was too tired to climb up the stairs .,1
i admit thus was not on my to-fo list ... but so glad we went up .,1
it is the place that defines paris,1
enjoy the surrounding gardens and neighborhood and be sure to talk with the other people around you .,1
"on my 2nd visit , i went to the first level .",1
i saw nelly furtado perform under it which was incredible .,1
it is magnificent and iconic .,1
the eiffel tower is impressive and it 's hard to imagine how large it is until you see it in person .,1
"just do it , you will be glad you did and every time you see the tower in movies you will remember you did .",1
do plan to see the beauty in day light and night time .,1
"this time was different , we got there on a wednesday and there was almost no waiting time to go up .",1
everyone usually takes the lift upto the second or third -lrb- top of the tower -rrb- level .,1
there is another ticket to visit until second floor .,1
the park at the foot of the tower is prefect for picnic .,1
make sure to grab a crepe too !,1
you can take the elevator down .,1
i have waited a long time to see this awesome structure and it was beautiful to see .,1
from there you can buy a ticket for the elevator to the top .,1
the night view of the tower is stunning !,1
just to stand under it is marvelous.then to see it light up at night .,1
absolouty loved it .,1
it 's an obvious attraction and should n't be missed .,1
we purchased tickets in advance -lrb- a must ! -rrb-,1
also visited the catacombs & notre dame !,1
"we booked a summit ticket in advance , but this probably only saved us about 10 minutes queuing time , you go through a separate entrance but then blended into the impenetrable crowd , then get shuffled along until you come back down to earth .",1
our photos from this vantage point were not very sharp due to the angle of the sun .,1
i recommend taking the steps when it is warm out because the experience is quite fun .,1
"arriving from the trocadero metro stop gives you time to appreciate the tower as you walked toward it , although other stops are closer .",1
"very windy once you got up top , but the mrs was very happy , and i felt good too",1
the climb was exhilarating .,1
"during my stay in paris , i did a great deal of sight-seeing and of course , the eiffel tower was one of the places i had to see .",1
"paris is stunning from up here , well worth the trip .",1
"visited in february , so no any lines to wait .",1
stare at it .,1
walk up !,1
after that it was plain sailing .,1
"fortunately , that did not happen .",1
"i highly recommend going to the top , if you can take the height .",1
"it takes a lot of time to reach the top , but it 's very nice in the evening",1
did the trip to the top in early february but fortunately the weather was clear .,1
great architecture !,1
"surrounded by homeless beggars and then pickpockets as you get closer to the tower itself , it 's like most things french ; superficial fluff .",1
fantastic experience !!!,1
one can go up by either climbing stairs or elevator on any of the four legs .,1
restaurant took so long we had to hurry down to catch the rest of the tour with only 5 minutes on the first deck .,1
"visiting here many times whenever i travelled to paris , its a huge one we clould not miss .",1
go to the eiffel when the sun is setting .,1
both the day and evening views are good and one should see both .,1
this was a little more expensive method but we accomplished what we wanted .,1
you just have to go at the right time of the day as you can end up waiting quite a bit .,1
"do it , see it and then admire from a distance .",1
once we got to the top we could walk around and take pictures .,1
"if you go for the first time , i suggest to go from the metro station `` trocadero '' which will offer you a great view .",1
loved it and will return back .,1
we took a pedicab over to see it and it 's so much bigger than we thought !,1
definitely recommend a tour of the tower .,1
hang out on joseph bouvard road southeast of the tower for a full unobstructed view .,1
you must see the eiffel tower if for no other reason than to take the obligatory picture in front of the eiffel tower .,1
what i witnessed were kids sitting down next to a man who put his phone next to him to tie his shoe ... we alerted him and the kid just looked perplexed .,1
do n't miss seeing the tower at night .,1
the golden lights flicker and create the most beautiful site to see at night in paris .,1
"do n't take the lift , you will queue for hours .",1
make sure you 're already logged onto the site and at the page ready to go .,1
"or you can save a few euros , endure a much shorter queue , and work up a bit of sweat by taking the stairs to the 1st and 2nd floors .",1
the view does n't really change much by going all the way to top .,1
"yo can feel a lot of happines , caos and serenity at the same time even with the thousands of peiple visiting .",1
i have been up into it once and once or twice just visited from the outside .,1
one of the must visit place in the world .,1
your ticket gets you to the first teo levels .,1
but we only want to visit the eiffle tower .,1
took over an hour to get down and with children this was problematic .,1
should be free so it can move faster .,1
the view is breathtaking !,1
just be sure you can handle about 700 steps .,1
the views are simply breath taking .,1
watch out pickpockets .,1
too much tourists and uncomfortable because of thieves .,1
great photo opp .,1
my wife and i visited the eiffel tower and decided to walk up the steps !,1
"so , go with your family early , if you arrive by 8:30 am , you should n't have to wait too long .",1
we had way more fun here than we had imagined .,1
a truly iconic site of paris .,1
"be sure to pay attention may have a specific time to show up , but makes getting in and up quicker .",1
it is a tourist `` must see '' while visiting paris .,1
"so beautiful , i never knew that the tower shimmers gold and white lights at night .",1
the photos ops from the tower are outstanding !!!,1
we planned to see it the next day during the day .,1
"at night , every hour the tower will have a small light show .",1
"as great a landmark as this is , nothing describes the sensation of just looking at it .",1
"we do n't know how the weather is gon na be , so that 's the problem .",1
book online and beat the queues .,1
there were some lineups but overall wait times were okay .,1
everyone should `` do '' the eiffel tower at least once .,1
you ca n't visit paris without doing the eiffel tower .,1
definitely worth the visit .,1
since we went to paris after new years day it was relatively quiet comparatively speaking .,1
"actually up the tower is very busy and very cold , i much prefer to admire it from the ground !",1
3 level if you want to go up the tower thought this is not cheap for 40-50 minutes .,1
do go and take pictures if and see it for yourself of the magnificent structure even you do n't intend to go up .,1
it is really a amazing sight .,1
"interesting to see the way the tower was constructed , illustrated by historical photos displayed at the top level .",1
you can see far beyond the bois de bologne and vincennes .,1
it was freezing cold when we were there !,1
so magnificent .,1
one of the best places to go in the world !,1
the eiffel tower is a must see in paris especially during the evening when the lights are turned on and every hour the tower sparkles for 5 whole minutes which offers you another amazing view of the tower !!!,1
a really nice atmosphere here .,1
this was a good way since it saved us time on lines and made reservations for our lunch at tour58 the first level restaurant .,1
there is a light show every night on the hour .,1
i can not explain it .,1
the second level was better for viewing than the first ; really did n't need to go to the top .,1
"this is one of the cities which everyone should see , there is magic is every single part of it .",1
"even on a cold cloudy day when we visited , it was still certainly a magnificent sight to see .",1
also that people are n't too excited about being patient .,1
"if you can , whereever you are in the world , take a plane and get to paris to see the tower !",1
"naturally , the eiffel tower is a fanatic architectural wonder and fascinating landmark , however over the last 10 years , it really feels that it has been turned into a theme park .",1
i liked our guide too - very funny and informative regarding not only the tower but the history of paris too .,1
besides just seeing the tower from a distance it is exciting to be able to go up in the elevators to the various levels .,1
makes a nice video to post on social media .,1
"i took my husband on this famous landmark only to waste our time queuing for 3 hours in the hot sun is another thing , queuing again at the restaurant just to get water as i 'm am suffocated and dehydrated already !",1
"put off by all the reviews about queues , right ?",1
does n't cost a bomb -lrb- ard $ 17 -rrb- .,1
"bypass the people selling the souvineers , and make you way to the tower .",1
had a really lovely time here it 's a special city .,1
"however , watch out for the gypsy girls with their bogus `` petitions '' and do n't admit to being english because they will hound you for a `` donation '' ; ignore the hawkers with their shoddy souvenirs ; and beware of pickpockets .",1
"at nights the tower is so beautiful , the lights are wow !!!!",1
did n't feel any need to travel up to viewing galleries .,1
oh and toilets are at the base and each floor should one need to go .,1
took the elevator up and walked down for the experience .,1
"best place to view the tower is from trocadero , i think .",1
this shop also has gelato etc. .,1
"as such , the no nonsense security detail was stern and unwelcoming .",1
"my kids know the eiffel tower and have seen it in countless movies , tv shows and more so i wanted to be sure they had a chance to see it in person .",1
the line on people queing to up the eiffle tower was so long that we didnt end up doing it .,1
i have to say that the main reason to go and see the eiffel tower and to say you went and saw the eiffel tower .,1
wonderful day .,1
pleas eplan properly and go as it gets busy from time to time .,1
loads of police around so felt safe .,1
it was really good time all day in the eiffel tower but night was exceptional !,1
"if you want to visit the top , make sure it 's open -lrb- go online to check -rrb- .",1
"the eiffel tower is a very popular attraction in paris ; however , it is loveliest at night when the lights are shining .",1
"pity , as i enjoyed the journey but it left a bad taste and my 10 year only niece was quite scared",1
maybe next visit we will try it out .,1
"everything is easier to see from the second floor , but the top , summit , gives a complete paris perspective .",1
we then saw the eiffel tower all lit up at night from the ground .,1
now my third visit it is still breath taking especially at night .,1
if you want to go up in the tower for goodness sake order your skip the line tickets on tripadvisor before you go or you will be in line for hours .,1
"when you 're in paris , you have to see the eiffel tower , right ?",1
"spectacular during the day , it truly comes alive at night , with a dazzling light show .",1
the most famous place to visit in france .,1
moon was up .,1
paris looked superb .,1
from palais de chaillot / jardins du trocadero you have a wonderful view on the eiffel tower .,1
"come and see it , snap some photos and then hit the metro to go to another part of town where there is more to do .",1
walking to the top - well that did n't happen but we walked from mid way down .,1
"had tried booking tickets online before travelling , but could n't get any availability .",1
beautiful tower and a fun experience to have .,1
"so yes , quite afraid of heights .",1
"i was quite underwhelmed by my visit ... on the other hand , this visit was my travel awakening - something about the eiffel tower that makes it land on everyones bucket list .",1
first let me said the front of the tower its not as described .,1
the first time i wanted to see the eiffel tower was at night with all the sparkles - and that 's what we got .,1
went straight to the top .,1
there is nothing more impressive than the eiffel tower and all it 's glory !,1
it 's beautiful scenery .,1
"i would highly suggest signing up for part of a tour group and making sure they have this same privilege , thus saving you the half day of line standing that come on the busier days .",1
i booked a tour through viator which allowed us to skip the long entrance lines .,1
i was fearless and went to the top sky deck ... absolutely incredible and i am so glad i went to the top !,1
just be careful of your valuables just like any other busy tourist destination through out the world a little care and common sense .,1
"take all the pictures from the top floor , and then take your time with the 2nd and 1st floors .",1
it 's not .,1
"we were at the second level and said let 's walk down the stairs , hence the title .",1
our ticket 's access is until 2nd floor .,1
even more beautiful when the sparkling dazzling lights lit up the tower at every hour of the night .,1
we went once during the day and twice a night .,1
it has to be done in paris !,1
or do you prefer to call it breathtaking ?,1
"surely they can process access a lot quicker , open all the towers to access the top .",1
granted we couldnt have champagne at the top doing it this way but we got to see it and experience it with a minimum of crowd and not many street vendors trying to get us to buy dodgy toys .,1
"beautiful views from the top of the eiffel tower , quite a few facilities in the eiffel tower including ice skating and restaurants .",1
the beacon light at the top was sometimes obscured because of the fog but the fog only added an air of drama to the tower .,1
"we loved visiting the open grassy area below , walking up the stairs of the tower to the platform where you have a very nice view and are not always mobbed by other tourists .",1
"we just visited and walked around , we were pested by many street vendors here , one of the only places we were in paris .",1
"however , its still a must to take a closer look at it .",1
is it really that amazing and mesmerizing ?,1
"the tower sparkles on the hour , every hour , which is why i would recommend a night time visit .",1
superb structure and stunning views from the top.the restaurant charges very high and even the gift items we saw was quiet expensive when compared to other part of the city .,1
daytime and nighttime .,1
"also , ensure you allow enough time to view the tower from the ground during the evening as the light show running every hour , on the hour starting at 8.00 pm is worth the effort .",1
"you have to watch out for pickpockets and obnoxious street venders , but avoiding them it is truly a once in a lifetime view .",1
gorgeous views and awesome structure !,1
every structural element is bolted .,1
"we spent here couple of hours with a skip the line tour , and stayed a bit more by ourselves .",1
although this did afford us a picture post card first view of the tower from a typical parisian street as we approached it .,1
my best picture however was from trocadéro on the hill at night .,1
massive bit of advice wrap up was a warm day when we went but at the top like the north pole .,1
never tire of coming back .,1
lovely early mornings .,1
marvellous structure .,1
or just bring a blanket and wine and sit in the park right in front of the tower amongst many other tourist and enjoy the twinkle and excitement .,1
"but , if you manage to go up , the view was wow .",1
visited solo to tick off my list of places to see .,1
the skip the line was worthy !,1
"it was very breezy as we went on to the higher floors , even in july so come prepared !",1
"this , to me , was the beauty of this most famous structure .",1
do not miss to have a cruise in river seine .,1
i have visited many times .,1
"lots of vendors , so watch your wallet !!",1
i will surely comeback here after 3 years .,1
each time presented the most spectacular views of one of my favourite cities in the world !,1
it 's even more amazing at night and the lighting show is priceless ... we did not experince any problems with pick pockets or any other forms of crime .,1
it also offers a good spot for selfies !,1
do not miss .,1
it 's worth the investment and waiting .,1
"unfortunately no panel showing us what we were looking at from the top though , breath taking views .",1
"we did not have to wait in the long lines , we just entered and started our tour .",1
there 's a gift shop on the second level for your official eiffel tower souvenirs .,1
the lights are beautiful and every so often it will sparkle with a glitter show .,1
going up the tower is great and specially at night the lighting effect is great too .,1
"bring some warm clothes , because it is windy , waiting in line for the elevator .",1
once inside there are numerous confusing long lines .,1
can see all the way across paris .,1
"i could n't keep track of the amount of times people would come and ask to sign a petition , try and show a trick -lrb- that results in you giving them money -rrb- , sell some sort or tour or just flat out ask for money .",1
hope i can visit this area in the afternoon with my family and friends .,1
but a pity that if you buy a stair ticket then you have to walk all the way to the 2nd stage .,1
and stunning at night !!!,1
its really a wonder of the world ... we went upto the final level of tower and its amazing .,1
they sell champagne at the top for 18 euros for a tiny cup .,1
"i would say the day we went , it was closed so you ca n't climb up to see the view .",1
just make sure to bring a gold camera to get good quality shots .,1
just fabulous .,1
"it may not be that new , but it is new since the last time i was in paris .",1
"it 's amazing during the day and at night with all the light works and the big light on top of it , but after midnight all of the lights are gone and the tower just looks sad and soooooo depressing .",1
i would definitely recommend everyone to go to the top of eiffel tower at least once to capture the beauty of paris .,1
more in the restaurant .,1
"unless you 're willing to wait in line , you do n't get a whole lot more out of seeing it up close than you do from seeing it from miles away .",1
you need to wait in the row maybe 20 min before you get to the elevator - even you have a ticket for a set time .,1
nothing can prepare you for the staggering size and the beauty of form !,1
"of course if you go to paris , you must see the eiffel tower .",1
there are bag searches when you go in .,1
plan on at least 90 minutes if you want to go the top and back .,1
"big deal its just an old radio mast with lights on it , guarded by the army for tourist safety , id stay away .",1
"after some research into `` hacking '' the visit , i arrived a full hour before the opening , and the line was already long .",1
the operator runs it like a monopoly -lrb- which it is -rrb- and has no incentive to have good customer service - as is evidenced by the out of date website ... i am not a happy customer .,1
they should be proud .,1
only downside is the length of time spent queuing for the lift to the very top but that is to be expected anyway .,1
be prepared to wait in queues and go through security screening but the wait is worth it .,1
be aware there are several levels were you can view .,1
i 'm glad i went but i will remember paris by many other things first .,1
kept bags closed and in front of us .,1
"we only went to the 2nd floor and it is actually high enough for most visitors , but you can go to the top if you are more adventurous .",1
instead me and my 6 year old walked the stairs up .,1
you can stop sometimes to appreciate the city .,1
"in the metro , in the railways in every corner !",1
"it was beautiful and if you can time it right , you can see it from the river .",1
it definitely attracts a lot of people because it 's a symbol of paris and very famous .,1
had to wait nearly 3 hours to ascend eiffel tower beautiful day so everyone wanted to do it well worth it,1
"amazing experience , its a must , fantastic views :-rrb- only had a 40 min wait it was well worth it though , we went to the second level , really was surprised how cheap it was .",1
will be back again soon,1
the show is 5minutes every hour on the hour an easily view from a nearby bridge .,1
our visit took us 2 to 3 hours more than half the time is waiting in the lines .,1
but it 's a must see place,1
"even though we had tickets in advance and were able to skip the initial line , the lines for the lift were very long .",1
the tower itself is a must visit if you happen to come to paris .,1
"we went here , and it was nice .",1
as breath taking every time you see it as the first .,1
"if i had known , i would definitely have booked my tickets on line beforehand but the queues on the day looked worse than they actually were .",1
"also , the monuments and museums in the city are illuminated .",1
but my friends still want to look around .,1
so if you can make a reservation online head of time so you can avoid the lines .,1
wait till you see it sparkles around 10pm in the night time .,1
it was actually dec 2013 i visited .,1
"the symbol of paris , you must go or pass nearby and take pictures .",1
a must visit paris icon !,1
"however what they do n't tell you is the line is looooong for security and to buy a ticket , as the elevators only carry a few at a time ... although there is a separate line and entrance for those with reservations and it as going much quicker .",1
they walked us to the tower and a guide stayed with us to the observation tower .,1
staff very helpful .,1
due to rain we do n't see it clearly but it was still amazing experience and view .,1
especially if you have bought tickets in advance thinking you will avoid the lines .,1
"an pint glass of beer , however , is fine ?",1
"this allowed us to purchase tickets to visit the summit , which is the highest point on the tower that you can visit .",1
i considered getting tickets on-line to avoid the line at the tower but i passed .,1
a trip to paris is not complete without climbing the top of the eiffel and taking in the ...,1
"by all means , buy your tickets ahead of time and avoid the queue .",1
we went there anyway as that is what one goes to see in paris .,1
"there is no real organisation to the queues either so expect plenty of americans , french and spainish to try and push you out the way to the front of the queue .",1
"its a beautiful tower , stunning , and the views are amazing from the top .",1
"i would recommend getting a skip the line pass from viator , a partner of tripadvisor , and enjoy a brief history of the tower before making your way up past the lines and exploring the floors !",1
the eiffel tower is an icon recognized around the world .,1
on the other hand it 's the eiffel tower and it 's just about the coolest tourist thing in paris .,1
"me and my partner visited the eiffel tower on his birthday trip to paris , it was beautiful by day and has lovely greenery to sit for a picnic on a sunny day .",1
"it 's really cool to see it up close and find out how it 's built , but you really only need one visit to the top , even if it 's just to say you did it .",1
"only went as far as the second floor , was still able to take in the marvellous views .",1
loved loved booked this went all the way to the top a day we will never forget a must do when in paris,1
with young boy stairs are not an option .,1
i see why they have this saying .,1
time your arrival to catch the sparkling light show for 5 minutes at the top of each hour .,1
i am stunned in the beauty of the tower .,1
it 's definitely worth paying the extra money to go to the sommet .,1
we went 2 weeks ago later at night a 15 min .,1
the summit is a must-do if you are there already .,1
"at night , it showed the colors of belgium to show sympathy of belgium explosions last month",1
great views from the top and would recommend going early .,1
"i knew it would be very crowded , so i went there very early in the morning to have a chance to see paris from the top .",1
it is a world renowned site and an absolute must visit .,1
beat the queues by arriving before 10am .,1
you can walk right underneath where the size of this tower really hits home .,1
if your adventurous go to the top .,1
"we got there approx 11am , fortunately for us weather had been quite wet & windy and the queues were very short ... due to a walking impediment , & using a walking stick , i was told i would be unable to go past level 2 to the summat , i was n't the least put off by this , more relived tbh , as having acrophobia & vertigo -- heights are not my thing ... .",1
by the time we came down the lights were turned on which made for a magical evening .,1
"that is one tourist attraction no one can miss , great view of surroundings , amazing architecture .",1
easily the no. 1 attracting in paris for me .,1
is cost us 50euros .,1
food/drink is a bit expensive when you 're up the tower but it 's not unexpected .,1
we visited on a sunday morning and found there to be very large queues probably better to go on a week day .,1
the eiffel tower is a stunning piece of architecture and amazing to think it was only built to be temporary .,1
one of the highlights of my paris trip .,1
however the surrounding area is scruffy and litter ridden which is disappointing .,1
it was windy and even more colder at the top but the views are breathtaking .,1
definitely the first choice in paris if you 're interested in the view .,1
i loved waiting in the line to get my ticket and waiting to go up to the elevator !,1
if you want to go to the restaurant you will need reservations .,1
we did n't much feel like using the stairs to get back down from the tower so we used the elevator .,1
the view of the eiffel tower from the land and river are totally different .,1
beware of unscrupulous websites that claim to have tickets and availability - just use the official website only which was very good and informative .,1
you ca n't help but be drawn to it .,1
a real trademark of paris and a must visit if you are in the area !,1
an extra surprise were the added flashing lights all over the tower at various intervals which made it look even more magical !,1
we then rode to the summit .,1
very beautiful sight indeed .,1
visit gustave 's office and have a meal in the restaurants .,1
i recommend purchasing tickets in advance .,1
"it was so much fun down and down looking thru the girders , open to the elements feeling the wind !",1
"in the day , you can enter the tower itself , view the surrounding gardens , and view the tower as a massive metal structure that will blow your mind .",1
the view from the second level is actually more interesting .,1
the trip to the top is well worth it .,1
"only thing i would suggest is do n't go late at night , alot of drunk people and people selling things under the tower are very agreesive to buy something they follow you .",1
"the eiffel tower amazes from every angle ; street , underneath , and every level on the way to the pinnacle , which is breathtaking .",1
i would recommend everyone to go on top of eiffel tower by lift .,1
be careful of pick pocket and treat yourself with a cartoon drawn picture and a merguez sandwich .,1
the views from the tower are amazing and it 's not too crowded in the cooler months .,1
restaurant is little bit expensive but meals are in great taste -lrb- i do n't mention landscape :-rrb- -rrb- .,1
the only regret i had was that i did n't have time to go up next time i 'm in paris i will definitely go up and experience the views ...,1
"the eiffel tower has it 's own unique charm , a symbol of many things , it stands proud and so should we .",1
it changes with each view and it is absolutely beautiful .,1
you get an amazing view of the city .,1
i can not express the pure joy i felt standing there looking at this magnificent icon of paris .,1
saw it for the first time close up at night - majestic and awesome sight .,1
"you do not need a prviate tour for this , but you do need a `` skip the lines '' tour",1
once at the top we were greeted with a view that millions have seen but it does n't take anything away from how special this is .,1
took the elevator .,1
"we went at night , when the tower is lit up , every so often the lights would make a sparkly effect that was breathtaking .",1
... do this .,1
"in magazines , on tv , from areas around paris , but during a trip to paris this year i decided to do dedicate some time with the tower .",1
there are 2 legs for elevators and 1 for climbing by foot -lrb- stairs ... -rrb-,1
one can also reserve well in advance to avoid any line .,1
stay till after 8pm lovely .,1
"one can spot it from almost all parts of the city , but its definitely worth visiting the eiffel .",1
simply loved the experience .,1
many lines waiting for booking a ticket .,1
avoid the queues and book ahead .,1
it has some of the most stunning views of the city .,1
it moves reasonably quickly and is well worth the wait .,1
we strollled arm in arm .,1
best to arrive before 9am if you want to enjoy the summit without the crowds .,1
"flooded with visitors all over the world , suggest you get hold of your ticket before hand to avoid huge lines !",1
we did n't eat at the restaurant we were planning too maybe on our next visit .,1
"i enjoyed going up the tower , we went at night , so it was very awesome .",1
"next time , i will seat at a balcony somewhere in the evening .",1
top !,1
read first about its history and the amazing engineere who designed it : eiffel .,1
we were then led towards the elevators and left to explore the magnificent wonder of the world at our own pace .,1
"oh , and he was 15 minutes late opening up .",1
"if you go by the sheer size of the tower , there are many taller ones around the world , but still this has a special place .",1
why not trying both ?,1
you tell one `` no thank you '' and 10 more continue to approach you and ask the same thing .,1
"queues , steps , unsolicited traders but sense of achievement when you get to the top",1
"this is the place to go for any tourist in paris , be it going there during the day or at night .",1
the first night we got there we went to see it at night .,1
"if you plan on going up the tower , watch your bag and get ready to wait .",1
going at night we found so much better than going during the day .,1
and choose one which gives you a ticket right to the top !,1
"be prepared to see plenty of police and soldiers walking around , which makes it a very safe place .",1
"if you do n't mind taking stairs , you can avoid the long lines for the elevator and get to the initial observation area - which is amazing .",1
it 's just wonderful and very difficult to express in words .,1
do n't get discouraged with the ` sometimes ' long queues as it is well worth it .,1
we were only in paris for a couple of days and there was so much to see that we never got the chance of ascending the tower .,1
"be sure to book ahead - we went right in , but the line for those who had n't was extremely long .",1
eiffel has three floors and the third floor is 294 meter from earth !,1
crazy awesome to be there with my family though .,1
its exactly how i pictured it .,1
this structure never fails to amaze me .,1
what more can i say ?,1
"love the eiffel tower , no matter how many times i go to paris ... it still takes my breath away !!",1
after reading what so many wrote decide will just walk up .,1
"this is only my second visit in 20 years , but it is sad that it is not as accessible as it once was .",1
but i 'm glad i decided to stick though with it .,1
we went there on a very cold morning but it did not stop us from having a good time admiring the tower .,1
"during the day , the lines are crazy , the security situation in europe means the tower is fenced off compared to before when you could just amble all around ... sad but necessary these days .",1
we had a walk around the tower and then across the river .,1
so that 's what you expect .,1
we had a blast people-watching .,1
the tower took our breath away totally .,1
via metro champs de mars you can wander around the base and or buy a ticket to climb to the viewing platforms .,1
this is one of the best man made structures every built .,1
classic but stunning .,1
pictures do not do this piece of architecture justice .,1
the choice is yours but either way the view will not disappoint .,1
"so we end up visiting the pyramid , louvre , chateau de versailles , arc de triumph and champ de ellys ... it 's worth having it on your bucket list .",1
it was a spectacular sight and gave us a better idea of how places we wanted to see related to each other spatially .,1
we did n't pay to take the lift to the top because we wanted to do other things and we were on a budget but i 'm sure if you can handle the height then it 's totally worth it .,1
at the top especially .,1
my advice - by your ticket in advance and skip the queue .,1
up close and underneath was a complete mess !,1
absolutely worth it .,1
"we purchased our tickets , it was quite cool that day so we purchased a hot chocolate while we waited .",1
beware of the traffic !,1
also ate in the restaurant which was very nice good staff very friendly,1
five stars hands down,1
my tip is make sure you make the most of your unlimited time you have paid for .,1
"had no desire to go to the very top , but the lines to get up there were long .",1
"very busy around here , beware of pickpockets .",1
"can walk up to the first floor , but took the lift as hot day .",1
our time spent at and around the eiffel tower was a definite highlight of our time in paris .,1
"now cordoned off by heavy security with paid access to the grounds , not including getting up the tower .",1
"beautiful place , lots of people taking photos , but well worth it .",1
we took our niece to paris for her birthday .,1
you can book in advance .,1
you can also go in under the tower once you pass through a long security line .,1
"it 's just a pile of iron , as gandhi famously said , but it 's a nice pile of iron .",1
a visit at night will be probably be just as awesome though .,1
"the first level has some informative displays , a snack shop , gift shop and restaurant 58 and of course some great views of paris .",1
"the tower is a photographers dream , but it is hard to stay away from the tourist mass .",1
due to the very long queues we chose not to this time .,1
"we did the ticket where you climb the stairs to the 2nd level , then take the elevator to the top .",1
we decided to walk down the stairs as the queue for the lift back down was long .,1
it sparkles for 5 minutes at night at the top of each hour .,1
i went early in the morning - around 10 am .,1
it 's crowded however .,1
upto the second level you have the option to take the stairs or the elevator but after that to go to the topmost level you only have the option of the elevator .,1
a lot to do around too .,1
a must see and a must do !,1
i absolutely encourage everyone to visit the eiffel tower when in paris !!,1
"there are some souvenirs shops , a macaroon shop and a cafe on the 2nd floor , and there are restaurants that can be booked in advance .",1
they closed the attendance to the tower on 11 july 2016 with no notice .,1
the staff and security were extremely friendly .,1
"at sunset , the city of lights is bathed in color like no other city in the world , and there is no better place to see its beautiful sunset colors than the eiffel tower .",1
now that 's good customer service !,1
people from all over the world at one place .,1
you feel like falling in love with the place .,1
the entire tower started to twinkle with fairy lights !,1
nearly 20 years ago i came to the eiffel tower climbed the stairs to the second stage and was tired but happy with my visit .,1
i still did n't get to go the day that i wanted .,1
"swarms of tourists , massive lines , street vendors pawning all kinds of trinkets ... but you got ta go .",1
we booked this tour as we wanted to be guaranteed of a time to explore the wonderful eiffel tower and hopefully to avoid some of the lines and crowds as we were at the start of the season .,1
people were cutting in and pretending they had always been in line and it was annoying to say the least .,1
it was a drizzly afternoon so there were n't as many people crowded around the tower as i expected .,1
"but when the sun sets , oh my .",1
an absolute must when visiting paris .,1
"its construction started on january 28 , 1887 and was completed at the end of march 1889 .",1
the top has great views in all directions .,1
"great view great sights , what more can one say ?",1
and telephoto lens .,1
get your video ready !,1
arrive just before sunset so had the chance to marvel at the engineering feat in the daylight before travelling up to the top .,1
"in spring 's daytime , i can see some cherry blossoms near the eiffel tower .",1
just go visit the empire state .,1
making reservation for dinner or a meal up top lets you skip the lines .,1
the gift shoppes we pretty reasonable as well .,1
under the tower you will probably meet some disturbing gypsies .,1
"will go again , and again .",1
wrap up warm it was very cold,1
a ` must see ' .,1
"we booked our tickets 3 months in advance , and we recommend one do the same to be able to avail all the time slots .",1
"eiffel is a must do if you 're going to paris for the first time , and i really recommend to climb the tower -lrb- by stairs -rrb- if you 're healthy .",1
a certain must .,1
but it really worth it !!!,1
"there are shops , an ice skating rink and places to eat up the tower , the lifts are smooth , the exterior stair case which you can use instead of the lifts is a little daunting but has fab views .",1
"and of course at night , because ... obviously !",1
"the trickiest part however is getting up there , in which you have to be clever .",1
i ll point out say few unexpected disappointing things .,1
but be careful .,1
would recommend getting there early before the crowds but worth the time .,1
"pictures , media etc. .",1
get advance tickets if nothing else .,1
love how it lights up at night time .,1
best view is from trocadéro - uninterrupted -lrb- except for all the tourists -rrb- incredible views,1
or astonishing ?,1
incredible place to visit very romantic and with great views of all of paris .,1
"just book tickets online early , the queues are horrible",1
great clean restrooms .,1
metro - ratp - rer,1
took the stairs .,1
"we queued for about an hour , and took the elevators to the second floor and then to the summit .",1
"even if it 's the most cliché thing to do in paris , you 'd be a fool to miss out on its wonderful history and the feeling of being a part of it !",1
the ticket to the top costs 17 euro .,1
can only go by elevator to higher levels .,1
it sits on a massive paved area and the structure is exposed from all angles for great photo opportunities .,1
"the vendors were irritating , the authories discouraged purchasing from those vendors ... you can get cheap souvenirs in the latin quarters .",1
we were very happy too see and visit eiffel tower .,1
i recommend lining up at 5pm at the latest in order to make it to the top for sunset .,1
"instead of paying 40 euro for nothing , you spend 200 euro , but at least you get a much more relaxing experience , a great lunch and the rest of your day to do other things .",1
the tower 's really tall - about the same height as an 81-storey building .,1
"actually , it depends on the sort of day , you have and how important it is to you to actually be on the tower .",1
it was simply amazing .,1
"sadly , it is mostly people making themselves targets .",1
booked skip the queue tickets which we did n't need .,1
amazing construction .,1
kind of feels like something you should do .,1
i will admit the motivation for the tour was the cut to the front of the line for the elevator to the second platform .,1
some pushy people have no recognition of personal space .,1
"we loved our visit to paris , but were not fortunate enough to book tickets early enough to get to the top .",1
"now , as soon as you get your left tickets , go and get in line for the lift because it will get long very quickly !",1
"wow , its amazing to watch that steel structure standing so tall .",1
the film about the eiffel tower is excellent and shows a great perspective of the firework displays .,1
once in the day and took the elevator to the top .,1
"we were here 1 hour before opening and got to stand in 1,5 hour or so before getting to the elevator .",1
note to self : never again let my good judgement fly out the window just because i am in fact a tourist !,1
more than i ever even imagined .,1
"your trip to paris wouln ´ tbe the same without visiting the eiffel tower , the views you have from he top are breathtaking .",1
"the most memorable moment was at night , when the lit the tower for 3 min !",1
a lot has changed .,1
what i like about the experience is that my wife was the happiest person after we got the pictures from ari .,1
"count on 2-3 hours of time , a lot of which will be spent waiting in line .",1
you need to enter the tower and use them at the first level which is unacceptable .,1
its never the same in pictures .,1
made it all look super shabby .,1
but i really enjoyed the whole experience of walking up to the tower .,1
go around the back for better pictures .,1
family of 5 including 1 teenage son and 2 younger daughters .,1
this was a fantastic place to visit .,1
looks really beautiful during those 5 minutes .,1
security is at best a joke !,1
it was just a big hunk of medal and throughout the whole tour i was hoping it would fall and kill me so that the tour could end .,1
our family recently spent 5 days in paris in january 2017 .,1
"it is majestic and huge and i could not explain why such a tall piece of metal could make you feel butterflies in you stomach , seriously .",1
"you can even dislike something in paris , but all the time that you look at this tower you remember the reason why this city is somehow different from others .",1
how did they make it ! '',1
we were unbelievably lucky with the weather as the day before it had been shrouded in mist but we had the most spectacularly sunny blue sky day - fantastic weather for the time of year .,1
views are not so nice then .,1
we then took another elevator to the top !,1
it is security heaven but once you are through the barriers there are shops and te tower .,1
when in paris ...,1
just as beautiful as one could think .,1
at night the tower even looks more amazing .,1
"great at night , when a mini light show starts a few moments before each hour",1
"if you go alone , huge lineups difficult accessibility due to the fences all around the tower this summer !",1
recently seems to have additional security checks probably due to the attack on paris this year .,1
there are iconic structures different places in the world and when you get to actually see and touch them it is pretty amazing .,1
when we were travelling from the train station i first got a glimpse of it and it was like a fairy tale :-rrb- .,1
if you want to tick all the been to paris boxes then go here .,1
we do recommend doing that .,1
"i was going to pay the extra and go express , but i 'm glad i did n't .",1
this is an absolute must see .,1
we started on the highest level and were on the look-out for sacre coeur and couldn '' t find it .,1
be sure to avoid all the scam artists lurking around though .,1
we quickly headed back down where we could enjoy the space and the open air .,1
we went mad & had a flute of pink champagne at the top - for the price of what a whole bottle of champagne would have cost in a supermarket !,1
could have had better choices for gluten free meals for coeliac 's .,1
we 've been during peak tourist season .,1
too bad .,1
plan ahead and try to book your tickets online because the lines are long and the wait grows enormous if you are not there when they first open .,1
this was at 10am .,1
"we picked a restaurant from up on the tower , then managed to find it !",1
the structure itself is beautiful but the experience was marred by the crowds and the heat,1
unforgettable !,1
all in all we felt it was worth the money and time and enjoyed it completely .,1
organised by tour agency .,1
this is so touristy !,1
been there on previous trips but it 's something you need to do !,1
"schedule a tour to save time and know the french history is very interesting , the views are awesome and the construction of the tower is amazing .",1
"if you want to see the mona lisa , be sure you get there early .",1
"i thought the cost for this was really good value , especially compared to some other similar landmarks across the globe .",1
"this city needs to gat a grip on its romas , bums , pick pockets , and savages .",1
"a big hint , book the behind-the-scenes tour from it 's website as early as possible to get the date and time you desire , and you do n't have to wait in the long ticket lines .",1
i see online that you can skip the line etc for 50-70 $ but i am glad i did n't bite on that one .,1
"great view form third floor , but expensive admission .",1
we did not go to the very top and were most satisfied with our trip .,1
"we did not stop on the first level , as it appears that getting from the first level down to the ground by elevator is a very long wait , always .",1
though it was amazing ... there was no ques at all .,1
"it also was n't extremely busy st this time either which was nice , although i must say it was very windy , so make sure you wrap up !",1
by day and by night when it is lit on the hour for about 5-8 minutes -lrb- i think -rrb- starting at 10 p.m. may be useful to book tickets on-line to ride the elevators on the tower to avoid the very long lines on the day that you visit the tower .,1
unbelievably large and crowded .,1
it was an experience of a lifetime !,1
just walk around the tower - click some good pics and you are done,1
our group of 14 had a wonderful meal in the eiffel tower on the second floor restaurant .,1
once again i rode to the very top .,1
"the most spectacular view of paris , especially when the sun is setting .",1
"my friends and i did the scenic river cruise and got a chance to view the tower lite up at night , amazing to see .",1
did n't go inside ... really no need to .,1
still great views and other things such as bars and a cafe and even an ice rink .,1
my family and i went to the top which gave us a great view of the city .,1
at least the very top it totally enclosed .,1
i had zero interest in seeing the eiffel tower .,1
both were equally spectacular !,1
this attraction is definitely worth a visit no matter what you think about the height of the tower or of paris .,1
"few lines in winter , a tiny ice skating rink up in the tower -lrb- ! -rrb-",1
this is a must do in paris .,1
summer is definitely worse than winter however the view all year around is still stunning .,1
it really is worth all the hype .,1
"have dinner or lunch on the tower , remember it all your life .",1
there are always lines so be prepared .,1
"you can then go up all the way to the top once you reach to the second floor , by taking another elevator .",1
so glad we planned in advance to buy our tickets to go up to the top of the tower .,1
it has three floors - ticket to top -lrb- summit -rrb- entitles you to visit all three floors .,1
"unfortunately when we were there it was so busy , and so crowded that it did n't make for pleasant viewing .",1
it 's just beautiful at night .,1
you must visit the eiffel tower if you 're ever in paris .,1
arriving by bateau bus - highly recommended !,1
there 's no much to say that has n't already been said before .,1
there is a separate entrance to allow those who have booked a meal to jump the queue of tower-walkers .,1
"we got off at the metro stop trocadero to see the eiffel tower from slightly afar , which is better than getting off at the champ de mars tour eiffel stop .",1
the walk around the area is amazing .,1
i enjoy visiting it at any time of the day .,1
"what was once to be only a temporary structure has now become the first thing that comes to mind when one things of paris , and what a treat to see it in all its beauty , day and night .",1
we have been up the eiffel tower 3 times and i would do it again in a heart beat .,1
i signed on at 8am paris time the first day that i could and tickets that day sold out in 13 minutes .,1
this is a great orientation stop on your first day in paris .,1
advance ticket go quickly to commercial tour operators that grab them up .,1
in august that line can be several hundreds of people long .,1
it was super crowded and once i saw the lines i regretted not buying advanced tickets for lunch on the second tier of the tower .,1
i purchased exactly 90 days prior .,1
"grab a spot on the lawn outside and relax , take a stroll underneath , or grab a beverage at a nearby café and soak in life in paris .",1
"i found the tour eiffel to be an engineering and architectural masterpiece even by today 's standards and advances in engineering and materials , but felt it was best appreciated from a distance for two reasons :",1
in a nutshell .,1
really well priced .,1
"street vendors sell anything from wine , beer , water , and cigarettes .",1
suggest a visit at night for a romantic view .,1
apparently the staff do n't do shift work so this is standard .,1
"what a magnificent structure of architecture , made for no other reason than a grand sight .",1
paris was exactly as i had imagined it from books and tv .,1
this is handicap friendly .,1
we went straight through and into the lift which took us to these cons floor and then we took a second lift all the way to the top .,1
would have liked to have looked in the gift shop but it was that busy i could n't even get in !,1
"the skip the line was nice , but you do n't get to skip the line going down .",1
"though we did n't get chance to go up the tower due to large queues , it was still lovely to see in day and night , only issue is people pestering to sign forms as you walk about .",1
"the 2nd floor has food , drinks , restrooms , some seating and trinket , as well as the gorgeous views you 'd expect .",1
"paris in the light , paris at night .",1
"this was my third time in paris but first time making it to the eiffel tower , and while it 's certainly impressive , it 's not really interesting .",1
the best view is to go to trocadero where you get to see a full view of the tower .,1
"never went up it , but have seen it up close , from far away and at night twinkling on the hour .",1
we bought a ticket to the summit of the eiffel tower at getyourguide .,1
"be warned , at the base of the tower i was pressured into buying a rose for myself !",1
go for it,1
no heart in managing the massive inflow of tourists - neither on the process of entry nor at the restaurant on the 1st floor .,1
there 's plenty of shops in the tour from where u can buy anything from chocolate shaped like the tour to key rings !,1
my favorite part was seeing the twinkling lights on the tower .,1
"a moment we both wo n't forget , just magical !",1
there were queues for the top level and we did n't have too much time .,1
it only lasts for 5m .,1
close to metro and shopping .,1
fantastic to visit the city 's most iconic structure and marvel at the engineering involved to build this back in 1890,1
-lrb- visited october 2015 -rrb-,1
as could be expected great views fun experience went to the top floor and had champagne lovely experience brilliant photos,1
"city wonders made entry and getting around much easier , as well as the informed , funny tour guide gave us a lot more information than i 'd ever had .",1
"when it 's a good exercise going up and down the 330 steps -lrb- yes , i counted -rrb- ?",1
we never miss it with each visit .,1
"amazing pictures , amazing architecture !",1
i tried to buy tickets about a month prior to our trip and the online tickets were sold out with the first ones being available approximately 2 months after our trip .,1
the eiffel tower is prettier to look at while walking around it then going up it .,1
it was so pretty all lit up .,1
only one lady serving on a saturday so slow queues .,1
"this is a must see when in paris , how far up you go is your choice .",1
no wait to go up into the tower .,1
-lrb- still ca n't believe it ! -rrb-,1
it is a beautiful structure it is amazing with all the time that past since it was build how the maintain so pure !,1
"overall , we had a great time exploring this beautiful monument and highly recommend it .",1
"the eiffel tower is also a stop along that route -lrb- the company name is bato bus , if i recall correctly -rrb- .",1
"it was awful - crowded , street sellers hassling you and the gypsies hanging around trying their scams .",1
no queue whatsoever ... but what can be said that has n't been said before ?,1
buy your ticket online and save a ton of time !,1
we did not enjoy our vacation .,1
laugh and drink ... .,1
"the first time i was in a solo trip in 2013 , and this time i brought my parents in 2016 .",1
i honestly do n't think i can find the right words to truly convey just how incredible the eiffel tower is .,1
make sure to go during the day and keep your items zipped up and do n't flash nice jewelry and things .,1
"this meant we did n't have to queue to get in the tower , which saved a lot of time , but we still had to queue to access the summit , which took a while thanks to throngs of people wanting to do the same as us .",1
i did n't go up this time .,1
have fun .,1
the tower sparkles for 5 minutes at the top of every hour and it is beautiful .,1
the eiffel tower never stales .,1
very disappointing .,1
when i do go i try to go at night not too long before it closes .,1
then we went to the top of the tower .,1
"there was a very long line that i stood on , but do n't worry it will move fast .",1
"some recommendations : buy a timed ticket on line , bring a bottle of water , go to the restroom before you go .",1
we were able to view the second floor and then purchased tickets to the top .,1
the upper floor was closed as there was just so many people .,1
looking up at the tower from the floor costs nothing and from her you can admire the work that must have gone into building it .,1
in addition tried to be there late in the day because it 's really nice to see the sun setting over paris or descending order paris from this location .,1
but this was all that was left when we tried to book .,1
it 's such an incredible view and surprising as you can see how the city is laid out .,1
i think it goes without saying that you must visit the eiffel tower while in paris .,1
would definitely come back .,1
the views even from the 1st level are amazing .,1
"you can have something to eat , drink or just to snack .",1
"i would recommend anyone and everyone to visit the eiffel tower , its one of the wonders of the world !!!",1
"the ticket prices are fairly reasonable , although i myself only went to the second floor .",1
the answer is pretty damned bad .,1
it truly is a masterpiece and massive !,1
sunny day recommend for sure .,1
"i like to go in the late evening so i can see it in daylight , then covered in lights as the sun goes down .",1
"on the top , the view is breathtaking !!!!",1
we reached the summit in half an hour and it was worth it kids below six have reduced fair and for adults it 's 16 - 20 `` euros not sure of the exact amount but it was a lovely experience .,1
far to crowded with no crowd control !,1
eiffel tower is definitely one of the place you must see in life !,1
"whne you think of paris , you think about eiffel tower .",1
"i feel silly writing a review about the eiffel tower , as it 's one of those momuments on most people 's bucket list .",1
"while the view from the second floor is nice , i recommend splurging and going all the way to the top .",1
you have the option of going all the way up to the top or staying on the second level .,1
you can even buy champagne up there !,1
there are windows all around and the climb was steady and calm .,1
there are many operators some only do the inner circle historical loop of paris others will have several lines that you can go on .,1
an iconic site that gives you goose numbs on approach .,1
"at the top of every hour , the lights twinkle for a brief time .",1
"-lrb- to reach the summit , you will need a ` summit pass ' obtained at ground level only .",1
"it was a surprice for me , how exciting this place is .",1
great view - glad we did it .,1
"so we went up the eiffel tower on a foggy , misty thursday .",1
the best way to enjoy is to view from the city .,1
the lights start twinkling by the hour till 10pm or even later in the summer time .,1
will say the souveneirs are def cheaper away from the tower,1
"straight up on the lift to level 2 , amazing views if i opened my eyes .",1
recommend going early to avoid long queues .,1
"but at night , it comes alive .",1
everything under the tower glows .,1
the sandwich booth on the right after entering down at the tower is fantastic must try,1
we had to wait in line .,1
evening lights on the tower are fabulous .,1
"good decision , the stair route had no wait and the line for the lift was about 30 minutes .",1
"lines are long , but it must be done.the night time visit this time could n't be beat .",1
i have a slight fear of heights so the glass floor on the first level was pretty freightening .,1
please note if you have a problem with walking you are not allowed to go to the top of the tower which was disappointing for me as i walk with a crutch and was told i could n't go beyond level two as if the top lift ailed there was 1000 + steps to come back down so the did n't allow it .,1
"we went up the eiffel tower at night , as we had already seen views in daytime from the arc de triomphe and sacre coeur .",1
well worth the price of admission .,1
we went there twice .,1
"the food nearby is great , the boat cruises are nearby and of course the main course , the eiffel tower .",1
what a monument ... what a city view !!,1
dinner on the second level was one of the highlights of the trip .,1
the view is awesome from up there .,1
my dream destination .,1
viewing the tower from different vantage points via the tour buses was enjoyable .,1
the views are amazing but the queues are busy and a lot of people pushing .,1
tickets were not available unless you purchased through a private 3rd party .,1
we left the tickets too late to book direct with the website but ending up buying them through city wonders which included skip the line and a cruise on the river .,1
you have to be there to experience it .,1
they sell out early so book them as soon as you plan your trip .,1
day or night - paris would not be the same without the eiffel tower .,1
"i 'm gon na be a little emotional here : when i first see the madam , tears filled my eyes - i wanted to see her for so long !",1
we are told by friends that the experience is very worthwhile if you have a special occasion to commemorate .,1
then they ask you to read something for them .,1
i did n't want to queue .,1
"we had visited the eiffel tower the previous evening to watch the sparkling lights -lrb- fun to experience with the large crowds -rrb- , then we returned the next day to walk the steps to the second level .",1
if you want a tip .,1
but boy was it worth it !,1
we also shopped .,1
there are little shops when you get off .,1
it will always be an architectural delight .,1
there are many tourists around and there was even dancers doing dances to ballroom music which gave it a nice touch .,1
i blame myself .,1
"we had about a 45 min wait at about 8pm to go to the top , however half way through the que , the top was not available , not sure why .",1
"wonderful experience , beautiful views from the top !",1
but with booking,1
children will love the carousel on the ground level .,1
"if you want to visit , book ahead or visit early .",1
"he was informative , amusing and entertaining with knowledge of his subject and an interest in people .",1
"we had previously visited and been up during the day , so decided on this visit to see it by night - we did n't go up , but it looked amazing lit up - then at 10pm they put on the twinkling lights - it was amazing !",1
"we booked our visit via ta sister company , which had the added benefit of no waiting in line and a guide to tell us what we were looking at .",1
better to book ticket online to save time,1
pre-book but you will still have to queue but it is worth it .,1
we chose to walk the 600 steps to the second level and then rode the elevator to the top .,1
i 'm trying to be romantic but there 's joe schmo over here invading my space .,1
spectacular when lit up at night .,1
on the 2nd floor you can buy food and drinks .,1
i mean really far in advance .,1
"we booked skip the line tour and it was well worth it , make sure to be on the second floor at nightfall , gorgeous !",1
then we took the stairs to the 1st floor and there is a restaurant there but unfortunately closes at 4 and reopens at 6 so we were n't able to visit it :-lrb- .,1
had lunch at the restaurant up there and was surprised by a nice bonus during the winter time -- free ice skating rink on the first floor of the tower .,1
"i have always found the best views in paris include the eiffel tower , so by climbing it , you miss out -lrb- contrary to the views of those who were living when it was new ! -rrb-",1
"if you are able to take the stairs and visit be fore 6:00 when they close them , you will save yourself a lot of time waiting in line .",1
i really enjoyed even outside of the tower and took some nice pics !,1
what a memorable way to bring in the new year !,1
"however , i wish i had not paid extra $ to buy the nighttime tickets , as the lights on the strip come on by 5pm during winter .",1
and the surrounding gardens and buildings are equally astounding .,1
"romantic , fun , and mesmerizing !",1
"such an iconic part of paris , would be a shame to not go and have a look .",1
great scenery with lovely panoramic paris architecture .,1
the best of all is when clock ticks 12 and tower glitter .,1
it can get quite windy so dress in warm clothes .,1
we take binoculars along .,1
"it was windy and foggy , but did n't stop us from enjoying the views , we had a wonderful time !",1
"standing in front of or on top of the eiffel tower , as one of the world wonders , is a marvellous experience .",1
same day i could see the eiffel tower `` well lit '' from all the above mentioned places and angles.i also had the chance to see this unique tower under rain the same day .,1
be careful of pickpockets .,1
as for the lights of the tower i reccomend the 6 o'clock seine dinner cruise the lights come on while your having dinner and it beautiful from the river .,1
our first visit we attended a dinner at the eiffel 58 and this time decided to take the tour to the top .,1
it gets pretty windy up there .,1
everybody has to see it and take a selfy at least once in his life,1
get passes early and skip the lines .,1
"the eiffel tower is amazing to see , especially at night .",1
"the lines were just starting to form -lrb- there are a few lines you will go through , again , assuming you do n't have tickets -rrb- .",1
going at night is a must .,1
easy as there was a display providing details about eiffel and all his architectural achievements at most of the landings .,1
a great value for money attraction .,1
i enjoyed the arc de triomphe and its view a lot more .,1
if you continue up to the top level -lrb- extra fee -rrb- the view will only be better if the day is perfectly clear .,1
you do n't .,1
"there were some algerian guys who were singing , some people were following with the music , some were enjoying in music like me under the full moon night here .",1
"from the top of the eifel tower you will have an excellent view over paris , but buy the ticket online before .",1
other options for budget conscious travelers would be the arc de triomphe and the montparnasse towers .,1
you ca n't go to paris without seeing the eiffel tower .,1
"if you want to eat , avoid the restaurants near and around the tower .",1
"coming down via lift/elevator was free for all , it is 2 elevators to get to ground level from the top .",1
if weather permits a picnic on the grass during the day would be nice,1
who would n't like to see the eifel tower close up and personal .,1
this structure has different attraction toward it .,1
we took a river cruise from there and it was lovely .,1
"if you stand up here , you should try to go up",1
my husband and i were on a tour with seniors from coffee break tour and this was one of our excursions from the ms amadeus ship .,1
"the tower turned white , then red , then blue , then red and green , etc. etc. .",1
i imagine those who drove had quite the long commute home .,1
we walked to the 2nd story .,1
we decided to pick a late afternoon/evening time slot and happy we did it .,1
there was a african dance festival going on nearby and you could hear the drums over the violinist by us .,1
"the european cup , the industrial/political issues impacted on the timing of our visit to eifel experience .",1
"if this is your first or only trip to paris , you have to visit the eiffel tower and go up to the observation decks .",1
this is the second time i 've been here and i 'm just as amazed the second time .,1
around 11 pm in night it got lightened up & what a mesmerizing view .,1
impressive building especially when it 's dark .,1
overall a very disappointing experience .,1
awsm view from summit .,1
we booked using a tour guide to get access to queue jumps - totally worth it .,1
"we had a guide that got us around some of the lines , but there really was n't much of any line in the early evening .",1
we walked the stairs to the second tier and i 'm so happy to say that !!,1
we went only for the day .,1
one for the memory banks !!,1
i had always wanted to stand under it and take a photo looking up .,1
"no matter what time of the day , people exercising , jogging , walking dogs , kids shouting and playing and laughing , friends sharing a bottle of wine or two on a blanket .",1
it 's an amazing experience .,1
unsure if this is a regular thing or just because it was valentines .,1
"i found paris dirty , full of rubbish in the streets ... .",1
the elevator was easy and efficient .,1
you start appreciating paris more when you look at it from the top !,1
if you buy in advance you can pick up your tickets and skip the line .,1
there is simply no quiet time to go !,1
"security is tight but when you go up the tower , the views are breathtaking .",1
"seen it so many times , never ceases to amaze !",1
"if you 're going , book in advance .",1
the interwoven structure is inspiring .,1
awesome views and great geometry marvel .,1
"my first visit to paris -lrb- my wife 's 3rd -rrb- , so i insisted on going to the eiffel tower .",1
not for the faint hearted - but 17 euro will not break the bank .,1
"as with all the attractions , better be early than late .",1
it was a beautiful clear evening with the stars behind the tower .,1
the views from the top are really nice too .,1
we had a great time at and around the eiffel tower this time and here 's what we did different -,1
"take the lift or walk , but you must go up the tower .",1
"be careful of the pick pockets that work in this area , it 's no more prevalent than any other city in busy areas .",1
one tip dnt eat in cafe up tower services rubbish and food is horrible and expensive,1
trocadero gardens has some of the best vantage points .,1
it makes for perfect day ~,1
"it 's right next to the restaurant , a tiny little rink where we skated with a few children and other tourists .",1
"although it was extremely busy when we went at the end of august , my daughters went 1 week later -lrb- early september -rrb- and they did not encounter crowds as we did -lrb- probably because british kids were back at school -rrb- .",1
on summer days the lines can be long so i recommend purchasing tickets on line prior to visiting .,1
i purchased my ticket and went up the first elevator .,1
we went up to the 2nd observation level and the views were amazing .,1
and i mean far .,1
the eiffle tower is a stunning `` wonder '' not to be missed on your travels abroad .,1
its a feast for eyes ... and as it goes dark the sight turns beautiful .,1
you can bet you will be approached : someone wanting you to buy something - shady people asking you to take a survey or wanting to `` gift '' you with a braided bracelet .,1
"we visited the eiffel tower on a saturday evening and began queuing at about 6.00 pm , we hadn , t booked in advance and had to queue for about 90 minutes but it was worth it .",1
you can watch it across the river with an elevated view .,1
it 's really amazing with its imposing structure and i was really excited to go up its elevator to the second floor .,1
it was cold and raining when we were there .,1
we later discovered that trocadero is probably the best metro station to get the really amazing views across the river to the tower and this at night people congregate here to get the best evening views once the tower lights up .,1
the greatest must-go sight to see in paris .,1
you will be able to purchase a ticket for the first two levels .,1
we took a metro to get there .,1
how can you not stop at the eiffel tower if you go to paris ... it is large and beautiful and in the evening it is lit up and breathtaking ... this just makes paris that much more magical !!,1
"of course , there was not much shelter once up in the tower , so best to be prepared with a poncho or umbrella .",1
we hung out and had lunch around the tower and took the best photo 's !,1
climb up if you have energy or down to read facts on the stairs .,1
just sit and enjoy the beauty of paris .,1
"there are lots of vendors on the ground selling food , drinks , clothes and even soaps .",1
what an imposing structure .,1
"we bought our tickets about a month ahead straight from the eiffel tower site , and we skipped the many hour line when we arrived -lrb- such a relief to skip that incredible line , and worth the extra effort -rrb- .",1
it was my 3rd time in france this year and my 3rd time in paris as well .,1
the river seine complements the tower really well .,1
nothing compares to looking out on the beautiful parisian arrondissements from high atop the eiffel tower .,1
we got to see the eiffel in the afternoon and evening and the dancing lights made it extra special .,1
from level 2 it is an elevator to go to the top but the queues were just too long as we had further plans afterwards so we had to leave that .,1
"that way you get to see the sun going down , and then the hourly light show that makes the tower sparkle on the hour , every hour after the sun sets .",1
good to do at night as the skyline is .,1
"the queues to go up the tower are horrendous as there are only lifts operating on two of the four legs , with the third being a walking staircase only and the fourth being totally out of commission for any access .",1
"during the day , walking around the area i felt like there were so many tourists pushing and shoving .",1
its just gorgeous day and night esp on summer when the sky is really blue .,1
but one visit is more than enough to this landmark ...,1
the most special part came when it got to 10pm and for five minutes the tower sparkles with huge fiary lights .,1
disliked an almost 3 hour wait in a queue .,1
finally reaching the front desk to discover last minute closure of the summit,1
try to catch a photo at dusk .,1
do prior booking and take tickets to go to the top floor and have a scenic view of city of paris .,1
lines and crowds large .,1
"the elevator is uncomfortable if you have claustrophobia or a fear of heights , but it 's doable if your fears are n't extreme .",1
we ended up spending too much time here which cost us time at the musee d'orsay .,1
"yes , the parisienne 's may not have initially appreciated this piece but nothing says paris like the eiffel tower .",1
all the people should come to visit here once in life !,1
"recommend the catering vans just outside the perimeter , best hotdog i 've had in years",1
worth it though .,1
"this made us feel safe , and we understood why , but i was saddened by this too .",1
they even drink wine and relax .,1
if possible check the weather and plan to go on a sunny day .,1
it has a great viewpoint and there are plenty of cafes around the area .,1
the view was amazing eventhough there was fog and drizzle so it must be pretty awesome during clear night or daytime .,1
why bother ?,1
you should take a couple minutes looking at this masterpiece in front of you and not take the moment for granted .,1
of course everyone should go if in paris at least once .,1
the food was really good as we ate at the cafe .,1
enjoyed our time there,1
it is a marvel and extreme in it 's own category .,1
must stay till the end of the night when it sparkles !,1
ca n't help returning there every time in paris .,1
very picturesque especially from a boat cruise .,1
so what made this trip extra special ?,1
"you need to see to believe , but it 's the most important to gain the top !",1
i was in paris for 3 days and visited eiffel twice a day .,1
save yourself the wait in lines .,1
my 10 year old daughter and i walked from the louvre to the eiffel tower - it 's a beautiful walk .,1
"however , by night it 's a whole different story .",1
i enjoyed this massive construct of scaffolding .,1
we went just before dusk which i recommend as you go up in daylight and watch paris come to life as night falls from the top .,1
"the eiffel tower is huge , and you got to go to see it if you are in paris , during the daytime and at least to see it from the outside during the night time .",1
we did a lot of research on how and when to visit the tower ... we opted to do the skip the line tour at 5 pm ... best decision of our trip .,1
if you go closer to evening the lines are not as long .,1
"if you go to the top you can come back down and get out on floor 2 , go down to floor 1 as well and watch the little movie about the building of the eiffel tower .",1
its a must see . . . .,1
because it was a my dreaming place of travelling .,1
beware of gypsies around the base although the gendarmes are usually present to keep this under control .,1
buy tickets early from their site -lrb- no third party -rrb- for good rate and to skip the -lrb- very long -rrb- queue .,1
it amazes me that the french can get a champagne bar and toilets all the way up the top but us british ca n't even get trains working in the wind !,1
mats samaras family -lrb- two adults and two children 11 and 1 -rrb- year -rrb- bought `` to go before sex '' tickets which also included a guide .,1
buy presale or group tour to get in at a designated time if do n't want to wait .,1
"if you are able bodied it is best to just walk up to the first level and then the second level , i thought it was going to be a really tough slog but it was easy and you can rest along the way .",1
you have to book online to get tickets in order to avoid lines .,1
the bartender even gave me the cork out of our bottle as a souvenir .,1
not as difficult as i thought -lrb- the whole 722 stairs ... -rrb- .,1
"then staff indicated we were early for our slot , we would only need to be at gate 5 mins ahead to find first cue and from there on rude staff handling us like cattle ` squeeze in ' ... spend about 1,5 hour to get to top & back ... feels like all we did was cuing and listening to rude staff not speaking any language but french ... disappointing",1
"the queue to visit the top was long , but worth the wait for the amazing views .",1
the view from below is worth it .,1
"the views from the eiffel tower are lovely , but i would prefer to see the tower from a distance on my next trip .",1
great from anywhere the city but very amazing site from near by !,1
so glad we did this as the timing was great and we skipped all the queues .,1
"we returned to the trocadero that evening to people watch while waiting for the lights to appear followed by the 11pm changing colored red , white & blue lights .",1
"we arrived there around 17h20 , it took several mins to get through the security check , we had to queue for almost 30 mins to buy the tickets , and it took 10 mins to queue for entering into elevator .",1
with europa just round the corner the massive ball at the centre was another added attraction .,1
then when we got there they said it was $ 20 per person .,1
"did n't go on the tower ; however , it was beautiful day or night .",1
also france was playing in the european cup .,1
"we walked all around , underneath and then on the walk back over the seine .",1
how this monument has been built : you just ca n't believe it .,1
tickets were cheap to walk as well ad i would definitely recommend,1
beautiful view and a wonderful experience for older kids and adults .,1
"we were worried about the bar closing as they advertised it , but the staff were very good after the delayed ascend and kept all open for longer ... top marks for sorting all , top views of course , ... and as night fell the park below filled with people sitting on the grass , ... and smack on 2200hours the whole tower was flashing with lghts and stars , ... wow ... will prepare for it next time and may be viewing it from outside , or even the view/restaurant in montparnasse tower .",1
"we were there the first week of may , i ca n't imagine the summer crowds .",1
unable to sit outside and enjoy a coffee or beer without being pestered for cigs or money by various nationalities begging wo n't be back needless to say,1
"then , at the top of every hour , for 5 minutes , it magically sparkles with lights .",1
"a trip , try and at least know greeting words in french as they can get s little rude if you simply try and communicate in english .",1
it is marvelous !!!!,1
"this time , less crowded and all piller was working .",1
i absolutely loved the little light show .,1
it is beautiful view .,1
the eiffel tower creates an iconic skyline .,1
book in advance as it gets booked up fast and book it for the night .,1
"understandably , it gets very crowded in the lifts .",1
better luck next time .,1
we went straight to the second floor to purchase our tickets to the top to avoid queues .,1
don ´ t make the mistake of not going up .,1
"even during the off season , the wait to take the elevators is several hours .",1
will do it again !,1
"the cafe 's are pricy , and so are the shops but it 's the experience , the ice rink is free .",1
you really need to take the trip up the tower to get the full effect .,1
the elevators take you to the second floor first .,1
we went just before sunset so we were able to see the views during the daylight and nighttime .,1
"even of you take the stairs , you need to go to the last floor to enjoy the beautiful view of paris .",1
no words can express my awe and wonder of this ugly but very stunning metal structure .,1
a must do and the lines are a lot shorter than the rest and you just have to do 669 steps and a good way to work off all the escargot and foie gras .,1
there is an opportunty to grab champagne on the top .,1
very romantic at night !,1
lines are shorter and the city of lights is at its most beautiful .,1
"if you come with children bring water and food , to buy on the eiffel will cost much more .",1
but it 's well worth it !,1
the boat ride self is worthwhile .,1
so we stood in line and went to the top .,1
buy tickets as early as possible to ensure they have spots available for the dates you will be there .,1
i was there a week after the attacks and the tower was lit in the colors of its flag .,1
the views are wonderful and hopefully the photo 's will attest to this .,1
do n't need to go to the top of you do n't want to - you can admire the architecture from outside .,1
husbands wallet was stolen as soon as we entered grounds by women in a cluster with clipboards.spent day in police station .,1
but i walked on several parts of it and was impressed .,1
"i know its just a tower , but there is something about eiffel tower that you will never be bored of it .",1
i do not like heights so we did not go up in it .,1
the view from the surrounding and the tower top was splendid .,1
"if you want a good view of paris , try the montparnasse tower or the rooftop of the galerie lafayette department store .",1
it 's worth the,1
the eiffel tower is just amazing !,1
this is a good walk to do - see fashionable parisians enjoy the streets of paris and then reach the eiffel .,1
the best view of paris is from the summit .,1
every night at 9pm it lights up and sparkles for around 5 minutes which is lovely to see .,1
we stay in a place about 4 blocks away so it was our landmark : -rrb-,1
we had an excellent guide niko who told us many facts about the tower and did it with humour .,1
we both went right to the top .,1
i had a spare hour in paris so jumped on a couple of metro trains to visit the tower .,1
it 's just a magnificent icon of paris that everyone should see it once in their life time .,1
enjoy ...,1
- just make it part of the experience and enjoy !,1
the structure is magnificent and the view was incredible !!!!!,1
you get to see the construction up close .,1
the panoramic views are to die for !,1
we bought the tickets to all 3 levels and it was fun .,1
well worth it to go straight through the queues .,1
"this is a spectacular sight , which our whole family loved , but i do not recommend waiting in the 2-3 hour line to go up .",1
"given the time of year , first week of august , the tourist season was at a peak & long lines prevailed so unfortunately did n't have time to venture upwards to the top plus was on a budget .",1
the eiffel tower has a nice view from the 2nd floor .,1
they warn you that they are exceptionally bad at the tower .,1
"note that the tickets to level 3 of the eiffel tower is only available at level 2 for an additional fee of eur 6,50 .",1
i did n't want to miss it so paid much more than i was intending to go up with a tour group .,1
"alas , in mid-july the lines for tickets are 1-2 hours long .",1
"one the hour in the evening , the lights twinkle .",1
"overall the tower is a must see , just be prepared for the rude people working there .",1
"we wanted to catch the night views when the sky is fully dark , but by then the top part was already closed for the day",1
"you can either walk up or there are lifts up , but you have to change lifts half way up .",1
purchase your ticket in advance -lrb- via internet -rrb- to avoid too long a wait in long lines .,1
it only costs 5 euro to walk it .,1
go all the way up .,1
the 3rd floor was so worth the money and so beautiful but be prepared to wait in line and be patient if you have n't bought the fast track tickets as all round we probably spent 3 hours there with half a hour looking around .,1
it can get pretty crowded at the summit but it is beautiful and worth the view .,1
it was a rainy day when we went and very misty .,1
good thing is that i did n't have to wait on the ticket line -lrb- which was about 20-30mins - elevator nord side -rrb- because i had already waited on the line and the ticket agent remembered me .,1
as i was a first time visitor to france - i was so amazed at the wonders of technology and modernization - the tower was built .,1
this is the icon of paris ... it looms over the city .,1
i am always want to visit this wonderful eiffel tower and i found it is more than beautiful when you go and see it must see this tower while you are in paris .,1
guide was snotty & unaccommdating .,1
lines were n't to long and the view on a not so clear day was magnificent,1
the view from the second floor is great and the weather was suitable to get a ticket to the top .,1
standing under eiffel tower is one of the best feelings i 've had in my life .,1
we had tickets to go all the way up to the top - all i can say is that overall it was a good experience but i did not enjoy being crushed into the lifts and literally having to edge my way around to see anything and getting down was a nightmare .,1
made it up there and was so happy i did it .,1
there was even a lady with a cane going up .,1
recommend evening visits,1
if you want to see the roofs of paris better to go to some cafes or restaurants that propose magnificient views .,1
i visited back again after my dinner .,1
i would really recommend that you go to the eiffel tower on the hour as it sparkles for 5 minutes and that 's the moment you smile to yourself and say ` la vie est belle ',1
"this saved a significant amount of time , since we were there in july when crowds are high .",1
"but get down before midnight , the eiffel lighting starts sparkling at 12 ... .",1
"beware : as it is owned by a private company , paris museum pass does not work for this monument !",1
once up there the views are amazing .,1
it has a great view of eiffel tower from the boat as you approach it .,1
first was steps and second was the lift .,1
to stand centered underneath it looking up is awesome .,1
we went there on a monday morning .,1
it is outstanding .,1
be prepared for alot of steps .,1
"at last i done that , it 's really a memorable moment for me .",1
this is another do n't miss place of paris !,1
we chose not to walk up the stairs so we joined the queue for the lift .,1
"we love to see it at night , and every hour the lights on the tower give us a sparkling show .",1
"at night , it feels wonderfully romantic when it is lit up .",1
you see it for miles such is the flat nature of the area around paris .,1
the best time is at night and on the hour when it twinkles .,1
amazing structure .,1
an absolute must see if you 're in paris !,1
this is a must for anyone visiting paris .,1
"2.5 hours queue , and a broken escalator .",1
wonderful !,1
we missed the twinkling lights at night but the experience was still awesome .,1
my son and i climbed it while my hubby and our 2 girls took the elevator .,1
"pay a little extra to take the elevator , and just walk down the steps .",1
"and how lucky to go up in the tower , while there you need to purchase a trinket from there shop just so you can say you did , i purchased key chains for everyone .",1
a part from the tower being over protective i suggest you book in advanced .,1
once again there are too many people trying to go up the tower and there is a 2 hour waiting time in which you could possibly get bombed as there are troops everywhere .,1
you have torque again just to wait for the lift on any of the legs .,1
lots of photo opportunities of the eiffel tower and long queues to get up .,1
once you 're on top though it is a great view of the whole city and all of the streets .,1
"as this was my second visit , i was able to compare this experience with that of the one way back in 1998 .",1
lovely views across the city with a special glow by the sun at low angle .,1
"it was during euro 2016 , so there were probably more crowds than usual , but also the standard guys selling beer/rose out of an ice bucket .",1
we had a short tour so we did not have to stand in a long line for tickets .,1
it is wonderful .,1
"when traveling for the first time to france or wanting to show first time guests , the eiffel tower is a must stop .",1
"it is a must-see , but if you have very little time in paris it is better to spend it on parisian sights that are really unique - such as notre dame or louvre .",1
"in total , a very beautiful place and a must visit if you are in paris .",1
when in france you have to check out the eiffel tower .,1
we went up when it was still light and got to see the view in the light and in the dark .,1
"spectacular , unbeatable views of paris and an amazing piece of engineering .",1
you ca n't leave without seeing the eifel tower !,1
we went until the last level and this is amazing .,1
"however , up close it loses its luster and looks like a pile of metal .",1
do n't come to paris and not visit the eiffel tower .,1
views from the top were amazing and to see the structure close up was incredible .,1
does the elevator take you directly down ?,1
"thought the summit was well worth doing , though you need a head for heights to do the lift ride .",1
the views are breathtaking and is a must see .,1
the tour guide had us lined up at the wrong lift but thankfully some french tourists travelling with us found out where our group needed to go .,1
"eiffel tower truly lived to its hype , we happened to witness the human marvel in day and night , must say was lifetime experience .",1
"now that i live here , im still not getting tired of seeing it often !",1
you can see the structure of the tower - an ingenious invention !,1
you might even see the odd proposal going on too .,1
there are plenty of places in paris to grab a view of the city .,1
book your tickets in advance cause it will save you a lot of time .,1
"it has a great view of the whole city , which looks enormous from up there .",1
they are very firm about the time slot you pick .,1
better walking than taking the elevator - from every step you might admire paris from above .,1
visiting the tower is a paris must do but definitely recommend to purchase tickets in advance as queues can be pretty long .,1
go to paris check it out !,1
the eiffel tower is really interesting mainly during the nights when all the lights are flashing .,1
"upside to nighttime , the lights show every hour on the hour for 5 minutes .",1
we went at 10:30 and were able to walk right in - by the time we got down the line at the pre-purchase entrance was quite long .,1
"and also visit during nighttime , as the tower illuminates beautifully .",1
any great location associated with a great city begins to haunte you .,1
the second stage is high enough to provide a great 360 view of paris and with the christmas lights all around it really is the city of light specially when it sparkles on the hour .,1
"got to the top took a bunch of photos for 20 minutes , then waited an hour to go to 2nd level only to wait again for an hour to go to ground level .",1
"we arrived at the tower around 1 pm and much to our surprise , we were told that the line was closed for the day and we would have to come back another time !",1
be prepared to spend more than an hour or two there .,1
to have a great view and to capture good picture of eiffel tower go to tracadero and from there you will have a great view of the eiffel tower .,1
was very quiet when we went so only waited in the queue for 10 mins .,1
"the carousels were turning , pictures were being taken , and the sun shone brightly .",1
make sure you 're there on the hour in the evening as the tower comes alive and twinkles every hour on the hour for 5 mins .,1
be aware this is a huge pickpockets paradise .,1
waited about 30 mins to pay and then we were on 2nd floor within the next 30 mins .,1
on christmas time there was a small fair at the bottom and really nice illuminations .,1
very beautiful views from the viewing deck .,1
i 've gone twice now and have been up both stairs and elevator -lrb- very squished -rrb- .,1
the tickets are around 17 euros and for people below 24 years it is cheaper .,1
we did originally plan to go up at around 11am however the lines were phenomenally long and we decided against it .,1
buy tickets in advance to avoid waiting .,1
elevator takes you up !,1
go early in the morning to miss some of the crowds and be able to leisurely walk around the park and enjoy the whole area .,1
get their early .,1
we went at 3pm and once we were up on the 3rd floor we were informed the office that sold tickets to the top was closed because there were too many people waiting to go up .,1
also walk down if you can it 's less waiting for lifts,1
it is worth the visit to see the craftsmanship and a great view,1
"nearly every visitor to paris makes the pilgrimage here at least once , and for good reason : it 's an amazing feeling to stand underneath it , and exciting to walk up to the sec one level .",1
i went to the eiffel tower two years ago with one of my friends and we took the elevator up to the top floor of the tower .,1
i would definitely recommend seeing it at night if you ever get a chance to go to paris .,1
"yep , it 's 100 euros for a 3 course lunch ... but ... you get to skip the line , go up to the 2nd floor in a private elavator , have an amazing michelin-starred lunch ... it made sense to me .",1
we paid a high price for lunch there really so we could have access without long lines but our line was still long and tiring .,1
that 's when it gets interesting !,1
the view from the top overlooking the river and the louvre is magnificent .,1
the only thing wrong with views of paris from the tower is that the eiffel tower is n't in them .,1
"the first day we landed in paris , we drove straight away to the eiffel tower .",1
skip the waiting ... and just take the stairs to the 2nd level ... works everytime .,1
well worth the walk up the steps .,1
what can be said about the beautiful eiffel tower ?!?,1
"i mean , we 're told we have to right ?",1
still worth it though .,1
this time i went up at night .,1
over the years this must about the 10th time i have been up .,1
so here 's the lesson that i learned the hard way .,1
the summit tour is worth the champagne toast and great selfies .,1
by the time one reaches an upper level ... it 's difficult to care anymore .,1
just beware of people hawking their wares or the `` do you speak english ? '',1
"did n't get the chance to go on the eiffel tower , poor tour .",1
"if you are going on the eiffel tower , give your self enough time to line up , even if you prebooked tickets .",1
the queue lasted for around 90 minutes after the security checks .,1
then you can take the elevator all the way down to the ground level .,1
we have waited our whole young lives to see the eiffel tower .,1
well obviously it 's amazing !,1
love paris ❤,1
i coughed for two days .,1
i have been obsessed with the tower for years and finally had my opportunity to visit .,1
"we were attracted by the shell game and thought its a genuine game , the way they present looks like its a real game .",1
the little `` apartment '' at the summit was a bit disappointing i had hoped it would be larger and shed more light on how he lived there but none the less it was a great experience and one i would definitely recommend .,1
this should be seen in daylight & also the night .,1
"from the floors , the view is breathtaking of the trocadero palace !",1
we went to the top which was an amazing sight but freezing at night so bring a hat and mittens of your visiting in the off season !,1
it was s great visit .,1
obviously a must see attraction when visiting paris .,1
buy some pictures with the view from up there ... .,1
the lighting effects on the eiffel tower made the experience even more memorable .,1
"other than that , the guy who sells the macaroons on the second level was very nice on top of handsome and the wine was better than most .",1
2nd floor has the best views of the city .,1
"day or night , this landmark is a sight to see .",1
a must see both day and night .,1
"at night , every hour the tour shines beautifully , small light turn on sparkling and you can enjoy a romantic scenery .",1
the views from the top especially on a fine day are amazing .,1
one is nice probably,1
-lrb- haha -rrb- a must in paris !,1
he laid a 20 $ bill and coins on the counter .,1
"if you have any question about going up in it , you definitely need to do it !",1
just be prepared to be squashed into the lifts .,1
we went to the 2nd floor and then two of us went to the very top .,1
i saw a russian couple were taking their wedding video too .,1
pretty to see even from a distance .,1
i did n't really know what to expect when we went to see the eiffel tower and although i was excited to go i cant describe how amazing our trip was .,1
my anxiety grew higher and higher with every minute i had to wait as my wife was waiting below .,1
ok you queue a lot but it 's so worth it ... why come to paris and not go up it ?!!!!!!!,1
also download the app from the official eiffel tower website .,1
that kind of structure that kind of build !,1
"due to being limited on time , we did n't go inside so we admired the tower by staying around the gates .",1
an excellent venue with superb views across paris .,1
this is a tourism must-see .,1
visit during the day and at night for views forever .,1
please beware that the louvre is not open on tuesday .,1
it 's best if you 've already had a city tour or boat cruise and can then identify things from a different perspective .,1
it 's really lovely and romantic .,1
"if you are somewhat fit -lrb- or no handicap -rrb- , you should be able to take the stairs challenge .",1
just spectacular and worthy of all the hype .,1
"if you have n't , however , a visit to the base at least is a near requirement for one visiting paris .",1
never get fed of it .,1
"here , there is a short film of historic moments at the tower .",1
a romantic enchanting experience .,1
"she would speak a couple words in french , then walk away to let her colleague explain in english , then come back and explain some more , and this went on for three rounds .",1
"had its detractors made it through , this amazing piece of architecture would have vanished in 1909 itself !!",1
there is a cafe and toilets on top .,1
it has a glass floor in some of the parts of the floor and it was nice for relaxing on the benches near the fountain part of the floor .,1
"i know that in many touristic places this is the norm , however it would be great if the police put some order in here .",1
lots of people and long queues .,1
we took a ticket for the 2nd floor by stairs and it cost us 14 euro -lrb- 2 tickets -rrb- .,1
and it is all very well organised .,1
"this is a fabulous place , the views of the city skyline were breathtaking and this is indeed a beautiful city .",1
be ready to take stunning pictures .,1
to walk under and around it is awesome in itself .,1
once you 've queued to go up up to the first level prepare to queue again to go up to the top level of the tower .,1
i doubt we will visit again .,1
it had pretty standard french fare which is always fresh and delicious .,1
"this honestly made me a bit sad since the cafes and gift shops are magnets for tourists but of course , it 's all clever tourist accommodations .",1
"but , if you are in paris ... it is definitely a must see .",1
and if you buy your tickets online you 'll save time !,1
the climb is upto the second level .,1
its windy at the top but the view is breathtaking .,1
"we took the stairs down from the first level which is pretty cool because you get an up-close look at the iron work , the elevators and the engineering required to built such a fantastic structure .",1
i just waited two minutes for the lift to go up .,1
i myself found it more impressive from the ground !,1
"efficiency is the key even with the long lines , people were moved in and out with no problems .",1
we had good time,1
only 17 euros to go to the top .,1
the young woman asking `` english ? '',1
the view from top is truly amazing .,1
so we added this to our itinerary after we found that we had sufficient time before hotel check-in .,1
make sure you spend some time on the 1st level which has some interesting video of the engineering mechanisms and some hair-raising photos of the original construction .,1
there was a strong police presence and we saw some distressed people who appeared to have been pickpocketed and had wallets taken from their bags .,1
must come here once in a lifetime .,1
a 20 minute wait to ride the elevators is normal but so worth it .,1
paris is on thing during the day and a completely different animal at night .,1
"the tower is amazing , if you dont want to wait , just use the stairs to the 2nd floor .",1
arrive before 10 to avoid a long queue if you do n't purchase tickets online in advance .,1
one tip for those travelling you must see the marvel in day and night .,1
romantic landscape could be seen from the tower .,1
"also , there are many warnings of pickpockets so be sure to secure your belongings .",1
key attraction of paris .,1
always wanted to go and it did n't disappoint if anything it was better !,1
the eiffel is an impressing tour .,1
we were waiting for about 1.5 hrs to get to the ground level .,1
"i often go to paris and i am never tired of walking by , visiting , going up or simply looking at the eiffel tower .",1
"surprisingly there were no lines , but this may have been because it was 3 weeks after the bombings and was slightly drizzeling that night .",1
"do book ahead and avoid the crowds , you still have to wait a bit , then through security and beware of pick-pocket signs everywhere",1
then i took the stairs ... boom !,1
it is also really lovely to see at night when it is all lite up .,1
a must see whilst in paris .,1
even though the weather the rainy and windy the tour was worth what we paid for .,1
this was my first time in about 20 + years since last visiting paris .,1
the lines can be extremely line so i would recommend buying your tickets ahead of time .,1
"here ios a tip : we thought we could get off at the first level , have something to eat and look around , and then head up to the second level .",1
i would probably do the presale tickets rather than the tour .,1
"a pleasant , unexpected surprise .",1
every 20 years i make time to revisit the greats .,1
also it is really quiet and provides a peaceful environment to gaze over paris in .,1
its big !!!,1
we went about an hour before it closed on a friday night and there were no lines .,1
chill out with a drink and take in the amazing views .,1
the view is awesome from the second level where the buildings are more refined .,1
view from top is spectacular .,1
"it 's tempting to just drive by and appreciate it from afar , but do n't do it !",1
well worth the queuing on the upper levels .,1
its beautiful yet simple .,1
"fantastic view from the top , especially if the weather is good .",1
really loved the visit .,1
this was the part of the trip that i wanted to see the most and it was incredible .,1
keep your money and give it to the local little shops back up the road should you wish to buy some keepsakes .,1
it 's an unforgettable experience visit eiffel tower .,1
we went in a night tour with tickets to the second floor with pariscityvision no queues and great tour and the sights were amazing .,1
"we arrived 7:15 and sat in the sun eating fruit watching the world go by , as well as admiring the tower .",1
book ahead .,1
after standing in line for elevator -lrb- with pre-purchased tickets -rrb- i did not want to get in another line to go to the top .,1
"i left a piece of my heart in paris , best city in the world !",1
"we were able to go at 9pm without a reservation , but i would recommend trying to get a reservation .",1
"i went in winter , so the view was covered by mist and cloud .",1
one can see a breathtaking view of paris from the 2nd floor .,1
far from the maddening crowd .,1
"was rainy when we went , but still was cool just being able to go up on the second level .",1
queuing took 3.5 hrs .,1
one of highlights of my trip .,1
there is another ticket office on level 2 to get to the top of the tower but the ticket office was closed and the queues for it waiting to open went round and round that stage .,1
big mistake !!,1
the queue to go up the tower is really really long .,1
however coming from canada and having the cn tower the magnitude of such an enchanting building is amazing .,1
"for a memorable evening experience take a bottle of wine to trocadero metro station , bask in the late night tango dancing and mingle amongst the people and enjoy a glass of vin in front of the beautifully lit eiffel tower .",1
"yes , the metal construction is nothing special from the ground but you should see paris from the up < 3",1
"also , avoid those who gather on the grounds to sell merchandise without a license .",1
i enjoyed the nighttime views from the top of the tower and a view into the old apartment of mr. eiffel .,1
"we were in a considerable line , but the line constantly moved .",1
such an iconic symbol .,1
daniel the irish guy was one of the best tour guides ever .,1
it is n't possible to fully appreciate the detail of the tower until you 're standing beneath it .,1
there are not enough words to describe the eiffel tower !!,1
it 's better in person than i dreamt it would be all my life .,1
"we got to the tower early - 9:30 am , not too busy ... passing by later , saw it was much busier by noon so go early if you can .",1
not in the early morning .,1
a landmark to navigate your way around paris .,1
seeing the effiel tower up close and from afar gives you a sense of romance .,1
its design is a feat of engineering and is a must see when in beautiful paris .,1
"not just being an icon , you must really really make sure you visit this spot in the evening , when the lights go dim , the magic starts .",1
i can say this is the one of the best tower in the world .,1
all the staff were friendly and helpful throughout .,1
"as you stroll along the seine and gaze at the eiffel tower , you have to pinch yourself to know its real life .",1
"just seeing it is n't enough though , you should definitely walk all the way to the top .",1
mission accomplished .,1
we sat outside at benches and enjoyed full show .,1
avoid the cafe !,1
because of the weather .,1
"though it was chilly , it was still a beautiful site to see all of the colors lighting up the city .",1
and its just so beautiful .,1
"were on the tower , 2nd level .",1
security checkpoint - checking bag contents to access the grounds then almost airport like checkpoint before you can access the elevators to get to the top .,1
"we wanted to give up as we were getting tired and hungry , but were happy we did not .",1
good ride on the boat .,1
the light show -lrb- happens every hour after dark -rrb- is interesting .,1
i even went all out and got a selfie stick too !,1
"the eiffel tower was beautiful , especially at night when the lights twinkle on the hour .",1
"she is beautiful , yes ?",1
this is one tourist trap that does n't leave you disappointed .,1
not only do you have to go there when in paris .,1
"we saw the tower by day and it was rather dull and not very pretty , but then we saw it at night and what a glorious transformation when it 's lit up .",1
"fabulous views of the city , great for children , good value $ 4 for kids $ 11 for adults .",1
"even though it was peak holiday time , virtually no line for security and not very crowded .",1
look out for pick pockets and buy souvenirs from the market in the park rather than the ` official ' shop inside !,1
long queue below the eiffel tower for tickets by elevator and not take the stairs .,1
make sure not to take anything with you that you mind parting with if asked,1
"lines are long to enter the first security point , and also the second security point - luckily we had skip the line tickets so only took about 15 minutes from arrival until going up .",1
"this is absolutely gorgeous , from the city lights tour of paris in all its glory and beauty .",1
not to be missed,1
"we paid for a tour guide meet us to take us up , and this was helpful to avoid the crazy , huge lineups everywhere -lrb- a morning on a tuesday in july !",1
"thankfully , we avoided this because our guide pointed it out , but we saw all kinds of them `` working '' the crowds after that !",1
we went late in the day around 6pm .,1
we saw the eiffel tower with a skip the line tour and it was definitely worth it .,1
"last time i visited the eiffel tower was over 25 yr ago , i could n't go up it then either , it 's immense but i love it , a beautiful piece",1
"then when you get inside , there are separate lines to purchase tickets -lrb- one for walking up the stairs , and one for talking the elevator -rrb- .",1
"expect a wait despite your timed ticket , but it 's well worth the patience .",1
amazing how much higher it looks from up there .,1
"`` this is not paris , this is parisdise ! ''",1
"if you wish to see the tower at a day time , come early - tickets are available on site , though you need to be on a long queue .",1
it was just too cold .,1
several other couples had same issue !,1
recommended to visit during the eveningtime .,1
we were tired and debated going to see this landmark at dark but i 'm so glad we did .,1
"one night , we went up the summit late at night - so late that we missed the champagne opportunity -lrb- but i digress -rrb- ; however , we did this to take in the lights .",1
"we purchased advance tickets online , about two months prior to the trip .",1
your post cards will be marked eiffel tower paris !,1
no point spending huge money on restaurants up there,1
"wrap up warm , it gets cold up there , though i did travel in the easter period .",1
we only went up to the base which was fine as i 'm not too good with heights,1
also there are two lifts going up so see which has a less line and take that .,1
-lrb- if you buy champagne on the 2nd floor it is much better priced -rrb- .,1
"spectacular views over the city , brilliant !",1
"when the lights came on it was absolutely stunning , beautiful little lake underneath it really was so lovely .",1
"we walked to the second floor 157 metres , a scary and wonderful experience .",1
"you wait 45 minutes because the tickets desk happens to be closed , solely on a random basis .",1
climb the stairs if the lines are too long and you 're physically able to .,1
booking a tour allows you to skip lines and the guide will provide essential historical background .,1
"it was a bit cold and windy , but still worth the visit .",1
we stayed close to the eiffel tower and spent lots of time at night there .,1
we did n't go inside but had a great time walking around !,1
"there was hardly any queue for this , while the queues for elevators were super long .",1
awesome experience !!!!!,1
we saw a wedding in the park below .,1
didnt go to the top but it was amazing !,1
it is magnificent and dominates the skyline of paris .,1
you could spend as much time as possible up there and it was amazing to take in the city views .,1
"during the day , eiffel tower is just another steel structure - without doubt an engineering marvel , but it is during the night with the lights on , the structure is mesmerizing beautiful .",1
this wonder of world does not need any introduction or detailed description .,1
"it was phenomenal to see the legendary eiffel tower , especially at evening with all the lights .",1
a must see from top of eiffel tower the city of light in the paris evening .,1
we visited during what we thought was the tourist low season and there were still lines .,1
climb on food wo n't wait for long but not elevators .,1
got some great photos .,1
the hot chocolate from the café on the 2nd floor was the best we had .,1
it took a couple of hours to snake our way to the front of the line .,1
"there was a long queue to buy a ticket , but we did n't wait long .",1
you will get a ticket for the lift from ground floor itself -lrb- approx waiting time 1 hour ~ it may be higher upto 2 hours on weekends - especially sunday -rrb- .,1
we were given a short history and then directed to the summit lift ... the wait here was 20 minutes and we were squashed onto the lift .,1
there is a free ice skating on the first floor which one must do if you have the time .,1
i especially like the new invisible floor ... not for the faint hearted though !!,1
i booked a reservation 2.5 months ahead of my vacation on the official website .,1
"many people write about this , yes , it is admirable .",1
it only took about 45 minutes to queue .,1
"even at that early -lrb- or so i thought -rrb- , there were n't lots of slots available to get tickets to go all the way to the top .",1
be attentive and watch for pickpockets - you will be reminded of this within the tower itself .,1
"at the top there are two areas , one is closed and heated .",1
the tower is super tall and i just love that their is a a park bear by to just sit down/lay down and relax while take in the breathetaking view of the tower especially near sunset .,1
nice bit of history as well as a great day out .,1
it is fantastic !,1
if you are going with little child with stroller you have to stroller put together .,1
"after all the movies and postcards , surely everyone who visits paris must make time for the eiffel tower .",1
there was absolutely no system or oversight for the lines/cues .,1
"they close the stairs at that time and everybody has to take the elevator , so , there can be a bit of a line-up .",1
just beware of pick pockets and those soliciting money from you while you are down in the grounds around it .,1
a do not miss in paris !,1
"thousands of people sitting on blankets ; families talking and couples holding each other , all looking toward the tower and the setting sun .",1
do n't be cheap .,1
"we spent over 2 hours there , mostly in a queue .",1
we got a hoho -lrb- hop on hop off -rrb- bus pass .,1
you will see it from many areas ... beautiful at night with lights on .,1
it was delicious and the staff were wonderful .,1
well worth the price to get to the top .,1
make sure you purchase tickets from an agency .,1
the second floor has a new glass floor area which is great for looking down and also has a new seating area made from recycled materials .,1
the views are good but the queues are long .,1
we walked about 1/4 mile to the seine river boat where we were given a private seating area in the front of the boat .,1
ca n't say anything new that everybody else has n't said .,1
"iconic , of course , and a must do .",1
"watch out for pick pocket , one lady in my group has lost $ 1100 .",1
nothing says `` paris '' like the eiffel tower .,1
he was surprised how clear everything was to see and very happy with himself that he got that far .,1
we went to the summit and the views were spectacular .,1
"you get a birdseye view of the city as you ascend , i recommend you buy your skip the line tickets in advance .",1
it was just as good as all the other times .,1
we headed to the general location for an early dinner and to see the area in the daylight .,1
what a site to see .,1
truly surreal experience .,1
"during the night , the tower has a good light show that happens hourly and it is beautiful to check .",1
a must see once in your life .,1
"what has n't been said , go at night , just jaw dropping .",1
eiffel tower is well worth a world heritage site & symbol of paris .,1
the line goes down very quick and a lot cheaper to pay there .,1
"many armies and police surrounding the area , although we have to queue for security check but it makes me feel safe .",1
you would think it 's the most impressive monument to see .,1
purchased tickets online for entrance to the very top of the tower .,1
we thought the latter on our first visit .,1
unfortunately the base of the tower has been blocked off unless you have a reservation at one of the restaurants in the tower .,1
great to see the steel lady in real life .,1
i am glad it did it twice but would n't go past the 2nd level again .,1
if you 're under 24 take your passport as you can get in cheaper .,1
i found the guide insightful and the tower magnificent .,1
we were lucky as we only queued 20 mins to get to walk up this fantastic piece of architecture this was the one thing my partner was looking forward to .,1
nice definitely a must see .,1
we checked the forecast before and made our way there when the top of tower was covered in cloud and fog .,1
afterwards you can walk to invalides -lrb- 20 minutes -rrb- via the rue saint dominique .,1
just keep walking and ignore them and they wo n't bother you .,1
i 'm in love with the eiffel tower .,1
we had decided to eat first near by and then go up around 9.30 pm ... it was good thinking the lines were minimal and the night time view amazing !!!,1
what i can saw about this amazing torre ?,1
the only thing that could have made it better would have been if the people werer n't bothering us with trying to sell us beer and wine .,1
it was really hard to get a photo without having a ton of people in your picture .,1
we expected the crowds to be thick but not at that time of the day .,1
inside shop and office at the middle of tower and views of night paris its great .,1
do n't pay for a tour .,1
it is great .,1
the eiffel tower is to paris what the statue of liberty is to new york and what big ben is to london .,1
"i have visited this several times , both during the day and at night .",1
we were there last fall 2015 and it was ok but much tighter security now .,1
you can buy food on the first stop to the top .,1
i recommend going to see it around sunset .,1
it 's exactly what you would expect .,1
you must go up the tower and have lunch or dinner .,1
loved it,1
hey !,1
my wife went to the top and saw many scared people .,1
try to climb the fence if need be to see it light up beautifully from a distance .,1
"on one of our recent weekends in paris , a friend was meeting us from the u.s. for whom it was her first time in france .",1
"for a good picture , i would recommend going a little ways away to get that perfect paris picture with the tower in the background",1
so you can not say you 've been to paris and not have at least gone to see it up close .,1
we went around 8:30 pm saturday night which only had a 30 min wait for the elevator line -lrb- everyone else is at dinner -rrb- ... buy your ticket up to the summit if that 's your plan -- this avoids lines to buy the second ticket when you are on the middle level ... go straight to the top ... you can visit the middle later ... by 9:30 there was a 1 + hour wait to get to the summit ...,1
"buy your tickets online , and enjoy the 2 elevators , that take you to the top of the paris !",1
"restaurants nearby , like the rest of paris , are quite expensive .",1
a private elevator took us to the restaurant on the second floor .,1
it was one of the most magnificent landmarks that i had the privilege of visiting .,1
"reasonably priced beer , the water and coke are very expensive",1
finally we visited this exquisite monument !,1
we lucked out and there was an event so the lights changed on the tower and it was absolutely amazing !,1
a must go when you visit paris .,1
upon my return it i made reservations 2 weeks on advance for the elevator to the top .,1
it was great just to stroll round or sit in the garden on one side for lunch .,1
loved it and well worth doing the trip up for only $ 17 .,1
getting down takes a bit more .,1
all enjoyed it so very much .,1
"if you 're really lucky , like we were , we saw an amazing light display .",1
"other than it being a huge tourist trap , i found the tower to be quite beautiful , especially after the sun went down .",1
the night boat fly is a perfect fairytale for our anniversary .,1
fantastic place .,1
stunning and a must see for sure when you are in paris !,1
"we pre paid and went to the summit , both of which i recommend .",1
"from there we just had to buy a ticket to the top and in less than half an hour since the beginning of the visit , we were on top of the breeathtaking tower .",1
"superb , monumentally mind blowing .",1
the base and the first floor are enough .,1
it 's paris and probably the most known attraction .,1
we saw it on the hop on/hop off bus day one and the seine river cruise that same evening .,1
i 've visited the tower by day and night .,1
"for me , nothing but media hype , from movies , to travel ads to a whole lot of other media avenues romanticising locationsstraight into your bucket list , and if some of you will be honest , thats it for you too .",1
you can not visit paris without seeing this iconic structure .,1
in paris you must go .,1
here you can gaze at the tower from the steps and the viewing platform and take in uninterrupted images of the entire tower with sweeping views of its surrounding area .,1
we could see for miles and the extra effort and cost to go right to the top is a must .,1
good experience .,1
you have to go twice .,1
it is also a spectacular place to see the whole paris but to do that you have to go up y elevator or on foot ... which means many steps up the stairs .,1
a few years ago i was too apprehensive about how a i would handle my fear of heights to wait in the 2.5 hour queue to go up .,1
we were rather confused at the train station and people would walk by without concern .,1
i definitely recommend going up the tower during the daytime .,1
it 's a non negotiable thing !,1
i love even seeing it from the grounds - but going up has its own charm .,1
you definitely ca n't avoid this if you travel to paris .,1
i 've been to the eiffel tower a couple of times but this was my first visit at night .,1
most tours were sold out a month in advance so either book ahead of time which is difficult with weather or wait 2 hours day of .,1
"it only cost 6 euros each more , and was def worth it .",1
"i went to see it twice , by day and by night , definitively worth it to enjoy both aspects .",1
we arrived at the trocadero late afternoon to watch the sun going down and the lights on the tower come on .,1
"yes , the views are amazing and they look better from the summit of eiffel tower than tour montparnasse which i also went .",1
at night it 's great for scenic photos and during the day to take pics with it/have lunch at and climb .,1
"there are two levels , a first level where you pay 11 euros full adult fare and top level where you pay 17 $ .",1
it was a lovely summer day and the queue was a nightmare !,1
that being said the tower is a wonderful attraction .,1
we were at the top of the tower by 10.15 am .,1
we absolutely loved the view and the vive of this place .,1
you really need to see this for yourself .,1
after you have purchased the overprice tickets you will realize that the view is nothing special and you are crammed like sardines -lrb- every major city in the world has office towers taller than this tower -rrb- .,1
great views from iconic structure .,1
enjoyed going to the top on our last trip .,1
one of my most memorable memory .,1
"i , personally , ca n't stand crowded touring points so i 'm not even thinking of waiting for something more than 15-20 minutes .",1
was only approached once by a young woman with a clip board -lrb- avoid this pick pocket tactic ... -rrb- .,1
having visited the eiffil tower on a number of occasions i find that if your go half an hour before dusk and stay awhile you will see the wonderful sights in both daylight and dark .,1
seeing the et in person is simply amazing .,1
very nice view .,1
it is a must see if you are in paris .,1
i always wanted to visit the eiffel tower and i had very high expectations and i hoped they would live up to it and it certainly did !!,1
i do n't have to write anything to say that this probably would be the one of the best experiences ever .,1
our mistake ?,1
the eiffel tower is wonderful !,1
"security is tight here so if you have anything that you would n't take on a plane , do n't take it here .",1
this iconic structure must be seen at night .,1
it transforms into a masterpiece of art .,1
it lives up to everything when it is lit .,1
"one of the special iconic places in the world , a must to see .",1
view views views !,1
the views of the city were so impressive that you forget about the queues .,1
they have added a security fence since the last time i was here in 2015 .,1
cup of mulled wine to keep me warm .,1
great view from the 2nd level .,1
"i have been there a few times , and everytime is as breath taking as before .",1
you do n't have to go up to be inspired by the immensity it presents .,1
i bought the groupon for the eiffel tower experience by night for 2 -lrb- $ 30 -rrb- and used it on 12/26 .,1
equally enjoying was the descent from the top level .,1
no cafes or bistros on the ground apart from a dodgy ` road-side ' cafe .,1
bought our tickets on site and went to the top quickly .,1
"i had lost my paper euro 's in the louvre and we only had 28 euros between us to get lunch , go up the eiffel tower and ...",1
we went on our honeymoon years ago .,1
"this is one reason to visit paris , it is still magnificent , and the views are spectacular .",1
the views of paris are great from the top though .,1
it did n't help that our hotel room had the tower framed by the window so that we could not avoid it .,1
we went at 2pm and basically walked in with our reservation .,1
but the tower is beautiful .,1
be sure to get this on video .,1
do n't get me wrong it 's impressive but the city has such an overwhelming wealth of history that the tower is an afterthought .,1
great to see the tower we tried to visit a day opened to the top but had to be satisfied to second story because of weather great view of paris,1
it was just as cheesy and amazing in person as it was in all the movies .,1
the best views across the city it really is stunning .,1
a must see attraction if you are going to paris .,1
we were stuck there for around 15 minutes before someone finally came to unlock it and let us through .,1
just an ice cream walking underneath the magnificent structure was fine for us .,1
an absolute must if you are so in love ...,1
i am not going to be adding much considering that by now it must have been reviewed thousands of times .,1
"if you dress like you are going to work in a nice office , they 'll leave you alone .",1
the structure is fascinating and the views even better .,1
"we were initially hesitant to spend $ 17 to go to the top as it seemed excessive , but in the end we were so glad we did !",1
only downside is you must be firm in saying no to people selling plastic miniature eiffel tower statues as they stand at the exit gates .,1
have more time ??,1
we got to have lunch in the 58 restaurant - delicious !,1
do n't take anything from anyone or they will expect you to pay for it .,1
be sure to take many pictures as this is a memory you never want to forget .,1
bit we enjoyed the atmosphere and really got to see all of paris without a problem .,1
"wait for a sunny day to get the best views of paris , go all the way to the top deck .",1
well worth paying for tickets to jump queue and combine with louvre and trip on boat down seine to save money and time .,1
i guess large crowds are to be expected at one of the most iconic monuments in paris .,1
it was raining and had a great time anyway .,1
"it a engineering marvel , after long wait , in the que , once u reach the summit , the wait is worth it , patience is a virtue .",1
people had scared us that if we do not have any advance booking then it would be just impossible to get tickets for summit -lrb- top -rrb- visit .,1
"with reservations , we were able to go right into line and got right into the cable car for the ride to the 2nd level .",1
we also stayed for 30 mins on the second floor with the guide and she gave us some information and tips .,1
watching the sunset on the second deck of the eiffel tower is something that should not be miss .,1
book the lift tickets in advance online before arrival .,1
"do visit during the day but my recommendation is also to take a boat tour with your significant other and see the eiffel tower at night , with its lights on .",1
as a tourist viewing the city it gives you ideas of where you 'd like to go and what you 'd like to see when you return to the ground .,1
"bring a jacket , lots and lots of wind , also go in he afternoon before it gets dark the pictures are amazing and the ones of the city iluminated are wow",1
the tower is notorious for its pickpockets .,1
"there are n't quite words to describe what it feels like to get that first real glimpse ... having seen photos since i was a child , seeing on tv and other people 's visits , i just did n't expect it to hit me like it did .",1
must see when you visit paris !,1
paris is incomplete without this .,1
"loved this , it was great !",1
"stunning tower , it is not the highest tower in the world or in europe itself but it is the most stunning one , the style is different than others , you will see metal accumulated together to end with eiffel tower .",1
"however , for me , the view that has stayed is not from the top but of a lit up eiffel from trocadero .",1
"we got daylight , saw sunset as we drank champagne at the summit .",1
"this was by third time up , this time with my family and will always be a wonderful memory for us !",1
an absolute must do in paris and i would go at night for dramatic effect of the beautiful lights .,1
"i am not a fan of enclosed spaces and did n't want to take the elevator , so we walked up to the second level .",1
"of course the view is great during the day time , but its awesome at night .",1
you absolutely can not visit paris without see this !,1
"amazing view , you can see everything ... must try the dinner at 58 restaurant , it is superb .",1
"the iconic structure that have drawn millions across the world , he eiffel tower , stands tall in the heart of paris .",1
"i would say it was a such an amazing experience , do n't miss it .",1
the staff are incredibly helpful .,1
we went when the que was n't long .,1
but with support of friends boarded the first lift .,1
not only was this very informative but it saved us us a lot of time as we skipped the queue .,1
omg what an amazing views from the top !!!,1
go and experience it .,1
view from the top is really good at night time when you can see the beautiful city lights over paris .,1
"always brilliant to see , tonight it was lit up on the hour - stunning such an iconic sight it never disappoints do n't miss this when in paris",1
will definately go back and see at night .,1
it was so beautiful we could n't take our eyes off of it .,1
i arrived to the eiffel tower around 4 p.m. and waited around until the lights were turned on .,1
the lines to go up were still very long and we were too tired to climb up to the lower viewing deck .,1
i had a perfect view from the window .,1
what do you expect ?,1
it 's the eiffel tower in paris .,1
"what is there to say , i lived next to the `` eye-full '' for 20 years every day it was a delight ... good weather , bad weather ... night or day , always there being beautiful .",1
it is breathtaking in size and the treasures it holds .,1
it s the most beautiful in the evening .,1
of course you can not go wrong with the eiffel tower .,1
"be careful walking under to tower because , believe it or not , people who are at the top appear to spit at the people on the ground down below , saw evidence of it and it disgusted all of us so we steered clear .",1
always a top place to visit when in paris .,1
"went to the top of the eiffel tower for 17 euros , amazing view at night and when its lights up it was amazing , great end to our stay .",1
you need to pick your day and time -lrb- the same requirement as with the tour operators -rrb- and print out your own ticket .,1
amazing a night and great picture opportunities .,1
we travelled out of season and still found the temperature perfect for sightseeing .,1
"for a little euro17 .00 your dream will come to ,",1
: d,1
"line to get tickets , line for security , line for the first elevator , line for the second elevator , etc. .",1
"you visit it more , more you want to go back to refresh the remarkable memories !",1
beautiful and a grand man made structure .,1
"once you have fought your way through the souvenir vendors and queued for an hour or so , both on the ground and then on level 2 for the lift to the top , the views are amazing .",1
after lunch we chose 2 walk up the stairs to the second level for wonderful views of the city .,1
it gives unobstructed view of the paris city from its 2nd or 3rd level,1
we took the fat tire seine river tour plus eiffel tower which was really nice as we got to see the twinkling of the lights as they start to turn on the lights at 9 pm which was truly amazing .,1
"this was a great place to visit and we are glad that we purchased skip the line tickets , it was well worth being able to bypass the long line ups .",1
eat across the street.i wish now i had gone up .,1
we got into the lobby right away but from that point we were in a queu line each step of the way .,1
it 's a bucket list icon .,1
"i would recommend going up the tower if you can , the view is definitely worth it .",1
-lrb- must by in advance online -rrb- .,1
"it will cost you something like 17 euros , and you can buy the tickets online which might save you a bit of time spent it the queues .",1
we were there at before sunset and stayed til it was dark - best time to do it i think .,1
utilize your time wisely .,1
"anyone dreaming of trip to europe would always want to go paris and see the famous eiffel tower , its like a dream come true for me , it is the most visited site in europe , people are everywhere day and night around this area , some enjoy seating on the grass people watching while drinking champagne sold by south asian vendors , many lovers taking kissing photo as they say its the city of love , there are shops selling quick meals , there are two carousel for children and adults , the queue to climb the tower is always very long , what we did is to climb the tower at 9pm were line is much shorter , fee is $ 9 for the 2nd level while the top is $ 15 but it was closed , it was windy and cold up the 2nd level but the view of paris at night from the eiffel tower is simply magical , next time i visit paris i will climb during day time to see the panoramic day scene .",1
take time to explore this tower from each corner .,1
visited here with my daughter and partner in july .,1
"if you are really keen in going up , buy tickets well in advance .",1
"arriving on a saturday is not a good idea unless you do n't intend to go up the tower , as queues indicated at least an hour to wait for a lift , and over 30 minutes to walk up .",1
spectacular view and architecture but the french people were very rude and vain they will not talk to if u ca n't speak french .,1
this landmark should not need any recommendations at night a spectacular sight from father away and the view from the terrace is breathtaking,1
omg of course this is a must see .,1
go with your eyes open and you wo n't be disappointed .,1
this is truly the best time to see and visit the tower .,1
the eiffel tower is one of the most well known monuments in the world .,1
we missed getting tickets in advance online but heard that it 's best to wait til you arrive to see how the weather is on the day you want to visit .,1
best to book a ticket online and so avoid the queues .,1
it has lots of over priced tourist shops on the floors so you can purchase your souvenir tat .,1
go see it at night in all its splendor .,1
"personally we prefer to travel to the trocadero metro stop and then you literally climb up the steps , walk around the corner and you are facing this magnificent sight .",1
as i 'm terrified of heights i did n't think id like this at all - but i loved it !!,1
it was also very windy at the queue so warm and windproof clothes are a must .,1
the area around where people picnic is littered with garbage .,1
"if you choose to go up in the tower , purchase tickets online ahead of time to avoid the long wait lines .",1
"worth seeing , although very busy around and no public toilets .",1
long waits to get through two lots of security then to wait for the lift .,1
it 's a great way to see paris .,1
magnificient construction and super great view from the top .,1
that allowed us more time to spend in the eiffel tower .,1
"even still , the eiffel tower is very impressive and a sight to behold .",1
the tower is absolutely enormous .,1
some of the family went to the summit -lrb- brace -rrb- others stayed on level 2 .,1
booked an evening group to the second level .,1
the night view is just breathtaking .,1
there is also queue for security check prior to entering the tower compound .,1
visiting eiffel was on my my bucket list for years and it was like dream come true for me .,1
may not be appropriate for children !,1
"where you used to be able to just walk up to the tower area and walk around , now the entire area is enclosed w/fencing .",1
next time it will be to the top floor !!!,1
and just as iconic .,1
would recommend getting skip the line tickets in advance .,1
we were worried as we had n't pre booked tickets and the euros were on so paris was quite busy .,1
and save yourself of the pain .,1
"is is a fantastic feat of engineering , and only sways 9cm in high winds .",1
we went after sunset and had to wait almost no time to go to the top .,1
"we toured at night and we were unable to take clear photos , so if that is something important to you , i would go during the day .",1
very crowded though .,1
"but even online tickets are going for dates a month later , so if you 're sure of your dates do get them online .",1
returned a few days later to see it in its nighttime splendor .,1
unfortunately we could n't go to the very top as you had to have reserved ahead .,1
"it 's obvious that going up into the eiffel tower is one of those bucket-list type activities , and it truly does not disappoint .",1
we opted for an early morning slot at 9.30 which had its pro and cons .,1
helpful security guards pointed us in the right direction to where we needed to be running to .,1
definitely get a lift ticket which secures an exact day and time .,1
how can you better this ?,1
good stuff .,1
waited my whole life for this .,1
"i was not one feeling like i had to visit the eiffel tower in my life time however , after being there i appreciate the simple aspect of enjoying the moment in such an amazing place .",1
we skipped the que and got the lift up with around 20 other people .,1
the tour of the tower was fantastic .,1
we ended up not going to the top for the line was an hour and a half wait in the full sun .,1
yay !,1
we booked a ticket for 8pm so that by the time we arrived at the top we had some daylight then enjoyed the sunset and the lights of paris .,1
you will be glad you did !,1
"plus , a fence keeps you secure .",1
easy to walk up if keen .,1
that 's an absolute must !,1
we saw the tower at 11pm and it was lit up for 5 minutes .,1
took a picnic down and sat on a grassed area until sunset .,1
"great view , that you must see while in paris .",1
"there are reduced rates for younger people , under 25/students , which was cool .",1
the eiffel tower is a rare thing : a world-famous place worthy of its reputation .,1
the prices are fairly reasonable for one of the most famous landmarks in the world .,1
"it is huge , it was bigger than i expected .",1
booked a skip the line eiffel tower with summit access tour with fat tire that started at 7.45 pm .,1
"however , worth visiting if you happen to be in paris .",1
when we came down the line to go up was very long .,1
it 's nice to take the boat tour down the seine river and see the tower from different angles and without crowds .,1
what 's to say ?,1
one could wait the long lines to ride to the top but my travel companion and i chose not to .,1
however when you do get to the summit it is a glassed-in enclosed space so even the nervous will enjoy and the ride down is no problem at all .,1
if you are travelling during a busy time use a tour guide to skip the queues .,1
usually the waiting times to get in the lifts are about 45 min up to 1.5 hrs depending on the day visiting .,1
"from the hotel , we got on our tour bus and took a short drive to the eiffel tower .",1
this was our second attempt at climbing -lrb- closed due to strike on tuesday ! -rrb-,1
it was simply a dream come true and i could look at it for hours .,1
the tour eiffel is one of the places you must see in paris on a first visit .,1
what can you say ?,1
it was so magical !,1
"dont miss 3rd summit ... exciting , thrilling , chilling and guess what not .",1
"i can understand why there were so many intellectual negatives about the towers incongruity to the rest of civilized paris when she was being built but the french have always manage to be a bit avant garde even by accident , and sometimes they get away with it .",1
"to say that i was there , to say tht i saw it up close and to say that i saw paris from the top will forever be et he 'd in my memories .",1
everything about the eiffel tower is incredible .,1
visiting this site in winter was the winner !,1
it must have been very hard to build such a massive architecture in such a short period even with today 's technology .,1
"at night is something , i never thought i will get .",1
it was a wish come true .,1
"yes , its a pain to line-up and go up the tower , but the view of paris from all directions is worth it .",1
it was fantastic .,1
we looked this tower from far and close too .,1
i am not really sure that there is much i can say about eiffel tower that has n't been said before .,1
just seemed like we had to go there before heading home for the evening .,1
anyway a lot of paris is not much to look at but i mean the eiffel tower could maybe be more of an experience with your lover .,1
the summit was windy but amazing .,1
one of the best views i had ever had - you can see the city and learn about mr. eiffel and his daughter 's life .,1
as we had a toddler with us we did not go up but the next time we will as it is a great view of paris from there -lrb- did this a few times over the years -rrb- .,1
"even in the elevators , every staff member we saw was texting or using their cell phones and not checking guests were fully in the elevator before closing the doors .",1
you ca n't visit paris without visiting the eiffel tower !,1
you 'll also see lots of looky looky men trying to get you to purchase items .,1
in winters need to have really good jacket with a hood to cover yr ears n head as its real chilly winds .,1
and historic .,1
unfortunately did n't have enough time to wait in line to get to the top and i did have my purse stolen by romas but that is no reflection on paris .,1
"our trip was a short one and so very limited were our options ; but however lesser time that we got , we decided never to miss this historical monument .",1
so many people waiting to go up there !!!!,1
i traveled with my family who were all fearful of going straight to the top of the et .,1
if there is a line it is worth the wait .,1
it is an amazing piece of history to see and photograph .,1
i was worth the long line and wait in the freezing cold .,1
"we went on christmas day , which was supposed to be low crowds , but it was insanely crowded .",1
"then they take you to the middle floor where you can have 2 glasses for $ 15,00 .",1
there 's a nice park behind the tower and you can escape the crowds and sit on a bench with some coffee or hot chocolate and just enjoy the scenery .,1
all of the security at major attractions in paris have been during the day .,1
the eiffel tower is a paris icon and of course on one 's `` must see '' list for the city .,1
"needless to say that the eiffel tower is a must visit when ur in paris , at least once .",1
went up the eiffel tower at nighttime when it lit up and was absolutely stunning .,1
i was there yesterday and i simply adored it .,1
"however even from this point we took beautiful photos , purchased great gifts at regular prices .",1
i visited the eiffel tower as a child and the queues seemed a lifetime - on this occasion we got to the tower at 9am and where 4th in the line to climb the stairs .,1
loved seeing eiffel 's little apartment at the top ...,1
it was spectacular and visible from most of the tourist paris area but when you are close to it on the plaza it is breathtaking .,1
eiffel always takes our breath away .,1
came back & took amazing pictures at night,1
this company just walks you through the door and nothing else .,1
i had thought it was just a big tower and then i saw it and it truly is amazing .,1
"once you get to the top , the view is amazing .",1
it is a sight to behold .,1
visited the eiffel tower 1st april 2015 and wow just was wow .,1
we took the tour to the top level and were delighted to have clear views across paris .,1
we had lunch at the toee .,1
and do n't just stand at the bottom and look up .,1
we went up with the lift and down by the stairs but i reackon going up climbing the stairs would make the experience even more beautiful !,1
dont forget to catch the tower light show at 9pm .,1
nice views of paris .,1
eiffel tower key rings 1.00 euro but as low as .40 euro elsewhere .,1
eiffel tower on my list of places to visit in paris .,1
the queues are long and the day we were there it was too busy to go to the very top but we still loved it .,1
my son loved walking down from the second floor .,1
watch the glittering lights on the top of the hour from trocadero .,1
the views are beautiful but not worse the long lines .,1
the elevator takes you to the second floor where you need to get into another line for the third -lrb- top -rrb- floor .,1
"i went to paris with my husband and 8yo daughter for spring break , and tour eiffel was at the top of my daughter 's agenda .",1
"we got there 20-30 minutes prior to opening , and the wait was tolerable .",1
you need to visit the top an is you are with someone special they sell champagne .,1
"everytime i go to paris , the eiffel tower is a must visit .",1
it is something that all tourists do and would be silly not to go up .,1
i highly recommend a visit .,1
the tower shows her many faces and moods - all beautiful in their own right .,1
the next day we went past about 2pm much better .,1
absolutely stunning views from the top .,1
security was tight as expected .,1
i would recommend seeing the tower from trocadero .,1
no trip to paris is complete without a trip to the eiffel tower !,1
its just iron which has reddish color and looks bad .,1
beautiful structure and worth a visit .,1
the light show at night is spectacular and has to be seen from the trocadero .,1
"went up this a while back and the views are stunning , if you plan to go then going up the tower is a must make sure that you leave yourself a couple of days in case the clouds are low and the weather is bad .",1
you can walk underneath eiffel tower and along the paths so you get a good viewing of it from all angles .,1
a lot of visitors and very tight security before entering the eiffel tower .,1
"you can see sacre-coeur , trocadero , seine , all paris in 360 ° .",1
"it may be the ultimate touristy thing to do , but i have to admit , taking the elevator to the top of the eiffel tower was very cool , and the views are absolutely breathtaking .",1
one ca n't imagine how incredible it is until you see it in person -- especially with the twinkling lights in the evening .,1
so maybe if you want to go up get pre-tickets online and hope it ai n't a foggy day .,1
there are restaurants on the top level of the tower for you to eat there and also on the bottom of the tower so you can eat while queuing up to go into the lift that brings you up the tower .,1
"we had trouble finding our way on the metro , so we called to let the guide know we would be late and to ask if there was way to meet them at the security entrance .",1
i was only in paris 2 days .,1
we paid for a tour which meant no queuing and a interesting commentary .,1
note that it only last a few minutes so get your camera ready by your side .,1
the queues to walk up the steps took an hour .,1
to me the area was very dirty and run down .,1
there is currently some building on the green so could n't sit on the grass area .,1
the magic thing was to be up there both in daylight and then in the dark with all the lights both in the eiffel tower and around in the city .,1
"bought tickets in advance , but when we showed up at 5:30 pm .",1
be careful of all the hustling sales guys .,1
"however , as soon as evening arrived , eiffel tower transformed into a completely different thing .",1
you spend so much time in line that by time you get to the top you fight through crowd to get one decent photo and get out because it is so crowded .,1
we first saw the eiffel tower on a bus tour of city lights .,1
the whole tower sparkles on the hour so make sure you plan to see it from across the street and from the tower when it does .,1
we recently booked to go to eiffel tower .,1
especially in the night whet the clock hits `` o'clock '' and the white lights starts blinking,1
but not nearly as long as it can get if you arrive after 09:00 am !,1
"half the family decided we 'd go up but after having gone to montmartre , the sacré cœur , then climbing the arc de triomphe , the lift to the summit was the only way to go !",1
"if you have ever been to the las vegas strip on a saturday night , fought through the porn-hawkers , the shady vendors , drunken groups of woo-girls , and sidewalks with almost no room to walk , then you 've had a more pleasant experience than going to the eiffel tower .",1
i hope we will come back again !,1
"we thought we might visit quickly since we had already visited the arabic institute , tour montparnasse and the terrace in the lafayette shopping mall to catch the views .",1
the beauty of the tower is even more exquisite after the sun goes down and the beauty of the twinkling lights sparkle over the city .,1
and i have a very nice and good time there with family ... thank you so much,1
it 's 13 $ for a glass .,1
i booked on-line for tickets at 8 pm to watch the sunset .,1
the weather was perfect the day we were at the eiffel tower .,1
we did it anyway .,1
3 emails back and forth later they would not give me my money back .,1
"its not to far from the louve we took the open top bus , but after day 2 we walked everywhere as everything was close",1
"sad , sad , sad for the icon of paris to have become such a circus .",1
"the queues are terrible , tickets are too expensive .",1
"an easy stair climb to the second level , where the sights are spectacular .",1
busy busy bit a definate must see.take your time and explore the area well .,1
just fyi - last visit we were able to freely walk under and around .,1
"we visited in aug 2016 and there was turnstyle security , checking bags etc. and military security on patrol around the tower .",1
"absolutely breathtaking at night , with the light display .",1
the glass top level was also cool .,1
"you have to see it in the day and late at night , go with someone you love .",1
the views the people .,1
great views and must use the toilets !,1
buy tickets early and go all the way up to the top for a champagne toast -lrb- at cost -rrb- .,1
we purchased tickets so that we could go all the way up to the summit of the tower .,1
they will stampede away if police are spotted .,1
first we booked a tour through paris wonders 2 weeks in advance .,1
so word of advice to visit eiffel tower is,1
so glad i made it to the top !,1
lights came on at 10p .,1
you have to queue at every stage .,1
do n't try and walk it .,1
"instead of going all the way to the top , just take the stairs to the first level -lrb- there are 3 levels -rrb- there is a little bar on the first level and it does krafts of wine at very decent prices , nice experience !",1
paris is definitely the city of lights .,1
pm the waiting time to get to the second floor is only 30 min .,1
buy tickets in advance to avoid an hour long queue .,1
we chose 3:30 pm on a monday .,1
the 2nd floor does have spectacular views-even though it was cloudy - it was still amazing .,1
it is also very nice to walk a long the river side of tour eiffel,1
book ahead online to get a summit pass to go to the top and for less line up time .,1
it was quite inexpensive to go to the highest vantage point and the views were magnificent .,1
"we took pictures from the tower , under the tower looking up and around the tower .",1
see the lights flicker at 10 and 11 pm for 5 min and pay the ghastly -lrb- $ 15 if purchased ahead or with a passlib pass -rrb- $ 17 for the ride to the summit -lrb- last ride up at 11 pm -rrb- .,1
if you do n't like queueing then buy a ticket in advance as the queues can be horrendous .,1
a few tips ... book ahead as they suggest .,1
the lines were waaaay too long we visited during the day and at night .,1
i am so glad we did !,1
"two men wrapped a woven bracelet around both our wrists saying it was good luck , and charged us 10 euros each .",1
the observation post at the top was nothing special .,1
"we made our way directly to the queue for the summit of the tower to start , and we were glad we did .",1
my wife and i found the best spot to look at it was actually across the river sitting at the jardins du trocadero .,1
a visit to paris is incomplete without a visit to this iconic monument .,1
book your tickets in advance if you are going to visit .,1
"the lifts are roomy , and fit a lot of people in .",1
went to visit in may 2014 not 15 .,1
the 2nd level has a gift shop and is surrounded by places to over look paris .,1
the 3rd level -lrb- the summit -rrb- is located on the very tip top !,1
you need to get here for when they open or you 'll be stuck in massive queues .,1
i went at night on feb. 29th and the line was long and it was cold/windy .,1
"i have already seen this wonder thrice and if i have to , i will go again ... i love to see it with or without lights .",1
last enjoy !,1
was top of the list for paris and did n't disappoint .,1
my battery died just as i had reached the top !,1
"elevators were full so we walked down 2 stories , dumb idea , bigger walk then we thought .",1
and obviously you should go .,1
choose a nice weather day without wind and enjoy the monument and the view .,1
good way to orient yourself in the city .,1
"the eiffel macron tower was a delight to see , the ice skating rink was such a beautiful winter touch .",1
stayed at mercure paris centre ; 5mins walk to eiffel tower .,1
ice skating on the 1st level .,1
"we arrived around noon on a tuesday and already , the area was packed .",1
you can take pictures of this tower in different angles .,1
you cana even climb it but with a price .,1
of course .,1
overall great experience .,1
"still be prepared for a crowd , but the views are well worth it .",1
visited paris just to see the eiffel and loved every bit of the experience .,1
we started our ascent just as the sun was setting and saw paris transition from day to night !,1
get your tickets before hands to avoid wasting time in line .,1
as soon as i arrived in paris i could see the eiffel tower it was dark an the lights where on i was in awe at how beautiful it is .,1
it is one of the things that one has to see in paris .,1
i saved my visit to the eiffel tower for the last day of my visit to paris and i was not disappointed .,1
fr .,1
after getting our tickets we took the elevator to the top and there was a great view of the city .,1
"be prepared , its windy outside at the top .",1
over the years we have gone up on the elevator four times and it 's still thrilling to look over the city below .,1
amazing experience to see the gigantic architecture .,1
we had an 8 yr old and a 2 year old with us .,1
"we queued less than hour to get in , more queues for lifts on different levels , but not too bad.you can walk up to lower levels to beat queues .",1
"built to be torn down at the end of the 1889 world 's fair , the eiffel tower is , of course , the signature of paris .",1
a must-see place if you go to paris .,1
now it 's my wife .,1
one of the best places to visit in paris .,1
so we had no choice but to view the magnificent tower from the bottom as i had a bad knee and could n't make my way up the steps .,1
they should really have free parking .,1
"oh , well , it is their country , i suppose .",1
the cost was very reasonable do not think it is worth paying the fast-track cost as all moved along well .,1
"at the second platform , you can buy reduced tickets to take the elevator to the top .",1
"you will pay 7 eur to take the stairs to 2nd deck , about 300 total .",1
"if it was a nicer day and we did n't have so much stuff , i 'm sure it would n't have been such a big deal .",1
it is normally crowded so expect a wait .,1
the stair climb is n't nearly as bad as i was expecting .,1
we have our free time to walk around the area .,1
a wonderful place for families to share,1
very pricy stands for food drinks or souvenirs,1
make sure you purchase the light up tower as a memento .,1
"but , as the most visited place in paris it misses more bathrooms at the base .",1
we went up in the evening so the daylight lets you see the city .,1
loved it all,1
my husband and i got tickets in advance so that we had a set time to go up .,1
"when in the past you see the tower thru travel brochures , or featured in the travel documentaries - nothing came compare or prepare you at the sight of it in person .",1
go to the top if you are n't afraid of heights .,1
"however , getting the lift back down is a nightmare , beware .",1
the eiffel tower is visible all over paris and at night it is lit up in several spectacular ways .,1
we booked jump the que thtough viator but this only gets you to the second floor even though we booked to go to the top .,1
there was a bosnian woman that pretended to take donations for deaf and mute people .,1
"i think it was like 14 euros each to go to the `` sommit '' but was well worth it , amazing experience and truly romantic .",1
absolutely lovely .,1
"i have been to the 3 rd level of the eiffel tower several times , the views are breathtaking .",1
we went the next day as well but i think at night is where it 's at .,1
it does this every hour on the hour .,1
everything went fast and friendly .,1
check it is open before you go !,1
"its my first time in paris and maybe i had seen too much of the tower in the media , it is the most iconic symbol of paris so maybe i was expecting too much .",1
"the macarons on the second level are quite nice , but expensive -lrb- when compared to nicer patisseries -rrb- however , they can we worth the experience .",1
i am petrified of heights -lrb- ca n't even look down the stairs -rrb- yet i was determined to get up the eiffell tower !!,1
one could literally see entire paris from the top and man it 's beautiful .,1
"however , during this season the lawn in the back of the tower close and everywhere is wet .",1
the view at night over paris was amazing .,1
"monuments , museums , architecture , food n beverages are awesome .",1
"buy a bottle of champagne , a picnic blanket and watch the sunset and the lights turn on from the park .",1
the eiffel tower should not be missed !,1
lots of armed police/military patrolled the area which was comforting .,1
definitely recommended a visit,1
see paris from the top of the tower is amazing .,1
"dear paris , please give the eiffel the facelift it so desperately needs .",1
the queues to buy tickets is very long .,1
it is exactly as awesome as you think it will be .,1
i do not know if this is a duplicate or this is really the original statue .,1
do n't just go to the second level - going too the top is apart of the experience - it 's a must your there .,1
"there was also a vendor in the area selling prints of several paris sites , this made a wonderful souvenir that i really treasure .",1
view from the alexander bridge was just amazing !,1
you can see for miles .,1
lots of steps but definitely worth it when you get to the top,1
i had almost crossed going up the tower off my list .,1
lovely to gaze upon it from a distance .,1
then we went down to watch the sparks show .,1
"our teenage boys were determined to go to the top and thanks to these reasonably priced tickets , we could time our entry to 9.30 pm and were at the top of the tower by the time the sun went down and the lights came on and started flashing at 10pm - a really memorable experience .",1
"was only suppose to be erected for six months , but it brought in so much money , they kept it , thank goodness .",1
"beautiful structure and definitely worth a visit , easy to find and lots to do in surrounding area , beautiful at night",1
as long as you are properly dressed and have a good umbrella .,1
my husband and i enjoyed a lovely glass of champagne .,1
"we booked a wonderful `` skip the line : eiffel tower by night tour '' through viator.com and had an amazing time with a great tourguide who gave interesting , relevant information and got to stay on the eiffel tower until it closed after the tour , not having queued for evern 5 minutes in total .",1
"if you want to go up , and do n't have a reserved time ticket , arrive 30-45 minutes before it opens in the morning to beat the long lines -lrb- and the tour buses -rrb- .",1
the time spent actually getting from 1st floor to top floor passes in no time at all .,1
lights are spectacular .,1
it was a great attraction .,1
"awesome views of paris , not to be missed even in the rain .",1
we only had 4 days here and knew the eiffel tower was on our must do list .,1
if you are visiting paris .,1
one of the most exotic structures seen .,1
we found eiffel tower so beautiful that again we visited during night that is after 9:30 pm .,1
the tower is beautiful from all angels of the city though so if its in your site ... its making you just be in awe of it .,1
we did not climb the tower because it did not seem to be worth the line .,1
it is very pretty when it is lit up .,1
"the easiest way to reach here is by metro,bir-hakeim is the nearest station from where it could be easily accessed .",1
this iconic tower is well worth a visit if only for the views it affords you over paris .,1
the ride to the top is so breathtaking and a feeling of being in a very historical place .,1
"views are so good up there , but it is a little windy , so take a scarf .",1
the eiffel tower is beautiful and it shines to all city ... really nice to be there !,1
eiffel tower is definetly one of must-do 's of paris .,1
"it left us speechless the first time we saw it and it does each time we visit paris.this time we took the lift to the 2nd viewing platform , that was breathtaking .",1
visited on a monday afternoon so was n't too busy .,1
i 've been to paris twice and was really excited to see the sparkling night time lights again the second time .,1
we walked to the tower to queue the line to go to the 2nd floor after taking a couple of photos in front of the tower .,1
we visited in march so it was a cool night .,1
we had prebooked tickets for 5.00 pm and could not go in before 5 mins to 5 .,1
everyone around the place gives it a lovely atmosphere .,1
not my cup of tea - but my husband enjoyed that part !!,1
"i imagine it 's glorious in the sunshine , but at least at this time of year it was n't crammed with people !!!",1
you will still want to see it in both to compare for yourself .,1
the lowest level is accessible by steps .,1
"taking in paris from it 's most famous landmark ; just a beautifully epic day , especially if a couple .",1
i suggest visit the tower during daylight and take a river cruise in the evening .,1
"well worth a visit , try to go at night , more impressive views over paris !",1
so we settled for seeing it from below .,1
"but it 's still worth doing and you can ask the guide questions , to draw out a bit more information .",1
my title says all .,1
take lots of pictures with eiffel tower on the background .,1
"if you are really into views and heights , this is your treat .",1
take some cash for the shop in the tower as you are bound to want to buy a souvenir .,1
"they do n't tell you , but that is not what they want you to do .",1
so awe inspiring and beautiful .,1
it is nice not only in the morning but also at night,1
would not have missed it for the world .,1
enjoy a glass of champagne while viewing the city at the summit .,1
it was my utmost desire to visit this tower once in my life .,1
they argue if you try to give back .,1
but not that bad .,1
we went up the 2nd floor .,1
there is one further level but in my opinion the second level has excellent views .,1
the first floor has some glass floors on it .,1
my wife and i visited the eiffel tower and opted for the behind the scenes guided tour .,1
it looks most amezing when lit up .,1
they are pretty expensive but we thought well worth it if you have limited time .,1
the view from the top is as wonderful as it is everywhere else is in the city of love .,1
"we did the walk up the first two stage which was exceptional , then caught the lift to the top .",1
the view from the top are incredible and you will be able to see all of paris .,1
just be firm with the ` no '',1
you will save time .,1
you ca n't go to paris without visiting the tower .,1
its a lifetime must see .,1
"if you can get past the queues that go on forever , the tower allows spectacular views of the city .",1
"my , it was beautiful and so very worth it .",1
"very busy , huge queues so best to book your tickets in advance and you need to watch out for pickpockets but the views from the top are spectacular .",1
"even though it is the most overused iconic portrait in the world , it is still fabulous , you have to see it up close to understand how big this thing really is .",1
"in my life , i have seen several buildings from him in aeveral places of the world including mexico : he was a real pioneer",1
this is an impressive structure .,1
that is the same thought about many of the attractions in paris !,1
but how can you visit paris without at least stopping by it 's most famous landmark ?,1
the line got quite a big longer by 9:00 am though when the gates opened .,1
it never loses its magic no matter how many times you see it !,1
it 's a must see but for me once should have been enough .,1
"go ahead , snap photos , do n't forget to go down and see the tower up close .",1
it 's not well organized at the base and people line up everywhere and not necessarily in the right place .,1
just looking at the tower from a distance make us feel soo happy .,1
"simply outstanding , if a little terrifying .",1
we took the trip to the top and it was well worth it .,1
however the views all around from our vantage point were excellent .,1
the lights are illuminated on the hour .,1
the charm never seems to dissipate .,1
we visited in feb out of season not much of a queue we visited at 5:15 and it went dark while we were up the tower .,1
we therefore got the best of both worlds and would recommend viewing at night,1
not for those afraid of heights but magnificent to see !,1
the lines to go to the top were insane .,1
a unique experience and a must-see if u visit paris .,1
had hot chocolate because it was cold out .,1
please note that our trip was in july 2014 but the option was not available in the drop down menu for when did you travel ?,1
an up-close view is even better .,1
it was iconic and fun .,1
other places i 've visited are much better maintained,1
"we queued to get tickets , which was only for about 20 mins or so .",1
the city looks amazing as the sun is setting and if you time it right you 'll see the city in daylight followed by the night .,1
"i do n't think that you need to go up or eat at the tower , just being there to see it is inspiring enough .",1
"in addition to this , you were continuously hassled by people on the side of the street and all around the tower half-heartedly trying to make a quick buck by selling cheap knockoffs .",1
it was our mistake we did not buy the tickets online or did paid for organized tour .,1
love seeing it and taking friends and family to visit .,1
"if you 're able , it 's well worth climbing the stairs , rather than taking the lift - the views of paris on the way up are well worth it and you can take all the time you need .",1
amazing views from all angles of paris .,1
"if you show a student card or if you are younger than 24 you get a cheaper rate otherwise it is $ 11 to go to the 2nd floor , which is really reasonable .",1
we did go there but the view is endless from the second level .,1
quintessential paris landmark .,1
free toilets -lrb- portaloo 's -rrb- are inside the compound and are disgusting !,1
the views were amazing and the ride up and down were efficient .,1
the eiffel tower by itself is a masterpiece and as i approached it for the first time ... my heart skipped a beat .,1
take time to go up in the tower .,1
this gives you the luxury of entering through a shorter line and then getting to the gates for your trip to the top .,1
amazing value for money - try to go to the very top if brave enough but be prepared for the long wait for the lifts if you do go late at night ...,1
but .,1
from there it cost another 6 euro to take the lift to the top .,1
it is really amazing to see it .,1
omg i 'm so glad i did n't walk up them !,1
the part underneath the tower is fenced off this helps the pick pocket situation .,1
we then climbed up the stairs to level 2 .,1
we visited 2nd floor by stairs at night and it is must to do one time experience .,1
"this structure , which initially was not happily embraced , has come to represent paris and perhaps france .",1
i have been here 5 years ago but this monument never seize to amaze .,1
"the is an airport like security check before you get in the first lift -lrb- no water bottles or empty bottles , forks , sharps etc -rrb- .",1
"the large plaza was almost empty , the view spectacular .",1
all this took place on a perfect night under a full moon .,1
"we went around 7:45 pm so the queue was n't too bad , in fact we only had to wait like 5min .",1
stood in another security line for 10-15 minutes for the first lift .,1
we did n't go up this time but we enjoyed visiting and walking around and taking some more pictures .,1
especially sun raise of sun set is great answer not so busy .,1
the views from the 2nd floor are just as lovely without queueing for the lift .,1
"a mythical and audacious sight , it has always inspired artists and challenges .",1
"david at fat tire tours , gave us a wonderful tour to the eiffel tour .",1
"no , this is paris ' symbol , maybe france 's most popular one .",1
"the tour eiffel has to be on your list of sights to visit on a trip to paris , it 's a grand example of wrought iron construction .",1
whilst in paris we visited the eiffel tower twice.the first time was for dinnervat sunset ... great yo see the sun go down on this legendary city .,1
you can get advanced tickets and skip the ticket lineup but you have to book weeks in advance .,1
really is massive books can not justify the size and beauty .,1
"we have used the stairs , line was shorter and it 's amazing .",1
we tried to book tickets on line or at the hotel and they said it was sold out .,1
also head to the top right away as elevators get smaller for each level on way up .,1
nothing beats taking a selfie or a groupfie standing below the eiffel tower or posing far from it .,1
"also when going to the top going to level two is enough , the view from level two and the top is not very different .",1
we went to see the eiffel tower at night in may .,1
garden developed nearby is very beautiful .,1
paris does not look like `` paris '' without the eiffel tower -lrb- 巴黎鐵塔 -rrb- .,1
"glows like a beacon , n easily awestruck by its glow .",1
one should go to the third level of tower and the city looks great from there,1
"obviously , the tower is a must in paris .",1
day and night .,1
this time we took a walk in the park and sat on a bench like the locals and it was refreshing with the spring air !,1
i purchased stair access -lrb- it was quite busy and i did n't want to wait to go all the way to the top -rrb- .,1
"i 've wanted to see this landmark since i was a child , so it was a thrill !",1
the lifts up were packed and a piece of glass fell off on the outside due to the rain .,1
great for all ages !,1
the opulence was extreme and could easily see why there was the french revolution .,1
"i was never that crazy about going to see it or go to paris , but now i have to say i am glad she made me go :-rrb- we only went up to the first and second floor since it was include in the tour .",1
it was quite crowded .,1
"every time we passed by the tower we took a picture , had lunch on the 1st stop up , with our tour group .",1
this also gave us the satisfaction of making the trip up worth the fee charged to get in .,1
"there were also shops , food and a skating rink .",1
the queue for prepaid tickets -lrb- green -rrb- looked long but went very quickly .,1
absolutely gorgeous in the evening when the tower is lit up .,1
the view from the top is spectacular but the trip up there is quite scary !,1
the eiffel tower is to paris what the statue of liberty is to new york and what big ben is to london : the ultimate civic emblem .,1
view of the tower is beautiful in every angle .,1
"get there is really easy -lrb- by bus or metro -rrb- , the ticket price to get to the summit is 17 euros -lrb- higly recommended to go that high -rrb- .",1
by the time you walk up the tower you might have waited in the elevator line !,1
"as a disabled person i got a reduction and so did my friend who attended with me , thank you .",1
"for a first timer , its a wonder to behold especially knowing how old the tower is and the fact it was supposed to be temporary .",1
"lineups are long , so if you can buy tickets before hand , i would suggest doing that , although from what we found , you may have to book weeks in advance in some cases .",1
we went around 5pm and waited about an hour .,1
absolutely stunning from every angle and ca n't express how beautiful it is .,1
you can also access the second floor through the elevator -lrb- but be prepared to make long lines -rrb- .,1
great information on the building of the tower available .,1
in my opinion the view here is better than at the top of the notre dame .,1
"there was indeed a large security presence , but not so many visitors",1
i really liked the view .,1
nighttime is the best time to visit the eiffel tower .,1
print and present your ticket saves waiting in line.be sure to buy tickets that take you to the top .,1
it was more magnificent than i imagined .,1
this proved to be well worth while as the time in the queue was extensive .,1
the second day we got to the tower and the lines were outrageous .,1
lovely to see and experience a must when you visit paris lovely view from the top .,1
"i did n't know it sparkled , and the entire cruise erupted in cheers when it did .",1
we 'd pre booked the trip so had no choice but to go .,1
a snack in its restaurant on the top as you gaze far and wide remains etched in your memory forever .,1
make sure you have 3 + hours to blow before going all the way to the top .,1
best at night !!,1
"one must always visit the tower and gaze upon its graceful lines , you can take a boat and sail along the seine",1
i tried to book a tour in advance and a ` skip the line ticket ' but it was all booked out .,1
had to wait a while but well worth it !,1
this structure is absolutely fabulous .,1
staff just shrug when you ask why it is closed !,1
"when we got to the tower , i realised that we were too close to actually take a full blown pic of the tower and the family .",1
charge your camera before you go .,1
"for me ... walking under it , standing back and getting a great shot of it , and going at night to see it lit up abs sparkle would have been enough .",1
the eiffel tower was a must see .,1
the eiffel tower i probably liked the least due to pushy tourists .,1
we went at a busy time so ended up waiting the better part of an hour in the `` walk up '' line - as opposed to the `` elevator line '' .,1
you seriously can not go to paris without visiting the eiffel tower .,1
you have to queue on each floor to take lifts up/down .,1
"what an awesome experience while traveling to london , too the eurostar under tunnel train into paris .",1
we did n't partake of champagne once at the very top,1
the views were great from the 2nd level and we did not feel we missed out by not going to the top .,1
the line ups were horrendous .,1
"when the line opens , you pay 4 euros to climb to the second level and then buy your lift tix to the top there .",1
"during the short walk we were given the facts and figures of the eiffel tower , its conception , construction and current highlights .",1
"a must on any visitors list of things to do , when visiting paris , but a note of caution to would be travellers .",1
this is then repeated every hour .,1
every time you pass it tempts you to have a selfie ;-rrb- !,1
this way you can avoid extremely long queues -lrb- we queued for 2.5 hours -rrb- and just go along at your assigned time .,1
"we bought tickets online ahead of time , i know it 's hard but keep trying .",1
there was way to many street workers but ok at people got ta earn their bread .,1
you can see every single landform and unique city view .,1
take the stairs if u are young ... i assure u will get thru easily,1
"to get the perfecta view of this tower , take the metro to `` trocadero '' the station just above it .",1
"but then again , i ca n't complain .",1
always light but sparkles every hour after dark for 5 minutes .,1
"we were actually there about an hour before it opened for tourists , and there was a small line forming .",1
it was almost not worth the time,1
certainly not .,1
brilliant views of a beautiful city .,1
it does get a little breezy so make sure to have a sweater or jacket .,1
it was even more wonderful than my visit 25 years ago !,1
have to see it to believe it .,1
just realize that you will probably be fighting a crowd when you get to the top !,1
"still , my number 1 to do list in paris is to see this iconic landmark for which it is very well known for .",1
"just could n't get enough of seeing it from anywhere we were in paris , it was always a highlight to see it whether close up or from as far away as sacra coeur .",1
you really feel like history is all around you .,1
"we had pre-booked and so glad i did as lots of people queing , despite the mid december temperatures .",1
great !,1
really worth ride to the top .,1
"we signed up for the skip the line/eiffel summit tour for june 19th , 2016 for my friend 's birthday .",1
cost me around $ 22.50 for myself and my son for top floor which i found very good value for money .,1
book in advance and pay extra to jump the long queue,1
make sure you stand beneath it and look up !!,1
had dinner up here with my wife .,1
"we read everything on its history and the construction of the tower , went all the way to the top , enjoyed a glass of wine , laughed and took a lot of photos .",1
"was really unimpressed with the tower , it does not feel very large and it was tiresome to use .",1
"at night , it glows and shimmers with light show that 's hard to beat .",1
loved seeing the eiffel tower for my 1st time .,1
no other choices .,1
the night time boat ride is visually beautiful .,1
we bought skip the line tickets for a tour and trip to the summit .,1
nothing you see in pictures or magazines can prepare you for how you feel about it the first time you see it .,1
"we heard nothing from viator either and with less than 24 hours to our planned eiffel tower visit tomorrow , we have had to explain to our children why they ca n't go up the tower as we had planned and they have been so excited about .",1
you will love it !!,1
extremely romantic .,1
great view on paris and amazing journey to the top .,1
of course without any information !,1
everyone knows what the eiffel tower is - but when you see it in person you realise just how magnificent it is .,1
the tower itself from the outside is super wow !,1
the lines were not too long and the wait not too great .,1
despite arriving before us these people were still queuing when we came down from being at the top !,1
you might have to purchase a tour to get to the top like we did but for ten extra euros who cares ?,1
"go see it , and go to the top !",1
in the top you will see the beautiful paris .,1
"it is the most romantic view of paris , and all the history of the eiffel tower could be read at the top .",1
i saw flashing around the corner these lights and i thought there was an emergency .,1
order tickets on internet !,1
"the eiffel tower gives you different feels in the day time and at night , so i suggest you to go at dusk , so you can see its enormous structure before the sunset .",1
"the best place to take picture of the eiffel tower is honestly , from the pont du bir hakeim -lrb- that bridge in the inception movie -rrb- .",1
"avoid the dingy , overcrowded , pick-pocket threat of eiffel tower area .",1
you will sail right in past the disorganized masses who stand in line for tickets .,1
"expect lines and somewhat of a crush in the elevator to the 2nd level -lrb- top was closed the day i visited -rrb- , but the view is breathtaking .",1
you can ride the elevator or take the stairs part way up .,1
we decided to try our luck so we headed over to buy tickets .,1
first i the security check and then in the stairs or elevator to go up .,1
beautiful place so i have been told really want to go there one day hopefully my boyfriend with propose to me because that has always been my dream,1
policemen patrolled in packs throughout the property .,1
they had a large soccer ball hanging from it as the european cup was on .,1
is just amazing `` once in life '' place to see .,1
the summit -lrb- and second floor -rrb- allows for great views out across the city and one is able to get some great pics from the high vantage point .,1
you can no longer see g eiffel 's office .,1
"you could walk underneath , and it 's impressive to look at .",1
"it 's amazingly done and since we were there only during the day , the night lights would probably make this structure luminous and brightly lighted .",1
be sure to visit the tower area at night when it is lit up .,1
we went right to the top and skipped visiting the other levels till we were feast to go down .,1
not sure if we just got a great time to go but the lines were very short and we did n't have a long wait time for any of it .,1
the eiffel tower needs no introduction or in depth review .,1
"having been to the top of the eiffel tower many times it is essential to have a pre booked ticket or be with a tour , the view is sensational but so is the one from montpasse tower and not quite as crowded !!",1
"in these you will see the real ingenuity of artchitecture and art ; while the eiffel tower is , while nice , mostly popular because of its size and because it is an easy icon of paris due to its shape and size .",1
this is how we were introduced to eiffel tower by the tour guide and he was absolutely right .,1
it is difficult to believe this was made 125 years back .,1
we had lunch at the eiffel 58 restaurant and it was surprisingly good .,1
i was so looking forward to seeing this monument and then when i got there - i was n't wowed at all .,1
was a fun activity .,1
beautiful views !!,1
there are pickpocket warnings everywhere and our guide warned us of their scam to ask tourists to `` complete a survey '' while they distract you .,1
"during the day i would recommend , taking one of the skip-the-line tours .",1
day .,1
beware touts n be prepared to walk a lot,1
"usually this place is very crowded and packed with visitors , but when we arrived at the site we found it to be uncrowded and very short lines so we decided to go up .",1
"day or night , the eiffel tower is a fantastic landmark that you must visit when in paris .",1
the sun stays up pretty late in summer in paris ... like 9:00 -9:30 pm .,1
we went in the evening so it was getting chilly .,1
the eiffel tower is not pretty but the views from the top is absolutely fantastic !,1
"we went up on a blustery april day , and it was still packed .",1
the eiffel tower is worth the time and money it takes to get to the top-most platform .,1
"maybe due to the season - or maybe due to the threats to public safety , the area was very quiet .",1
it was an amazing experience !,1
beware ... .,1
could n't go up to the peak due to the wind but the 2nd floor was good enough .,1
the eiffel tower is as amazing in daylight but spectacular at night time -lrb- with the light show -rrb- .,1
"but if you 're afraid of heights , the first and second levels provide just as an amazing view of the city .",1
but i suggest you in the night !,1
eiffel tower is probably on your bucket list .,1
no trip to paris is complete without stopping by the eifel tower or viewing it from different places in the city .,1
the queues were big but worth it !,1
it just surprised me on a corner .,1
we would walk and walk and somehow we 'd end up here.everyday !,1
the process went very smoothly .,1
definitely worth it even if you do n't go up the tower just standing underneath it is an experience !,1
the meal ticket gave us priority access therefore we did not have to join the very long queue at the bottom for a lift ticket as it was already included .,1
and as the light dimmed the lights came on and that was another beautiful sight to see the eiffel tower lit up .,1
be wary of street vendors at the tower who try and sell you merchandise .,1
the imposing monument is a must visit .,1
"the most amazing part is - except for the dreamed picture with the tower on the background , there 's a free skating rink on the 2nd floor -lrb- during winter -rrb- .",1
"important : do n't bring too many valuables , and watch closely the ones you brought - full of pickpockets .",1
enjoy some time around the eiffel tower to soak up it 's true charm during the day and at night .,1
i highly suggest going at night when the lights are on .,1
"just walking up on it after seeing it in pictures and movies , was thrilling .",1
loved going to the eiffel tower !,1
only visited the second floor and the first -lrb- by taking the steps down - further than you think ! -rrb-,1
this is an amazing place to visit .,1
arrived early and bet most of the queues .,1
iconic & classy .,1
next time i will have a meal in the resturant .,1
surrounding grounds are great .,1
"looks beautiful from the tower or from the ground and when lit up is amazing , on the hour at night they do a bit of a light show which is fab !",1
"while it is harder to see the city from the top at night , the fact that the city is so illuminated made for fantastic views .",1
it is a real pleasure .,1
"we went at night and surely the towers are imposing with the lights on , especially .",1
a 15 minute wait for the upper level lift .,1
gives beautiful view of entire city .,1
"we had tried 2 months in advance to book an expensive tour that guaranteed being able to go up the tower , but was unable to do so and without that tour , we were not able to wait the 3 hours plus to get up as our time in paris was very limited .",1
beware of the pickpockets and be on your guard with the street sellers .,1
such an iconic place that every person should visit !,1
"i absolutely loved it but at the same time , it is only one time visit .",1
"however , also heed all the pickpocket warnings .",1
loved it - could not believe i was actually there in person looking at it and looking out from the observation deck !!,1
not too expensive but the queues can be an hour or two long .,1
50/50,1
spent about 3 hours up there and had a glass of wine on the first floor looking over the view .,1
of course this is the iconic symbol of paris and a must see .,1
so impressive especially when we walk through the stairs going up .,1
we booked the `` behind the scenes '' tour .,1
"impressive , very crowded though around the area .",1
i 'm not sure i 'd want to do it in july or august when the lines can become really long .,1
"of you have to get the lift , then def go early .",1
it was cheaper and there was absolutely no line at all .,1
this is an absolutely must see but not necessarily an absolutely must go up .,1
lighting at night is spectacular !,1
definitely a must-see !,1
glad we did it .,1
you ca n't go to paris without visiting the eiffel tower !,1
"prebooked only avoids part of the long wait at the bottom , everyone queues again at the second floor .",1
excellent day in paris .,1
buy your tickets before you go as the lines to buy tickets are long .,1
"during the day , you can go up to the tower for a price of approximately 15 euros and see all the city .",1
i enjoyed my visit to the eiffel tower .,1
my family and i spent nearly half of a glorious sunny spring day amongst all three levels of the eiffel tower .,1
my children were desperate to go up the tower and see the city from a height .,1
the line was n't horrible so we waited for tickets .,1
not enough public toilets -lrb- we actually saw a woman lower her pants and urinate on the grass -rrb- .,1
"you go to paris , you got ta see the eiffel tower .",1
i mean what 's there to say ?,1
i recommend going across the quai and down to the river 's edge where you can get a great photo with the eiffel tower 's reflection in the water .,1
"did n't go all the way to the top , but the view from the second level was amazing !",1
we stayed around the corner from the tower so it was convenient for new year 's eve celebrations .,1
i strongly recommend people to hire this visit using the partners of trip advisor .,1
after many years of going on about wanting to go up the eiffel tower i finally managed to accomplish it on a 3 day ` special ' birthday trip to paris in december .,1
"we lost money there , later realised that they use a sponge ball which they tactically hide so actually they are cheating money from toursists !",1
you should go there in the day to have a better view of the city .,1
"it was on our bucket list , but we have every intention of returning , but next time in the spring .",1
very crowded no matter when you go ... no surprise .,1
"well worth it , the views over paris are unbelievable .",1
you have a separate ticket line -lrb- green signs -rrb- to enter through security that is shorter and faster and you by pass the long lines to get up the eiffel tower .,1
go to the second floor and get an amazing view of the city .,1
i think that i was just completely lucky on the day i visited .,1
i could see two points of entry thru security sentries .,1
we got there about 5:30 on a sunday evening and walked right in .,1
in every angle and every combination this `` world wonder '' is simply amazing .,1
i think you should visit yes because it 's an icon world wide and if you happen to come then you should spend the extra # 6.00 to go up to the top !,1
"however , if there is fog or cloudiness it is n't worth to go up the eiffel tower as the view is limited .",1
its a must visit even if once while you are in paris :-rrb- do n't miss the night view,1
we had n't booked tickets in advance but only waited 10 minutes to buy them & get into the lift .,1
wonderful views brill visit .,1
now it the landmark most associated with paris by many .,1
we bought online and joined tour opposite to the effiewl .,1
"our tour only made a stop for pix on the grounds of the eiffel tower , so we decided to go back on our own .",1
beautiful view of paris as it was a super clear day when we went .,1
"of course it is the eiffel tower and all of us want to see it , to claim on it ...",1
"hope i ll be back with my mother , her dream !",1
"the tower offers elevators , but for those who like exercise you can also opt to do the climb and many do .",1
the tower is very beautiful and i was excited to be able to go to the top .,1
"at last , we made it to the world famour eiffel tower .",1
my recommendation is to go first thing in the morning or in the evening .,1
did not have tickets .,1
it feels amazing .,1
book your tickets in advance so you do n't have to queue .,1
in the process of planning and visiting i learned a few things worth sharing .,1
"go for sunset - make lifelong memories , take the pictures .",1
but once up there you enjoy a true magic view !,1
it is a great sight to see but you must book in advance or will wait hours !,1
the only problem here was the top was closed and no one around to explain why or what the issue was or what to do about it .,1
we were unable to get tickets online for the summit after trying for weeks .,1
the lines ups were about an hour for the elevator so we decided to take the stairs at the south or sud entrance .,1
"the fantastic views made up for the multiple queues , one to get through security , one to get tickets , one to get in the first lift and one to get in the lift to the summit , one to get in the lift for the decent and one for the final decent .",1
we appreciated the security measures and the army / police presence .,1
i have been to paris many times & never been up the tower .,1
completely wrong .,1
"we waited in line for about 30 minutes and were able to purchase tickets , yay !!",1
the eiffel tower is soo beautiful at night .,1
"though it seems redundant to write a review for the most established and recognized emblem in paris , if not all of western europe , i hope to offer some wisdom when seeing this breathtaking monument .",1
the guide thought nobody spoke french and made nasty comments about `` the stupid americans '' to his colleague .,1
i ca n't imagine the crowds during the day - go at night !,1
on our honeymoon went up this bad boy .,1
very congested but once inside its ok .,1
her beauty and magnificence are a testament to the creative spirit of humanity .,1
toilets are at the east tower pillar for free .,1
it is their policy for the event of emergency that you be able to evacuate dow the stairs .,1
definitely worth the spectacular view and the sheer beauty of the place .,1
"so , enough of the preamble .",1
"well worth a visit , especially the trip to the top .",1
"make sure you purchase a ticket to go all the way to the top , they sell them to just the 1st and 2nd floors too .",1
"we bought tickets in advance to skip the lines -lrb- a major bonus because other people who 've tried to visit the eiffel tower tell me they 've waited 3 hours in lines before - on a hot summer day , that 's completely unbearable -rrb- .",1
if you 're in paris you ca n't miss out on this one !,1
the lines are long to go up and it costs extra to go all the way to the top .,1
"we enjoyed a nice lunch up there at the lunch counter , reasonable prices for not having to pack anything with us .",1
"if i had the chance to do it again , i would ... .",1
we took the steps up to the sons floor my god what a workout tiring but you can stop and just admire the views .,1
bought in advance the skip q ticket so that saved lot of waiting and q timing .,1
its the place you must visit once in ur life .,1
it is a must see for every first time visitor though i thought it was a bit over-rated !,1
it is impossible visiting paris without going to this tower .,1
buy some memorabilia or merchandise to make the trip some thing worth remembering .,1
"we went in the evening at around 7 pm and stayed there till around 9:30 as the sun set was at 9 pm that day , we had ample time to marvel the scenes from different levels and directions .",1
avoid the hawkers and the `` guess which cup the ball is under '' guys .,1
we went at night and got to see it all lit up and sparkling .,1
"as the crowds and queues can be long , best buy tickets and visit the summit first , and then come to the 2nd .",1
just as you have imagine it .,1
then marvel at what you see .,1
we spent valentines day at the eiffel tower .,1
we went on thursday evening .,1
i took my grandson to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
be `` very '' careful .,1
the views across the city of paris are fantastic .,1
this is the place you have to conquer during stay in paris .,1
the lights are off at 1 a.m.,1
paris has a class of its own which no other city can match .,1
u can transform it in a romantic getaway on the top of paris .,1
"if you are time poor , like we were , then a great viewing spot is from the palais de chaillot , just a short metro ride away .",1
i would be very upset if i did n't get tickets to the top .,1
"approach on foot if you can -lrb- from the trocadero or along the seine from the east , for example -rrb- and watch the paris landmark get more and more enormous as you draw near .",1
"side note - if you 're hungry , the food vendors sell some amazing hotdogs -lrb- sounds crazy , i know ! -rrb-",1
there i took the c train .,1
we ended up getting champagne near the carousel and it was 5-10 euros more than on the eiffel tower .,1
just be mindful of the wind as that can put a dampener on what would be an otherwise truly amazing experience !,1
"if you do n't mind open heights the view from the tower , `` stunning '' .",1
we visited at a slow time and there were essentially no true crowds .,1
one of the marvels of the cuddos to them for maintaining and updating the structure without compromising the basics,1
"went there with my family which included 3 children - this is a must see - tickets are really hard to book if you purchase online - one thing we did was do the behind the scenes or backstage tour - check online for cultivar.fr - the trip was a bit long though , but it was fascinating to see the military bunker under eiffel tower and lots of other secrets and not-so-known historical facts about eiffel tower .",1
"the visitors of this monument locals and outsiders , all go crazy when they queue up for tour eiffiel .",1
"there are a whole lot of gypsies dressed in decent clothes around the tower , so i would warn people to be aware of who is around you .",1
just been worth the price of dying there too .,1
the lit up tower and the spirit of the people all around adds to the euphoria .,1
price is very seasonable - 7 $ for adults and 5 $ for kids .,1
it did n't spoil it though .,1
but i would n't get heart burn if you missed going up .,1
"standing on line to get in feels stupidly touristic , but once you start the climb you forget all those around you and the thrill of such a feat motivates your feet to climb .",1
there are toilets and restaurants -lrb- if you 're rich -rrb- and lots and lots to see !,1
classical landmark and a great restaurant at the top .,1
joined the queue at 9am on a sunday morning .,1
we went at sunset/early evening and it was beautiful !,1
"we went around 9pm , and waited in a quick que line .",1
although you might think that sounds crazy it 's not as bad as it may seem .,1
if you have time try it .,1
"this is a must when in paris , not to be missed -lrb- both during the day and at night ! -rrb-",1
probably the best point for photos are across the river in trocadéro,1
stands great .,1
such wonderful views !!,1
"sooner or later , most",1
"there are three tiers , accessible by stairs , but the third -lrb- highest -rrb- has to be taken via lift .",1
if you do n't visit this place while in paris you are not making the most of it,1
"it is worth stopping at each level , but start at the very top and work down , the second viewing level can get really crowded with people queuing for the lift to the top .",1
"it may cost more , but is worth it .",1
make sure you stop on the first floor ; the elevators route you up to the second floor but the first floor has interesting things for the kids to do .,1
it was amazing seeing the eiffel tower up close .,1
"i have been to the eiffel tower a few time , and it never fails to take your breath away .",1
"you will be drawn to the tower , and you really should visit at least once .",1
also paris is expensive and crowded but should be seen at least once in your life .,1
more like a huge electrcity transmission tower .,1
"alternatively if you are up for some adventure , walk the steps , save some $ and get an even better experience and feel better for the effort .",1
"when we visited , the queues were enormous -lrb- we tried at 3 different times but gave up -rrb- .",1
"we spent around two and half hours in the tower , but the couldnot watch the sunset on that day -lrb- however i returned here on our last day of paris tour to le jules verne and experienced the setting sun from here -rrb- .",1
we went during the day and it was a boring sight .,1
general point anyway is - it is impressive piece of architectural work .,1
a great landmark to see in person .,1
be prepared to go through two security lines to enter the elevators and then be prepared to be sausaged-in the elevators with no space to move !,1
so we opted for photos of the tower from the ground and it was a very nice trip for us .,1
you can save some time by purchasing tickets online in advance .,1
the north and east legs of the tower contain large 2 storey passenger lifts and the queues move at the same slow rate .,1
but when in paris ... you have to go .,1
first time to visit paris and eiffel tower is a must to see .,1
we went to the eiffel tower late thursday morning april 6 .,1
we walked down from the second floor and the children really enjoyed this .,1
"so , of course i had to come back to see it .",1
definitely recommend this to any that wants to dine at the eiffel .,1
at night look out for the 5 min sparkle of the eiffel tower :-rrb-,1
awesome site : -rrb-,1
unfortunately the fee is huge 17 euros per person : -lrb-,1
sad that the security procedures have to be in place now but do understand .,1
breathtaking views and photos !,1
we took the elevator to go down .,1
"around the eiffel tower , you will find a lot of touristy type things .",1
"once you are have entered after the initial security check , you can stare up into the structure 100 's of feet above .",1
"i said i understood we were the late ones , was there anything we could do .",1
"but make sure you book in advance online , it will save you a lot of time as the tower is so crowded with people even in the winter .",1
we also had quick access tickets up to the restaurant .,1
you have to go to the sommet and enjoy the view .,1
"the eiffel tower is impressive , it 's history , location , beaty and the most important the view , over the whole city of paris",1
"according to me , eiffel is best seen from montparnasse tower .",1
for the visit reserve 2 hours at least .,1
we waited for half an hour for this being sorted talking with several people until we could dump the scooter outside the security tent so they do n`t destroy it as being unattended .,1
do n't miss this if you are in paris .,1
"definitely pay to take the elevator , or you can walk up the stairs but it is pretty rough so if you 're not used to stairs i would opt for the elevator .",1
expected worse after hearing so many stories about pick pockets here .,1
just nothing wrong with visiting the eiffel tower .,1
we were not sure which day of our trip we 'd make it so did not purchase tickets in advance .,1
"i have been to the tower of eiffel many times , when visiting paris , and each time the magnificent view of the city from the top is fascinating .",1
i got a little bit of disappointment that we have to pay 7 euro entrance to climb the tower with stairs .,1
everyone has heard of the eiffel tower .,1
when you to the top it will be worth it .,1
book your tickets early to enjoy the sunset at the top of the tower .,1
wanted to do this for years .,1
deffo worth seeing at night the lights are just magical,1
terrific view of paris by night .,1
"but , the view is nice .",1
i had not seen the eiffel tower in the evening before .,1
the view from the tour was beautiful .,1
"we will be checking it out at night tomorrow , but so far , the day was worth it alone !",1
"i travelled there on the metro , coming off at bir-hakeim and walking to the tower .",1
however there is a secret i have been taught that i wish to pass on .,1
fun watched the elevator go up and saw the little man on the outside .,1
"beware of pick pocketers ... i.e. , anyone around you , especially teens and kids .",1
all in all it was a beautiful sight to see !,1
this is obviously a must-see .,1
going to the top was really awesome !,1
a relaxed way of seeing three attractions .,1
we finally got in the second level .,1
better to not contract any skip the line tour or `` behind the scenes eiffel tower '' which i had a bad `` customer satisfaction '' experience .,1
an iconic paris experience .,1
we got tickets to explore all open levels of the tower and it was worth it .,1
3 course meal with drinks .,1
it 's worth the wait to go there .,1
the tower offers beautiful views of paris .,1
i never expected it to be like it is .,1
i 'm glad we did both because it added to the overall experience .,1
"once you 're up on the eiffel tower , make sure to take the time to soak in the magnificent views .",1
must buy a separate ticket as the eiffel tower does not participate in the paris museum pass .,1
the eiffeltower is as amazing as always .,1
i recommend also that you go by when the lights get turned on around 9-10 pm .,1
you need to pay extra too .,1
its wonderful lot up .,1
another thing i was n't crazy about was the line at the 2nd floor to get tickets to take the elevator to the very top .,1
what an amazing building !,1
summit tickets were sold out so we got some for 40 euros from getyourguide - would recommend this if you find yourself in the same position because the top is a must .,1
this icon is a must st do when i 'm n paris .,1
we visited on a saturday morning during the easter long weekend .,1
paris seems to have become a large amusement park and has lost some of its charm .,1
i really do wish they can do something about it .,1
"following the terrorist attacks , crowds are very much down but the easy access was still appreciated .",1
we had a view from the top at night and it was spectacular .,1
"no surprise this is one of the most visited places in the world - everything that attracts , good and bad , can be found - queues , litter , hawkers , etc etc. .",1
i was told that it would be crowded but we came here around night so it 's peaceful and quiet .,1
lower cost of 7 euro per person compared to 17 euro for the elevator all the way to the top ... still got a great view .,1
as crazy as my experience was -lrb- i 'll get into that a little later -rrb- i highly recommend it .,1
"our hotel -lrb- le derby alma -rrb- was 5 minutes away from the eiffel , so every night after dinner , we would sit on the lawn and wait for the lights to come on .",1
"probably the most iconic structure in europe , worth going to paris just to see this .",1
"u could see the city like it 's unreal ... again not that many people , so we could take lots n lots of pics ... on the way back down we stopped by the 1st floor , the glass floor -lrb- u could walk on glass and see people below -rrb- ... this part i was kinda excited to see becoz it was a new part from eiffel , but the glass was in small pieces , so turned out not that interesting for me ... anyway , it is still a recommended thing to do when u r in paris ... i 've been to eiffel a few times , but this is my first time going up , coz other times were high seasons , so i did n't even bother with all the queueings ... so try to find the best time to go up !",1
what else can be added ?,1
the eiffel tower is a must see when in france .,1
the plus here is at the second level .,1
i was in paris recently when the unfortunate terrorists attacks took place in paris .,1
amazing views all around - went on a windy day with lots of people -lsb- as usual -rsb- but it was still very worth it !,1
especially beautiful at night in summer .,1
but even to stand beneath and look up is to create a memory .,1
long lines to take the elevator .,1
when i am in paris i always have to visit the eiffel tower .,1
"stunning and breathtaking views , but sadly one of he most famous and recognisable structures in the world is disappointingly ruined for me by the hordes of street traders aggressively selling absolute tat .",1
the iconic eiffel tower never disappoints in the day time or at night .,1
beautiful any time of the day or night .,1
night glow is breathtaking .,1
having printed tickets was easy .,1
i paid $ 15.50 and that took me to the sommet of tippy top by elevator .,1
definitely must visit at night and during the day !,1
"if it 's tourist food you want , it 's here as well , do n't expect fine dining though .",1
we celebrate my honey 's bday in paris it was a dream come true .,1
though jus being in the vicinity is also great .,1
on a gloriously sunny day the views from level 2 were amazing .,1
it 's part of the experience when visiting this tower .,1
get there early or pay for a guided tour to skip the lines .,1
the views are breathtaking but the queues are long .,1
also - check the evening times for the glitter lights - fantastic and take your camera for sundown shots .,1
"for me , a moderately fit 50 something it was an effort but i made it .",1
basically got to the tower around 10 am .,1
"you can not really miss it , when you go to paris you have to visit the eiffel tower , right ?",1
also its hard to find a decent restaurant to eat after if you find the food on the eiffel tower overpriced .,1
"again , these are tips for those with a fear of heights .",1
"i visited in april and although security lines were long , the wait to get into the tower was not too bad .",1
imperative you pre book for skip the line tickets or you 'll have a very long wait and also pre booked tickets were the only ones allowed right up to the top when we went .,1
if you want to avoid spending your holiday stuck in a queue in paris -lrb- and there will be many ! -rrb-,1
i first saw it 8 years back when i visited paris for the first time .,1
it 's a mush to see both views !,1
"if you do n't , be sure to get there very early .",1
not to miss .,1
"although the weather was n't the best , but totally worthy !",1
however the waits for getting on the elevators to the various levels were unbearable and quite unpleasant ... long waits and jostling people .,1
"that said , the food at the restaurant was excellent , the service terrific and oh the view .",1
having lunch there was pretty cool also .,1
"second time at the eiffel tower , first time we reserved our tickets online and it was super easy + fast .",1
cheap and once in a life time experience !,1
not so grand if you have any claustrophobia quirks .,1
"after 2 security checks , getting up was really interesting .",1
"in my previous visit in the past , i waited 2 1/2 hrs for a ticket .",1
"busy , so keep an eye on your kids .",1
we took a late trip to the eiffel tower on sunday evening -lrb- thankfully the metro runs very late so getting there and back from the 11th was n't an issue . -rrb-,1
no stairs at all .,1
"booked with a musement guided tour , we got here in an amazing mid-march sunny day .",1
what to say that has n't already been said !,1
arrive a few minutes earlier than the time on the tickets because you will pass through security .,1
"we first went to the eiffel tower on a saturday afternoon and the lines were crazy , so we had a quick snack near les vedettes de paris river boat deck .",1
stunning views !,1
never could get enough of it .,1
on the advice of friends who visited previously ... we opted not to wait hours in the long lines of tourists and not spend our day like that .,1
the view is amazing when you go up.the tower .,1
even from far you admire what human can do !,1
amazing views of the city and beyond and even had a glass of champagne at the top !,1
the security check takes some time .,1
have a glass of champagne at the top & enjoy the views ~ how blessed we are !,1
"but , the real fabulous view and experience is riding the elevator straight up .",1
we did not do any guided tours but made our way to the first floor of the tower and enjoyed a great -lrb- if somewhat smoggy -rrb- view of the city .,1
the light show is spectacular .,1
"even more beautiful in real life than i imagined , the eiffel tower was one of my favourite landmarks .",1
keep an eye out !,1
just leaves you in spellbounded daze .,1
buyer beware !,1
be prepared to be annoyed at the selfies and the selfie sticks .,1
"you do n't need to go to the very top , the second highest point is the same view with more space to walk around .",1
visited a few times now when going to paris .,1
this is the second time for me .,1
"lovely when we saw it during the night , unfortunately something happened in germany and in respect to them the put the german colours up ... really beautiful",1
there are 3 entrances in yellow .,1
anyone can go through security and get ddirectly under tour for free .,1
the waiting for lifts is a little long but great value for money and i would definitely reccomend a day and night vist at night it is a spectacular sight the lights flash ever hour from 9,1
"the views are great , but i personally preferred seeing the tower from down below when the lights came on - it was breathtakingly beautiful !",1
the steps look bigger and heavier when you 're at the ground .,1
must go place,1
my advice to anyone who has difficulty walking either for health reason or general unfitness -lrb- like me -rrb- take the lift to the 2nd floor then down again the stairs will kill you !,1
some great places to view the effiel tower is at the top of arc de triomphe and montparnasse tower !,1
you 'll be happy you did .,1
i hope i can come here again .,1
t.he verdict :,1
at the tower there is a lot to see from it 's top and even a lot more to learn .,1
does n't need any words to justify .,1
here we went visited the eiffel tower again .,1
we had not pre booked the tickets since the online booking was already booked for 3 months in advance .,1
amazing experience even if it was raining that night ... the tower sparkled .,1
the best time for your photos is anytime before 9.30 am in the morning or later at night when there are not too many people around .,1
"but do n't miss this fabulous tower because of it , just be careful of what going on around you",1
actually sunset happens quite late around 9:40 in summers,1
"at sunset , they turn on the lights -lrb- around 9 pm -rrb- and wait for the start of the hour .",1
beautifully iconic landmark in paris .,1
spectacular .,1
the view from the top is marvellous .,1
"old auguste knew what he was doing , especially when you consider he pulled this off in a little over two years .",1
i walked there from my hotel .,1
"a maravilhosa vista de paris , o sol se pondo às 9pm no verão .",1
"incredible views of the city anytime of day , although the lines could be long at times , for all levels .",1
we could n't go to the summit as it was 23:15 .,1
it looked so pretty and the views are amazing .,1
we visited the tour with a skip the line tour group and was easy and informational .,1
went up to the summit during twilight .,1
its an wonder .,1
"but once your up there there 's no rush , with cafe 's , restaurants and a champagne bar you could spend the day up there !",1
elegance .,1
"but , i was very disappointed !",1
i was in paris for 4 days and i came here everyday .,1
"the views from the eiffel tower are spectacular day or night , and even just being at -lrb- or under -rrb- such an iconic and famous landmark is a great experience !",1
"the queue is usually long yes , but just like every other touristic place , so its expected .",1
beware the pickpockets that are bussed in to steal your wallet .,1
towering personality of a true sort .,1
i never imagined how big it is .,1
"the eiffel tower is a spectacular sight , not to be missed .",1
it is very crowded and beware of pick pockets .,1
although we did n't go up to view the eiffel tower we were happy just walking through it .,1
took the metro to the trocadéro stop which was across the river from the eiffel tower .,1
one problem in the are there are gypsies that run in groups to scam and steal .,1
they gather in front and from behind .,1
"ate at the restaurant , staff was racist .",1
"to me , it was like a huge tower of grey metal .",1
you have to be there to be able to admire it fully .,1
our stuff were asked to place on the x-ray machine but it was just a quick check .,1
no introduction is necessary to this magnificent landmark .,1
"you should try going to the top , is very beautiful , totally worth it .",1
everything is easy and straight forward with clear signages .,1
the only problem was the sellers that were everywhere selling junk .,1
"they sell out within minutes of opening , but usually they will release another lot a week or 2 in advance of the actual day .",1
watch your bag at all time !!,1
saw a pickpocket running down the street with 2 knapsacks at that point so hold on to your stuff tight !,1
i am not going to describe it how it looks like as i do n't have the audacity to do that .,1
"i do n't know what to say , this is the mark of paris .",1
this is a must see for anyone who is visiting paris .,1
worth the wait but be prepared to queue if you have n't pre-booked .,1
we went up to the third level and were freezeing the wind was quite cold ... but we still managed to spend some time,1
no need to pay extra for `` express '' tickets since everyone will go thru the same airport type like security .,1
he told us lots of history about the tower and surrounding areas .,1
it feels completely magical .,1
"had champagne at the top , an absolutely amazing experience , paris itself is so beautiful aswell !",1
do n't miss the opportunity .,1
this is a must see when you visit paris .,1
a monument that may to be visible from outer space .,1
you have 3 choices .,1
but the queues in july are crazy .,1
super !,1
still wondrous to look at and appreciate .,1
this building is easily recognizable but only in life to understand how impressive it is .,1
and we enjoyed watching the special lights at 12.00 am .,1
its insanely busy .,1
"you ca n't go to paris and not go up the eiffel tower , so it 's a must do .",1
not much going on the 1st level other than the view and quite a lot of people jostling so joined a queue for the lift to the second level .,1
"if there is one thing i would recommend anyone visiting paris for the first time -lrb- or subsequent visits for that matter -rrb- , it 's visiting this iconic structure !!",1
"it 's always a sight to see , but you should definitely visit it at night !",1
you will never forget the scenery that 's up there .,1
queued for 50 mins to buy our tickets unfortunately when we got to the ticket booth they closed the top of the tower but this did n't matter it was still amazing !,1
this topped our satisfaction with having visited earlier in the day to take photos .,1
"we only went to the second level , as it was 96 degrees that day and line for the elevator to the top was extremely long .",1
"we got to the second floor and used the clean , queue free toilets & then bought an extra ticket to get the lift to the very top .",1
even people still in sleeping bags at 10am .,1
"we were set up with fat tire tours and our guide , antoine , was charismatic , fun and extremely knowledgeable .",1
antoine 's english was great !,1
"we spent hours queuing ... security , buying tickets , queuing for lift , second security , second lift , coming back down again .",1
"walk to the top if you dare the view is worth it , you can take an elevator though again be prepared to wait",1
the views of the eiffel tower i absolutely love love love but the views from the eiffel tower are b - and you can spend your time in paris in better ways .,1
we had lunch there so we got to skip waiting in line .,1
the food is actually pretty cheap and good .,1
"honestly , we were just as pleased with the view on the 2nd level as we were with the top level -lrb- not much changes and you have to stand in another long line again -rrb- .",1
definitely go to the summit .,1
was a fantastic experience and would recommend for anyone to do it !,1
be aware that there is a separate entrance for the jules vern restaurant in one of the `` legs `` of the tower .,1
allow at least half a day if you want to visit the top of the tower due to the queues .,1
it was long time pending to go with my lovely friends and ended up most memorable visit for both of us,1
we went here on the second last day of our visit to paris .,1
"to see it at night , especially when the strobes are lit , is a wonderful thing .",1
we met at fat tire tours nearby .,1
during winter there is no need for a skip the line ticket .,1
beutiful wonderful .,1
how can you not love this monument !,1
incredible architecture you need to see in close .,1
we went up to the top of the eiffel tower right around sunset and the views were wonderful .,1
we had to barter with them for a long time to get it down to what it was actually worth .,1
for example there are touts all over ruining your experience by selling you chinese imitation towers at $ 1 there are the cycle taxi guys irritating you too take a ride .,1
"you have to read the story of why it was built and who designed , built and managed it .",1
buy the three day unlimited pass to get you everywhere,1
sunset is the best time to go as it offers gorgeous views and there are less people .,1
great views of city but waited over an hour in line .,1
"i gave the tower 5 stars because that is what this iconic building deserves , built in two years as a temporary exhibition piece over a hundred years ago .",1
the view you get from the very top is just as good as the view from floor 1 or 2 i would n't suggest wasting the money to go up .,1
"well , it is a steel tower ... nothing spectacular in terms of look or beauty ... but the history for its construction and subsequent existence is quite interesting .",1
"it provided excellent value , attentive staff who really welcome you and appreciate your custom -lrb- good english as well -rrb- .",1
its a beauty in the night when additional lighting sparkles every hour .,1
"while the views and experience at the top and from close up are a 5 , the atmosphere around the base was at best a 1 .",1
i recommend to visit up to 3 rd level .,1
hence there will be a lot of people at level 2 and summit as no one will check time limit .,1
while i was satisfied to take pictures at ground level i am glad i paid to go to the summit .,1
i had been to the top on a previous trip but my wife had not and was n't too keen on a -rrb- waiting in line or b -rrb- heights !,1
"there are small stalls along the path selling drinks , souvenirs , food , etc. .",1
just do n't stop or speak to them .,1
then around 5 min to the next level and then we took the lift down .,1
you can hang out and picnic out for free .,1
amazing staff throughout who are very friendly .,1
"whatever you do , buy your tickets ahead of time !!!",1
"things have changed in paris , if you visit at night , be aware as there are marginal characters lurking near the now single entrances to the tower area .",1
did you know it sparked on the hour at night ?,1
this was my 8 year old 's favorite thing we did -lrb- other than the big playgrounds -rrb- .,1
in the day take the elevator up to the second floor or walk the many many steps .,1
we enjoyed our visit to the eiffel tower .,1
"but , it 's really spectacular in the evening .",1
"overall , prepare for crowds and enjoy the sites and views !",1
"no way out , now i am up the top and can not move one foot in front of me as there is so many , so many people in front of me - i ca n't see anything .",1
visited eiffel tower at sep 2015 .,1
we lined up around 7:30 pm to give us enough time to get up to the top before sunset .,1
i am very upset about the internet booking procedure for school groups to the eiffel tower .,1
"it 's nice to be able to say i have visited the eiffel tower , but going there was not as impressive as viewing it from a distance at night .",1
you can go at your own pace and stop as often as you like to enjoy the view along the way .,1
make sure you take the elevator all the way to the top .,1
not worth spending a lot of time and money to skip the line and go to the top of the tower !,1
walked around there and then decided to walk down the stairs to the bottom .,1
it never gets tiring .,1
"we had to just see this while in paris , and while it had the euro ball suspended from it .",1
superb structure ... its beauty is on its excellence on sunny days with clear blue sky .,1
i 've seen the eiffel tower before but the last time i had was only from a boat trip and from the park at the base .,1
lots of disappointed tourists .,1
i highly recommend making reservations ahead of time on-line .,1
loved everything aboutthis paris icon .,1
"we could have gotten tickets to go up to the 1st or 2nd floor , which looks interesting , by waiting in line , but we did n't .",1
the landmark speaks for itself really but the only advise i can give you is to go to the top .,1
"if visiting paris , you have to go to the must-visit attraction of the city .",1
"sure the crowds will be overwhelming and annoying , but it 's worth the hassle to reach the top and take in what paris has to offer .",1
massive structure !,1
"however , the area around the tower was crowded with lots of people selling tourist trinkets and it was very dirty .",1
"not once , but at least three .",1
"first time for our 24-year old son and second time for my wife and i , the first being on our honeymoon 24 years ago .",1
"filled with tourists and so many people , one feels suffocated .",1
its has great architecture and is magnificent as well .,1
it had been raining the day before and we had n't had an opportunity to climb the eiffel tower like we wanted .,1
went up just before it got dark and even we were on level 2 darkness fell and it was spectacular .,1
the garden just across the tower gives magnificent views and of course best place to click photos .,1
it 's the eiffel tower ... it 's iconic .,1
no line to go up to the top .,1
"next stop , glass floor level , very special and great views .",1
i chilled amongst the green grass several times in my visit so i had a beautiful view of eiffel tower whilst having a picnic and beer .,1
no waiting when you book your eiffel tower tour in advance .,1
"the romance of just being there , the structure and seeing the building from so far away from an open top bus was amazing .",1
we spent about 2 hours there altogether and it was great - one of the must see highlights of our visit .,1
"in this case however , it was perfect .",1
"what can i say , it 's the eiffel tower , and captures the quintessential paris with a view !",1
eiffel tower has 3 levels with differential ticket pricing .,1
had an amazing time and it felt great to be on top of eiffel tower and the view of the city was breathtaking !,1
avoid the line .,1
"plus , a combo stairs/elevator ticket to the top is only 13 euros as opposed to 17 euros .",1
my kids and i went here and it was truly a once in a life time experience .,1
it gives you just an amazing view of paris and you realize how big it actually is .,1
then again i think since it 's off peak hours it should n't be a huge concern .,1
"it may be a touristy cliché thing to do , but you simply must go !",1
it was dark when we were at the top which may help people with fear of heights such as myself .,1
"by day , this structure is plain , but once the sun sets , you feel wowed .",1
"you can pay to go higher but i personally do n't think its worth it , you wont see anything more , just everything smaller !!",1
i love the way the lighting changes on the hour,1
"as a student in paris , i went there so many times .",1
the champagne on the summit was a moment to cherish !,1
it was a life time experience .,1
"perhaps it is better to prebook tickets beforehand though , rather than joining the large queues at the base of the tower .",1
"anyone going to paris must go to the eiffel tower , both for the seeing the tower itself , as well as the views from the top .",1
"the administration knows how to move people and we really enjoyed our time there , the view undescribable , amazing !!",1
"a great view especially from the top where the elevator goes , it has a great restaurant at the top and the view is 360 degrees !!!",1
eiffel tower is simply superb and you have breathtaking views .,1
it was well worth it .,1
the eiffel tower is a must see if you visit paris .,1
first no matter what they tell you you get soaked .,1
you can walk up half way then you have to get the lift to the tops .,1
loved to finally see the eiffel tower !,1
"even more magnificent than its photo , make sure you take the lift right to the top for breathtaking views right over paris .",1
"my first visit was on a saturday afternoon in august and it was extremely busy right underneath the tower , but if you walk towards the grassy area you will find enough space to sit , enjoy your picnic lunch or dinner , and admire the scenery .",1
"yes , the eiffel tower is one of the most-recognized structures in the world , and it can sometimes seem that everybody in the world has come by -lrb- more than 200 million to date -rrb- .",1
we went at a great time and only had to queue for a very short time so i would recommend going at night time on a sunday night .,1
the food and service was amazing !,1
"you will understand why so many people from around the globe fall in love with this city when you see it all around you , from above .",1
i want to go back in summer too .,1
we ate .,1
carry own alcohol or drinks .,1
tourist-craziness abounds here every day we passed .,1
"must be seen by every human being , best to be seen with a guide who shows you more then an average tourist can be able to see from underground to the top with a lot of interesting comments",1
go early to avoid the crowds .,1
once you are back down i would reccomend a nice picnic in the champ de mars park -lrb- big green thing behind tower -rrb- really enjoyed sitting there and relaxing,1
"food was deliciously french with lots of flavours , textures and sauces .",1
"also , for some reason the administration would rather have long lines of people instead of opening one more line !!",1
try to time you visit an hour or so before sunset .,1
we were only able to visit the top at 10:30 at night since we purchased our ticket too late .,1
firstly our travel to paris was january 2015 but tripadvisor will not let me go back that far .,1
"admittedly , at the time we went it was looking like it was about to rain and it was very grey out .",1
but by all means ... do it .,1
getting to the eiffel tower was fun .,1
sparkles eagerly 30 minutes in the summer .,1
they need to get creative with the shops .,1
always thought this place was a bit overrated but that opinion changed when we visited and also how pretty it looks at night .,1
the area surrounding the tower is traffic congested and looks very tired .,1
the timeslots were all sold out when we were there so people had to hoof it to the second floor ... after standing in line for 1 + hours .,1
if you go late in evening ... after 9pm ... the queues are not long and you can go to the summit and back down within an hour or two !,1
but the 360 view of the city at the top makes up for it all ... even the cold gale force winds we felt on the outside viewing area could n't dampen our enthusiasm ... soooo memorable ...,1
shame we did not have time to go up it but the queues are very long .,1
the african guys selling souvenirs were pretty nice .,1
only downside is lots of queueing but well worth it .,1
elevators are very small and you have to walk most of the time .,1
we got to the ticket office and that is where we had a bad experience .,1
"i was scared out of my wits , but let me tell you ... the view ... oh the view was just breathtaking !",1
but the ready to the long line to go inside .,1
stunning views from the very top but make sure you take a jacket as it 's chilly !,1
we decided to go about an hour before sunset .,1
we planned to visit on the saturday but the queue long as expected .,1
also another good thing is to see it from the place trocadero and also to go up to the elevator .,1
we did n't manage to go to the top as the queue is more than it 's definition .,1
"the grounds and gardens around are unkempt , lots of litter .",1
"a lot more security checks than last time but that is a sad reflection on the whole city now , we did this with a tour group and did n't have to wait long .",1
seeing the eiffel tower at night was amazing !,1
"visiting the top floor was the best , great photo ops , taking the stairs down from the 2nd platform was ok .",1
the tour was informative and well paced .,1
"it 's a beautiful city , but the wait times to go up the eiffel can be up over 2 hours .",1
"high security now in place , do n't bring much with you .",1
my husband and i have been to paris several times .,1
the queues are also very long .,1
was good to skip the line to go up eiffel tower but still have to wait for the whole group to go through security and get their tickets before joining line to go up .,1
the structure of the tower was just beautiful at night .,1
views stunning .,1
"seeing it at night its even more spectacular , you dont see the crowds of people milling around the base to get on the endless ques to go up to the top , and if you wait for the night show on the half hour the lights twinkle and sparkle so its extra special .",1
we visited the tower in the early afternoon .,1
"the staff were very attentive and professional , but of the greatest note were views , which were to die for .",1
"our guide , stephanie was very knowledgeable and extremely entertaining and along with providing the ease of access , told us all sorts of interesting things about the tower , it 's construction and the area around us .",1
the elevator ride is crowded but do-able .,1
"well worth going to , disappointed its not easier to get up .",1
go to the back corner of the tour and join the shorter queue for 1/3 of the price and spend time climbing it .,1
"i certainly would not drive if i was visiting france - reminders of piccadilly circus , london ?",1
cafe and toilets on the first level too are handy with kids .,1
get your tickets in advance so that you can skip the big line-ups .,1
in fact we spent around 5 hours in total just enjoying the eiffel tower and the fact it was new years eve .,1
lots of history to read along the way .,1
"best view is at night , on the hour when it has its light show .",1
walked down the stairs rather than waiting for the lift .,1
"do n't miss the first floor with a glass floor , gift shop , washrooms and refreshments .",1
definitely find a fat tire tour operator to take you to skip the lines .,1
"out of the 6 of us , 4 went to the top and 2 stopped at the lower level .",1
i think you could omit going to the summit if you do n't want to wait in line for that elevator .,1
and the view is off cause very beautiful,1
"looks lovely from a far , but when you get near , it is just a iron construction that sticks out of the lovely , typical parisian streets and buildings in that part of the city .",1
"the iconic scene of paris , mixed with street peddlers and long lines to go to the top .",1
i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this attraction .,1
the best is to go up by stairs .,1
"if you are going up to the top , there is a special express elevator - non-stop !!",1
it was bank holiday friday so can only assume it would n't be so busy on a normal week day .,1
"it 's an inexpensive adventure though , and well worth it .",1
"if you are enthusiastic , you can climb to the summit .",1
i loved it !,1
views from on top are monumental !,1
"booked on line , printed off voucher which gave exact details of meeting point for agent .",1
i purchased a ticket to go to the top of the tower .,1
it was beautiful to see and we were glad to cross it off our bucket list but try an off-peak time to minimize the crowd .,1
she 's beautiful in all weather .,1
the tower was beautiful day and night .,1
"amazing views of the eiffel tower from multiple locations , including the boat tours on the seine .",1
the sign at the bottom was saying `` reduced visibility '' for the top but we still had a fantastic view !,1
you get to go into the world war i bunker and into the base of one of the pillars to see the lift mechanisms .,1
"had we not booked the tickets in advance , we would not have been able to see this piece .",1
the first partial view of tower i already got from one of the louvre windows .,1
had a great time visiting the eiffel tower .,1
soak in the sun .,1
"the higher up you get , the more pointless it gets , the top floor is not that impressive tbh .",1
the city itself defines the meaning of art de vivre .,1
"it 's definitely the sight to see , again ... even if it 's just from the distance , the pictures will never do a place like this justice .",1
definitely a must do !,1
the views were breathtaking and we enjoyed all levels .,1
we had scheduled this stop for a night visit and did not want to rearrange our plans .,1
all of paris to see .,1
you appreciate more in the evening when the lights on !,1
take a trip up the tower to see great views of the city .,1
it was over 20 years since i was at the eiffel tower and as a young boy i did n't remember much of the visit but it certainly opened my eyes to paris again .,1
you have to go to this when in paris .,1
we were able to see and enjoy new sites from every angle from the top deck which gave us a new perspective and appreciation .,1
"the views of the city are wonderful , and it truly is an iconic experience for visiting this city .",1
the eiffel tower is a must see during your trip to paris !,1
seeing the most visited eiffel tower was a dream come true .,1
we did n't bother with skip the line tickets or pre-booking and it worked out really well as we were up there as the tower stared twinkling .,1
some very good advice : do not wait too late in the day to go .,1
extremely expensive fix priced 5 or 6 course meal ~ but if you can afford it ~ a once in a lifetime treat !,1
"we had opportunity to enjoy lunch at the first bridging level of the tower eiffel overlooking the river seine and all around paris as seen from walking around inside the restaurant at that level and wow , it was really something to do .",1
"plan ahead of you want a ticket for this or plan to wait in line for a while to go , up .",1
i have known about the eiffel for decades and this was my first time seeing it .,1
excellent tour .,1
"beware of the street vendors , they tend to get in your face a bit .",1
we booked a walking tour with tickets to the eiffel tower .,1
an iconic structure with impressive history and architecture .,1
views are amazing when you reach the top and you cab spend as long as you want up there .,1
my wife just ca n't contain her joy seeing the eiffel tower .,1
i visited the eiffel tower with tourists from nearly every country in the world judging from the accents and clothing !,1
that was until i walked under it .,1
the best is when returning from a trip away ... you know you 're home when you see the eiffel tower .,1
if you go at night you will have a great view of the eiffel tower while it is light up .,1
i can see the whole paris .,1
do you need my opinion to visit eiffel tower ?,1
"the lines can be horrible , and i did not feel that it was so special to be up there .",1
i went all the way up and loved it .,1
there are just too many dodgy people around .,1
walked from my apartment .,1
try to plan it ahead and book tickets before !,1
those in my family who were seeing the eiffel tower for the first time were prepared for disappointment .,1
we took the tour that gets you up the lift to the second level - but not the top .,1
that ride up gave my anxiety a major boost .,1
"it is a great place to have a great view over the city , but note that the ques can be very long and that it can be cold up there .",1
security was tight when we went .,1
"i walked along the river , went up to the trocadero and spent time at the park .",1
there are several reasonably priced grocery stores 2 blocks e of the se most corner of the park .,1
i could n't actually believe the size of the thing !,1
the eiffel tower is a beautiful structure and when you go inside the views of the city are breathtaking .,1
"but go see again at night , the lights show is very beautiful !",1
this is another attraction i would pre-purchase my tickets for .,1
also not to be missed .,1
"the queues move fast , i never stood in one place for two long .",1
you always hear about eiffel tower and how romantic it is blah blah .,1
we did n't go up this trip but watched it sparkle each night .,1
"it 's fairly expensive personally but it is well worth it - make sure you go to the top , not just level 2 - you 'll regret it otherwise .",1
"you have to stop for a breather , but then so do others climbing alongside you as well .",1
appreciate it and take few photos .,1
we used viator to book a tour and found the whole experience enjoyable especially the tour guide `` ferret '' who was a local parisian with a wealth of knowledge .,1
we then avoided most of the queues as we were early and caught the lift to the summit .,1
"normally , when the park is open -lrb- surrounding the tower -rrb- people love to sit and relax as there are lots of seats available and if dry the grass is nice too .",1
the free market at its worst given the throng of vendors .,1
"we enjoyed walking around the tower , the upper level gave great views of the city .",1
"if you 're feeling brave , there are glass floors to walk on , at the first floor level -lrb- still a long way above ground level ! -rrb-",1
not a nice experience .,1
it is a spectacle to behold .,1
"customer service was of a high standard , we had a 3course set menu , the food was extremely good could not fault it at all , very friendly atmosphere , however very noisy .",1
vey impressed was much more than expected .,1
"everything people say about this structure is true - it is an amazing feat of architecture , provides great views of the city of paris and overall is a place that needs to be visited .",1
"no need to repeat just how awesome this thing is but , if you want a good experience without too much trouble , take the following advice :",1
because of the security it takes a while to get near the tower but at least your safe .,1
"the view is exactly what you expect , and totally worth it !",1
enjoyed seeing the tower and can now knock it off my bucket list .,1
the lines for those trying to buy tickets was huge .,1
"slightly overcast when we reached the top , but clear enough we got great views of the city .",1
today we went to the eiffel tower as one part of our 40th wedding anniversary gift to visit paris .,1
i 'm glad i have my twinkling videos to remind me of how much i love paris .,1
there was about 600 steps to the first level where you can buy refreshments and walk on the glass floor .,1
this has to be one of the must do 's in paris .,1
"would have loved to go to the top , but the line was way too long .",1
being under the tower was ahead experience as well.we went to the second floor level at night and then from there were able to get tickets to the top from there .,1
"now , i 'm scared of heights so i had my worries going up the eiffel tower , especially at night , but the staff there really helped me to get over it",1
we went up the tower till the 2nd floor & paris by night is splendid .,1
"when booking a hotel try to go someplace close to the eiffel tower so you can get a view of it , and see the lights on it light up every hour !",1
we arrived around 6pm with no reservations and there were just 2 families ahead of us in the ticket counter .,1
the queues .,1
it is a shame the gun-toting soldiers on anti-terrorism duties can not be used to drive away the souvenir-selling scammers who are everywhere !,1
had purchased upfront online priority access tickets with a time slot ... arrived early .,1
"the view is nice as expected , i preferred viewing it from a distance then looking out from it .",1
we strolled over around 10:00 p.m. on a weeknight and decided the line looked pretty light for tickets to the top .,1
"she always wanted to visit this particular landmark , so i booked a hop on , hop off bus tour .",1
"terror threats and such made access to the site difficult , but still worthwhile .",1
"i instantly fell more in love with the eiffel tower when i approached it , especially at night .",1
eiffel tower is a must see but be extremely careful with your bags .,1
"although for sure , it is an absolute must to go to the top !!",1
"also they say no wine , bring it , no one will say anything to you .",1
had the guide done her job to make sure we could get to the top it would have been nice .,1
"on another day , we did a behind the scenes tour and had lunch at the restaurant in the 2nd floor .",1
"we made it to the very top and had champagne up there , it was memorable !",1
the tour on river siene was beautiful too .,1
i loved my visit to the eiffel tower with my mum .,1
"the tower had to done as my daughter had never actually been to the top and was wishing she had , so we all paid our 17 euros and got in the two shaky lifts .",1
it never got old .,1
this was much bigger and better than i thought it would be .,1
go all the way to the top .,1
i just wish to had the chance to look down from it in a sunny day - maybe some day .,1
"we booked a tour to the summit of the eiffel tower and while we enjoyed the tour -lrb- and skipping lines -rrb- , it 's so crowded that we found the view of the tower more inspiring than the view from the tower .",1
"like most places , it has many moods , depending upon the time of year and day you visit it .",1
"the eiffel tower is well worth visiting for the incredible views - however , as it is one of the top -lrb- if not the main -rrb- tourist attractions in paris , prepare yourself for crowds - not only in the queues for tickets and security , but also waiting for the lift to go up -lrb- and down -rrb- and whilst you are in the various viewing areas .",1
get a ticket to go to the top !,1
the third level -lrb- very top -rrb- was closed owing to heavy wind when we were there .,1
you will have a fabulous meal ... really !,1
btw the beloved parisian staple longchamp makes a bag with the eiffel tower on it which is lovely !,1
i felt a bit insecure to climb on it .,1
"also make an effort to visit it at night , simply breathtaking",1
beautiful at nights .,1
was well worth it .,1
the park around the eiffel tower is lovely and there are lots of great angles to get pics .,1
once you reached the second level .,1
beautiful views of paris !!!,1
"we felt rushed , i 've never experienced this before ; starter was brought with dessert at the same time and dessert sat on the edge of the table .",1
go - you will not be disappointed .,1
go to the top fir sure .,1
"but if you dig deeper , there are unbelievable amounts of hidden surprises to uncover .",1
what says paris more than the eiffel tower .,1
then waited another 30 minutes on the second floor .,1
"there are three levels you can go to , the tip top -lrb- only accessible by elevator -rrb- and the first two levels -lrb- accesible by stairs -rrb- .",1
we walked down from 2nd to 1st which was also a first for me .,1
we visited late in the afternoon and got the chance to see it light up .,1
"the tower is great such an iconic landmark , i highly suggest seeing it during the day and at night as the experience is very different and worthy !",1
but the sight was really beautiful from the top .,1
there are cafes on the levels and gift shops.to think this was only supposed to be a temporary constructions amazing,1
the line was far too long to bother with a trip to the top so i opted to grab a bottle of wine and some cheese and baguette to sit on the lawn .,1
the eiffel tower is immense up close .,1
what a view !!!,1
-lrb- crepes ! -rrb-,1
we bought our timed tickets on their official site -lrb- 17 $ -rrb- and went to the summit !,1
you can use the lift to get to the restaurants in the tower or to the champagne bar .,1
we walked for an hour from our apartment near notre dame to the eiffel tower .,1
do n't forget to go to the 1st level .,1
if that 's ok it 's a bit cheaper but why bother ?,1
the view is just incredible !,1
"we went on a cloudy rainy day , with friends and had a great experience .",1
it is worth the price to go to the top .,1
do not miss it and enjoy all paris,1
"it 's so big , and you can see the cogs and wheels -lrb- original -rrb- working for the elevators .",1
highly recommend you walk down from the lower section .,1
you will then have to queue for the final -lrb- and worth while -rrb- trip to the top .,1
"that being said , one still has to wait in a bit of some lines but all in all far less than if you do n't have tickets for a specific time slot .",1
very nice experience .,1
especially to climb to the top or take the lift .,1
it was an overcast morning so it was quite chilly on top so i would definitely bring a light jacket .,1
"could not believe the size of the eiffel tower , it 's massive !",1
"i watched the structure , in the morning , at dusk , in the night .",1
"we booked our tickets in advance for a specific time on the eiffel tower website , this meant that we went into a specific entrance and avoided the 2 or 3 hour queue !",1
we were lucky that the rain stopped for our visit and part of the sky cleared .,1
it was a lot of fun but super crowded .,1
it 's worth going up all the way to the top as the views are breathtaking .,1
it is indeed a masterpiece but looks even more beautiful when lit up at night .,1
"they are pushing you to buy their stuff , very annoying .",1
"you do have to negotiate all the street sellers , but well worth it !",1
"this was a better option , as we did not have to queue and got a good deal of exercise .",1
no need to go up to be impressed with its magic .,1
"as for views of the tower itself , stroll across the river to the trocadero for the best photo op .",1
suggest take it in turns to queue and the others go off and take photos from a distance .,1
initially i was `` i do n't need to do this '' however i quickly changed my mind when i was climbing up the tower .,1
"if you are visiting during nighttime , do wear warm clothes as it can be quite windy and chilly up there .",1
we took the elevator to the second floor with no wait when we purchased this excursion as a part of a tour : worth it .,1
there are also signs everywhere about pick pockets so do have your wits about you .,1
"superb views , although go early if possible the queue was long even in march and very crowded at the top .",1
another 15 minutes .,1
"my advise is do n't stop and talk , keep moving and give a grimace look upon your face .",1
"suggest to walk around the lanes facing eiffel tower for pictures , less tourists .",1
soooo amazing .,1
"a very nice , safe and secure place to be .",1
all of the waiting is totally worth it for the spectacular views !,1
"i 'm not interested in a view from high building , do i thought the view from the second floor will be enough for me .",1
good value .,1
"we in awe at the beauty and size of the eiffel tower , sadly we decided not to go up as the queues were quite long so i suggest you go early in the day before they start to build up , but i am sure the views would be well worth the wait .",1
not too expensive either .,1
"while buying the tickets , make sure which type of ticket you are buying , some take you to the top and some only till level 1-2 , also check the access to lifts and stairs .",1
"the tower , and the view from its heights , are picturesque .",1
never knew there was a skating rink in january on level on the first platform .,1
trip was back in 2015 .,1
"the direct ticket to top costs $ 17 , and for only 2nd level $ 14 .",1
panoramic views of the city of lights is a memory for a lifetime -lrb- and awesome photo ops too -rrb- .,1
i had been there with my wife and my children .,1
they have elevator for easy accessibility and a pretty deck below for picture taking and leisurely walking .,1
be prepared to stand in a queue for quite a while but it 's worth it .,1
"i had this romantic symbol on my to-visit list , but could never guess how joyous an experience .",1
the city of paris was beautiful from this vantage point .,1
i would live to go back again & again,1
i had been to paris in the 1980 's and then went again in 2014 & 2016 .,1
if you feel adventurous then a climb or ride to the top of the tower is next .,1
after a long waiting in que we reached upon upper storey .,1
it 's a beautiful structure .,1
you see pictures and videos but until you 're in front of it you ca n't admire the greatness of the tower .,1
"the grandeur , hugeness ... the roads flow seamlessly between its pillars , and it majestically rises to the top .",1
what a shame !!!,1
the view was amazing !!!,1
we waited a very long time in queue but we both agreed it was well worth it .,1
"service was very good , and meals excellent but not big servings .",1
highly recommend this as a way to make this and extraordinary experience !,1
"love going to et but so sad to see all the fencing , security metal detectors etc. .",1
"she is magnificent and the views from all levels is amazing , plus all the old lift systems and pullys still functioning ... but we planned our day on visiting the eiffel tower on our last stop before heading home .",1
the view from here is breathtaking .,1
"it is best to go up the tower on a clear day , but i am happy just hanging out in viewing distance .",1
in love with the eiffel tower,1
paris and all its views is really so historical and amazing .,1
if you do n't like confined spaces then think again .,1
"however , spare yourself some time -lrb- and money -rrb- , and do n't pay to climb it .",1
do the tower at dusk and watch the city light up before your eyes .,1
we crossed the bridge into the maddening crowds and walked outside the base around to the park area leading up to the tower .,1
it may be crazy but as the guided tour said .,1
we were told to go out of the premises and around the corner to find a restroom .,1
"we had reservations for an early evening tour , and were glad we went at that time .",1
even our teenagers loved it .,1
with its grandeur architecture and lovely parks next to the seine river makes the eiffel tower an iconic place .,1
atmosphere was fantastic !,1
"the museum pass does not cover you for this , so you would need to stand in the queue .",1
i had made the tour of the eiffel tower and it was great .,1
", but the lines were too long , and i 'm afraid of heights anyway ... not my favorite parisian site , but of course it 's a must see , so go !",1
which it completely is .,1
it 's really nice to just lay on the grass with only the tower in view in the night sky .,1
it 's huge !!,1
we have come to visit the eiffel tower for the 3 rd time s we really enjoy the beautiful sights and atmosphere up on the observation decks .,1
"since it was summer time , the sky was clear and it was a great experience .",1
also if you want to see the top it is best to buy the ticket on ground before you get into the lift .,1
definitely choose the skip the line option as the queue are ridiculously long !,1
this was our second trip to the eiffe tower with family .,1
"everybody going to france has to see this monument , the symbol of france .",1
overall a must visit .,1
"the small cafe is awful , overpriced and dreadful food .",1
we got skip the line tickets for eiffel tower which was good idea as we saw people standing in long queues and we directly went ahead through special entry .,1
its not a memorial unlike many other structures built around the world and made to commemorate 100 years of french revolution .,1
"go early as the cue can get very very long -lrb- few hours long -rrb- , we only waited 1 hour .",1
but when i saw it from close i was awestruck .,1
it was way more beautiful that what is portrayed in the popular culture .,1
taking pictures by night is a must do when around the tower grounds .,1
word of caution we had walked over with our two small children and thus had a stroller .,1
you ca n't skip the eiffel tower on your first trip to paris .,1
how can one visit paris and not see the eiffel tower ?,1
also queues for the toilets .,1
of course there are people from many places there .,1
would not have bothered to go the the top ... better pictures were from the 2nd landing than at the top,1
the view of paris will be spectacular .,1
would recommend .,1
anyway we arrived at the but to take us to the palace of versailles in time .,1
went at night time was magnificent to see paris glowing !,1
ascent to the top is a must !,1
"great fun , and the best way to get oriented for the rest of your stay .",1
visited the eiffel tower but personally i feel it looks a lot more beautiful at night than the day !,1
nice area to move around .,1
at night when it 's all lit up it looks amazing .,1
trying to hang out in the cold and rain proved difficult .,1
we decided to walk up the steps .,1
we paid in advance as the queues are long and you need to make sure your ticket is the right one if you want to go right to the top as most are only to second floor still a good view of paris though .,1
it does n't matter if you pay to go to the top or not you will still get an amazing view !,1
after seeing the tower in all the movies you would think it was much bigger than it is .,1
i visited the eiffel tower at night .,1
amazing view of the illuminated eiffel .,1
view of river seine from the second floor of the eiffel tower was awesome !,1
we did the walk to the 2nd floor as the top was closed which was disappointing but the view and the tower itself was amazing,1
the view was incredible but the top was very windy on one side .,1
"walk around the tower , watch your stuff and check out beautiful views of the city from the top .",1
"make sure you buy 3rd floor tickets , though that floor is subject to weather conditions .",1
"it was a quiet day in early november , but surely warranted two lifts working .",1
it just a marvellous man made creation .,1
trocadero cafe great place to see the lights twinkling or early morning petit dejeuner -lrb- breakfast -rrb-,1
"only 60m high , but lots to do and learn , do n't forget to walk onto the sky bridge .",1
"i have wanted to see the eiffel tower for years , and in august i got to go .",1
the eiffel tower was awesome building .,1
even though we 'd checked the weather forecast it was cloudy at 11.30 am so had to go .,1
would do this again in a heartbeat .,1
now there are long queues at each pier and it is not cheap .,1
most of it is fun to watch .,1
you can not just grow tired of taking photos at different angles .,1
please don ´ t tell me that you go to paris without seeing eiffel tower .,1
the que for elevators to take you to the top is huge so adjust your timings accordingly .,1
this large metal structure is best viewed from a river cruise away from the massed crowds and selfie stick nutters .,1
visited the eiffel tower both at night and also during the day to see its full beauty .,1
glass floor kinda cool but too small .,1
it has three floors and all are accessible to the public -lrb- obviously you have to pay for it -rrb- .,1
"definitely , a must see but be prepared for long lines .",1
"on the taxi ride to the hotel , i could see the top of the eiffel from miles away .",1
each time just looking at it from different places or angles or at different time of day or night it just looks so elegant and magnificent .,1
i was there when there was night and i can enjoy an incredible view .,1
the park around it is great with lots of people sitting in the grass and enjoying the sun .,1
make sure you see it on the hour for its sparkly show .,1
"go take a look at day and night , it 's incredible .",1
and then at the top enjoy amazing views of this beautiful city !!,1
great restaurant just below on the river too .,1
other than that was a very good day out,1
it was a really nice day and great to see it but next time we want to take the views from the top,1
to stand there thinking about how it was made so many years and is still structurally sound today !,1
i missed to see eiffel town in light .,1
after studying it and admiring it in every kind of picture and movie i sadly have to say that i was not really impressed by the tower .,1
great morning !,1
"for those who want to buy souvenirs , buy them from the africans carrying the keychains but make sure to have a local haggle for the price before buying .",1
there was no allocation left so i ended up booking a guided tour with one of the tour companies .,1
there is no skipping that line .,1
"however , a warning .",1
peddlers are everywhere .,1
nice one is icd skating park with free use,1
in the second floor we wait too much time .,1
"not many members of staff to be found roaming around , and the ones that are are hardly identifiable as there does n't appear to be a standard uniform .",1
a place i must visit at least once each trip .,1
"once all the way up , the views are incredible .",1
unbelievable experience !!,1
a once in a lifetime visit .,1
"sure it 's touristy , but you 're in paris so you have to visit !",1
when you get to the top you are able to get some great photos .,1
the lighting and architecture took my breath away .,1
there is usually a quite a crowd but if you can be patient and stay in line for about 20 minutes that should be fine .,1
my advise is to do the tour ... and go all the way to the top ... and then go back down and have your meals on the ground .,1
"we had a simple dinner with wine , cheese , sausages and bread .",1
"the eiffel tower is such a majestic building , bearing in mind all the building in paris are low except in the business district .",1
the eiffel tower was gorgeous .,1
"however , if you are prepared and organised it is not too bad .",1
the tower is a wonderful structure to take photos of and ride up to the top .,1
great food and drinks .,1
"go to the top , do n't think of saving some euros by only going to second story.the view from top is amazing !!!",1
fabulous sight seeing .,1
see it at night for a fantastic experience .,1
so hollywood but nice .,1
"a stunning view of paris , with the tower lighting up in a dazzling sparkle-lightshow every hour .",1
must be seen on a roof top bus tour to appreciate its majestic !,1
"i recommend going to the very top , though it does get cold and windy up there !",1
what can i add about the beauty and experience of the eiffel tower that has n't been said already ?,1
also make a strong effort to try to make it back in night to see the eiffel tower lights .,1
we arrived mid afternoon on a thursday in early august and ended up with little to no line as we 're willing to hoof it .,1
it is spectacular !!,1
we went up here both during the day and at night and i would recommend visiting .,1
in my opinion you get a better view of paris -lrb- with tower included ! -rrb-,1
the site is historical but a visit is not without the high security challenges .,1
"if you go to paris you need go to see this meraville , on the top you can see all and is amazing ...",1
there are many skip the line tours .,1
"we could n't get in for a tour , so book well in advance if you are going .",1
"unfortunately , time passed & more people came so it was difficult to get pictures without stranger heads in the pics .",1
wish i had gone earlier so we could have spent a bit more time-but frankly did n't expect short line .,1
"the views from the top are nice , but not worth the hassle of getting there .",1
"it was a gorgeous day , the visitors were all excited and the staff is very professional .",1
the view and experience were great and it is something we will remember forever .,1
it was booked solid for a week and we could not go up .,1
great history and the structure is more massive than i imagined .,1
the glass floor is cool and erie .,1
queues are long but move relatively quickly so do not let them put you off .,1
"a trip to the top costs some euros and a wait in line , so do n't come here with no time or daylight to spare .",1
i had to use the restroom .,1
the tour guide warned us of the pickpockets everywhere - on which paris authorities have n't really cracked down .,1
"the views from north , south , west and east were amazing .",1
the guide was good and pointed out all the sights of paris .,1
"my fears that france would be victim to a terrorist attack on 14 juillet were sadly justified in nice , but not in paris .",1
absolute delight to see .,1
it 's a great experience .,1
very fun .,1
beautiful tower !!,1
buy you ticket on line to set a time and avoid the long line at the base .,1
the view is definitely worth it .,1
"plus , it 's nonstop trinket sellers and tuk-tuks and taxis .",1
our hotel was about a block from the tower and so we were able to get plenty of shots of the tower at all times of day and night .,1
"it 's france 's symbol , a vision , a famous object you should see in france .",1
"the eiffel tower was an exciting experience when i visited paris , france .",1
the eiffel tower workers had a one day strike the day before to support others who were striking .,1
que c ' était belle !,1
a magnificent engineering feat .,1
"there are information plaques about the tower here , a shop , a restaurant and glass floors to see the bottom .",1
beware of groups of young turkish girls harassing tourists to sign petition - scam - they just want money .,1
firstly this is a must .,1
"during the day it is neat and interesting to look at , with all of it 's iron work .",1
it good and looks great at night when lit up .,1
paris is one of the most charming .,1
we did n't climb it -lrb- leaving that for another trip -rrb- .,1
i 'll never forget driving into paris and seeing it in the background .,1
really ruined the otherwise perfect mood .,1
due to it being a sunday we opted for a guided tour to cut the queues .,1
it 's one of the many amazing things paris is known for .,1
"and , buy a ticket to the summit , not just the second floor to avoid a line on the second floor .",1
"if you could go to only one monument in paris , it would have to be the eiffel tower .",1
this was news to me as my voucher had said we must cancel 6 days prior .,1
a spectacular engineering feat anda defiantly worth a look .,1
"the second time , i enjoyed it more as i had reflected on the last time i was there , i felt calm and stayed there longer than the last time .",1
i want to visit again and again ...,1
the colour of the iron seemed to be rusty and in need of a good spruce up ... reliant on reputation ???,1
take the time to see the waterfall at the back side of the eiffel tower and walk through the park .,1
i would definitely recommend going in the evening or in time for sunset as its quieter and the city lights look amazing .,1
"no matter if day or night , it was great to see it .",1
we visited the eiffel tower while we were there in paris .,1
this level provided us with fantastic views of the city and surrounding points of interest .,1
it 's an absolutely stunning landmark especially at night time when it was lit up !,1
almost the same walking distance from the metro station .,1
"everyone loves he eiffel tower ... but the real way to experience it is to skip the elevator , skip the lines , and take the stairs .",1
beautiful viewing platform and see whole paris in front of you from top .,1
"great photo opportunities ,",1
go till the highest i.e. 3rd level .,1
"still , the eiffel tower is must see , in my estimation .",1
i tried purchasing ~ 90 days in advance of an august trip and they were all sold out .,1
"it 's eerie , unique , and beautiful in its own creepy way at that time .",1
when we visited they had an ice skating rink on the first level .,1
i have been many time and always had to endure long lines .,1
we went there at night around 7 pm .,1
"mnogo je lepa ajfelova tura mnogo mi se svidjala ali ja sam tamo otisla i htela sam da udjem u turu ali nisam mogla zato sto je red bio predugacak i moras da rezervises tiketa ali sve ostalo je odlicno pogled , osecaj , atmosfera ja bi tamo preporucio da se ide na odmor.isto ima mesta za palacinke i pice .",1
"yes , and it is included in the ticket .",1
it 's awesome and something that can not be missed even if you have visited it many times before .,1
i went with a tour and was able to go up on the eiffel tower .,1
seemed to me they let far too many people up at any one time .,1
"you book it online or stay is longggg queues , no matter what but you will not leave this place without climbing upto all three levels .",1
"then , as i was standing there the tower lights began to twinkle .",1
"i have many images of this gorgeous , iconic landmark but my favorite by far is the one from the turn of the latest century when the an 2000 sign was lighting up the night sky .",1
at the very top we experienced views of paris in all directions .,1
you get to see one of the best sights ever .,1
the lines are crowded but in my opinion worth the wait and the views .,1
"touristy and a bit kitsch , but that 's what i love about the tower .",1
"if you want to go up in the daylight , get in line 1 hour before they open , get in the west gate line ... they open first and have great views of the city .",1
this also allows you to avoid the huge queues and join a reasonable queue : - -rrb-,1
get your reservations on line to go to the top of the eiffel tower .,1
grab a crepe and coffee and wait till it opens .,1
a perfect evening !!!,1
"so if you are going free & easy , be there early to avoid disappointment and long wait .",1
"the descent down the stairs is fun too and you get to see the lift going up and down with the ` man ' underneath the lift , as if operating it .",1
keep valuables secured - and not in your pockets .,1
"still pricey , but way worth it .",1
you might get lucky if they turn on the flashing lights .,1
"first , beware of gypsy girls and do n't fall for their survey gimmick .",1
so worth going early !,1
this is the gold standard for tourism .,1
by night it is spectacular !,1
"it was a bit scary going up in the lift as it was a windy day , and it was really windy after going up the funicular , and waiting for the lift .",1
my son was excited .,1
we enjoyed it more looking at it from outside and watching the lights twinkle at night from the cruise on the seine .,1
"an icon for paris , france and indeed for all of europe .",1
look for the new glass floor sections on the 1st level - fun .,1
the whole area has a festive feel about it .,1
"level two offers good views but take the elevator to level three for the real view , walk up a few stairs to the very top and a view of marconi 's early radio broadcasting center and tke in the breath taking view of the city",1
"by the time we went through security line , got the tickets , went to the second floor and then to the top it was about 2 hours .",1
the glass floor on the first floor is fantastic !!,1
what can one say about the eiffel tower that has n't been said before ??,1
restaurant on the first floor .,1
"although it was considerably more expensive than just buying the admission directly from the eiffel tower site , it was worth it .",1
"if you do n't want to queue for hours and do n't mind a bit of stair climbing , then i really recommend taking them , as it saved a lot of time .",1
i word a warning .,1
"if you wish to go up , book in advance , and if you wish to go all the way up , book months in advance ... but just visiting and wandering the base is fantastic , and then go climb sacre coeur if you need a view .",1
i would recommend going to the top in the lift even though you would have to wait for sometime .,1
the landmark of paris .,1
"amazing view , just enough history on display , and a café halfway up .",1
everyone who visits paris goes to the tower .,1
thank you paris .,1
we booked the tickets in advance and went directly to the west pillar with a queue reserved for only visitors with tickets .,1
go for sunset and stay to watch the sparkles at the top of the hour !,1
depending the season it may be packed of tourists but i guess it is worth visiting .,1
we had made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. and are glad we did .,1
i am told that all travel agencies corner the tickets and then sell these with a markup of 300 % to 400 % .,1
"we got there at 9am , the queue was n't that long and we got our tickets after 40min .",1
it is a short ride to the observation deck where you can get tickets and another elevator to the top .,1
i went around 8 pm and the lines were still a little crazy .,1
"on the middle level , there is a souvenir shop for those looking for one .",1
the view is great up there !,1
"i 've never been as disappointed in an attraction , as i was visiting the eiffel tower .",1
"ok , so this impressed me , pre booking allowed us to the front of all but one queue -lrb- the lift to the top -rrb- but we only waited around 15 mins .",1
the lighting is striking especially at night .,1
with the exception of the wind which was quite cold it was amazing to see paris by night .,1
bought a ticket with a tour .,1
the ticket offices need to be located separately to the security room as the queue for security was so long that it was stopping people buying tickets .,1
we then got the lift to the second level and chose to walk down from there as there was a large wait for the elevators .,1
being in paris you obviously need to go to the eiffel tower !,1
"what views , unbelievable .",1
take the stairs and you 'll feel a sense of accomplishment and achievement .,1
the view is spectacular in daylight as well as night .,1
i just ca n't believe i 've fobbed off the eiffel tower as a tourist attraction and nothing more .,1
they have a place for a glass of bubbles if you want to toast the sunset .,1
this truly is huge it is so pretty at night when it is all lit up and sparkling we never went up though just visited to see the famous tower,1
the view of paris is remarkable and unmatched from anywhere else .,1
visited paris for the 1st time several years ago and then again 2 years later .,1
we went at dusk so we got to see the sun setting over the city and watch the city light up .,1
my family and i visited the eiffel tower on a whim this week .,1
lines and crowds can be long .,1
i also felt safe walking back to my hotel at about 9:00 at night .,1
am i really here ?,1
lots of security and people selling touristy souvenirs but just ignore them all .,1
it does get a bit chilly at night so bring a warm coat or someone to snuggle next to .,1
it is a bit pricey for an elevator ride in my opinion .,1
nothing to write home about !!,1
tons of people peddling and selling nick nacks and it got annoying .,1
"bring a snack , a book and a charged mobile device , to keep you entertained !",1
"we went at night , with the lights flashing , enjoyed a bottle of wine outside and had an amazing evening .",1
we took the stairs as far as level 2 which is way more fun than the lift .,1
take a trip up to second floor .,1
your typical tourist trap - beautiful piece of history it is something that every american should visit .,1
while the queue was a bit long -lrb- about 75 minutes -rrb- the wait was offset by the fantastic view on a gorgeous day .,1
did not try to help at all .,1
people were out sitting around drinking wine and bring festive .,1
once you 're on the second floor you will have to buy additional tickets to get to the third floor .,1
"it was very busy , on the 2nd and top floor , but worth it .",1
you take the elevator to the second floor and change elevators to go to the top .,1
incredible views from the top !!,1
"looks amazing by day , but even more so at night .",1
this time we planned in advance and bought online - a little bit concerned that we could only buy tickets to level 2 but reassured when told that we could then buy an extra ticket to get up to the top from a kiosk on level 2 for about $ 6 .,1
the eiffel tower is am absolute must for any tourist who is lucky enough to find themselves in paris .,1
this is a piece of history .,1
"let me begin with seeing , there are so many beautiful places around paris but this wonder is the first thing people associate with the city .",1
i was determined to do to the top but only made it to the second level .,1
watch for pick-pockets .,1
the tour is synonymous with paris .,1
"if you can at all manage the stairs , you should !",1
"the lines were n't too bad at all , and it is n't expensive !",1
loved the one on the tallest buildings .,1
even though we were disappointed we did get lots of pictures .,1
it has been 25 years since my i last visited here and while it has to be one of the largest tourist exhibitions in the world my fiance and i decided to give it a go .,1
traffic was very backed up .,1
"you can find not bad grass lawn near the tower where you can have a picknick in a sunny day , but i would not visit it for the second time .",1
absolutely breathtaking ...,1
"you get to pause at each level , and to buy something at the cafes .",1
definitely bring a baby carrier and avoid strollers .,1
a football lovers dream .,1
she told us we could skip her talk about the sights from the second level and go directly to the top .,1
we chose not to take the elevator all the way to the top -lrb- extra charge -rrb- and were very happy with the views from level 2,1
"part of it is enclosed so on a cold or rainy night you can stay there , but there are also stairs to go up one more level where you are outside really experiencing paris in all its glory .",1
but you can still take great photos from the base and surrounding areas of the tower .,1
get in position early to beat the queues.you can be at the top viewing deck in a very short time indeed & enjoy spectacular views over paris .,1
impressive no matter what angle .,1
"even as a parisian i like to go there sometimes ... it 's magical , it 's beautiful , one can say : it 's paris !!!",1
"i think it 's all been said before , magnificent structure , beautiful at night and the views from the top are fantastic .",1
i really hate to give this 4 stars only since the structure itself is mind-blowing .,1
we decided to go up to the top .,1
"whatever they say , the eiffel tower remains the biggest tourist attraction in paris and you will definitely come there to explore it .",1
it is a recommended place if anyone is visiting france .,1
fantastic tour guide who was easy to locate .,1
i enjoy taking our friends up to the restaurant on the tower .,1
plan ahead or be prepared to pay extra for a trip to the top .,1
it is hard to imagine any tourist going to paris without spending some amount of time looking at the eiffle tower either from close up or at a distance ... .,1
make sure to see during the day but also at night .,1
few will be trying to attract you to bet on the game where you have to guess under which glass is the ball .,1
great to see in the day but even better at night when it is lit up,1
do i really need to add anything ?,1
you get to learn a lot i just say haha,1
"pack a picnic and have fun at the base but dont waste your time and money in line , not worth it !",1
the elevators run smoothly and are not too tightly packed which was a relief .,1
going to the summit is a thrill but the views are great at the 2nd level too .,1
we managed to stay up on the tower for well over 5 hours and loved every single moment of it !,1
i have been to paris many times and each time i get butterflies when i see the eiffel tower .,1
"once in a life time , so i will go to the top once in my life .",1
"we advise a visit in the night as the view from the tower is spectacular , the tower also twinkles every hour on the hour for 5 minutes , nightfall onwards , until 1 am .",1
this sight is enjoyed from the jardins du trocadero right opposite the tower .,1
it is absolutely mesmerizing and a real sight to see .,1
"it would be better to walk if you have time , no need to go by metro",1
find a good view after dark to see the lights twinkle once an hour - very special,1
well worth going to the eiffel tower at night .,1
we had a meal on the first floor in restaurant 58 .,1
standing underneath it gives you a sense of awe as you admire the efforts and archietectural work needed to build this monument .,1
after darkness on the hour extra lights on the tower are lit and it 's just beautiful .,1
"that 's a pity , as i was hoping for a bit more of both , that 's why i went on the tour !",1
must vist at night once or go in the evening and stay till night till it glitters .,1
"if you go during low peak season like winter time , there 's no need to book tix online and the queue to the lift was short .",1
we did airbnb during our stay in france .,1
stunning views of the city and the river seinne as boats pass by.angelo tomasso/chris christie .,1
"even more charming at night!take the lift to the top and enjoy the view , and then go down on the stairs to visit everything.charming !",1
"if you can , a once in lifetime xperience would be to dine at the restaurant 58 eiffel .",1
i would go there again-and again-and again !,1
we travelled from london to paris on the eurostar for a day trip to visit the eiffel tower .,1
"i visited eiffel tower on both day and night , which is a must for a full eiffel visit .",1
"we bought tickets before , so went in straight away .",1
"i am sure everyone knows paris for the eiffel tower , and says that they are not going to go there .",1
... how can you possibly go wrong ??,1
"so , i am not a lover of heights , but when your friend has a bucket list , a girls got to do what a girls got to do , and if climbing the eiffel tower is on that list , then it 's the time to combat fears .",1
the views are very good even from the second floor .,1
"my recommendation is just to go and walk around it and soak up the vibe , or get there at first opening to avoid the crowds !",1
"we knew we 'd have to see it , even though we knew how touristy it is .",1
it was drizzling a bit when we reached the base and stood in queue at the east entrance to go by lift .,1
"the embodiment of the soul of paris , ` nuff said .",1
the tour got us thru the line-up faster and up onto the tower quickly .,1
quiet a sight .,1
"watch out for the guys throwing flashing toy gliders into the air , especially if you have kids as they will try charging you if they 're picked up .",1
"its seen in all the movies , all the post card but in real life it is awesome and need to be touched .",1
a must see place in paris ...,1
we had the opportunity to climb to the second level but decided instead to walk around and buy souvenirs before heading back to the river .,1
we booked our tour through viator called skip the line tower tour by night .,1
we travelled all the way to the highest point .,1
"there are two lift/elevator , 1st climb is at the foot of the tower and 2nd climb is to the summit .",1
this was a mistake because if we had stayed in our room for 5 minutes more and checked online we could have pre booked the tickets saving 2 hrs standing in line .,1
stop -rrb- .,1
who can visit paris without doing the eiffel tower ?,1
watch out for pickpockets though .,1
it 's worth the experience of a lifetime .,1
"it is definitely recommended to get to tour de eiffel early at around 830am before queues begin , if you want to nab a spot and go up without queueing consuming 3/4s of your day in the city .",1
unfortunately it was sooo crowded -lrb- because of the summer holidays -rrb- we did n't even line up to get to the top .,1
wonderful city view from the top .,1
there is a fee for either one .,1
"the line for the elevator to the top was two hours long and , of course , there was a 5 or 7 euro charge for that ride .",1
"and in fact , given paris ' surrounding architecture , i found it as impressive as i had hoped .",1
bring a picnic .,1
also the guys with the roses are no good ... paris police should remove them if you ask me .,1
"in the evening , have a picnic along with tons of other people in the champ de mars .",1
"but the bad thing is , we waited around 2-3 hours in the line .",1
visit was awesome and our kids loved it .,1
saw in the day and at night .,1
just a little patience and you ´ ll see all the splendour of the site .,1
hopefully next time we can book diner there at night .,1
"went on a guided tour of paris , which our tickets were prepurchased .",1
"of course it is a must , however i was n't impressed by the top floor - very narrow , windy and pretty scare outside on the eiffel tower top platform floor !",1
"on the other hand , the old lifts are part of the charm .",1
"long queues even for the stairs in easter , but it is well worth it .",1
"however , i have read about it , seen movies about it since childhood so when i finally saw it , i felt great and hence the 4 stars .",1
"we entered security at the southeast end , as the line was considerably shorter than on the side closest to the seine river .",1
"she enjoyed discussing the history of the eiffel tower , the amazing views over paris and especially the architecture .",1
"i had ice cream at the bottom , champagne at the top and a macaroon in the middle .",1
high security did n't marr the experience .,1
paris is definitely the city to visit when you want to empress your significant other .,1
you can check the tickets prices on their website .,1
you have to walk to a tourist trap to pick up your tickets .,1
it was a very impressive start of a very impressive tour .,1
no pictures can give justice .,1
not sure what it 's like at night .,1
beautiful view and helpful staff !,1
"we walked right up , bought our tickets , walked right on the elevator and straight to the top .",1
it is evenly beautiful to visit in the evening as well due to the beautiful lighting on the tower during night .,1
the vistas are breathtaking .,1
i have always wanted to go to paris and finally got to when my husband took me and our baby this year .,1
the 2/3 lawns had been completely trampled and pockmarked with holes .,1
every single time when i see tour effeil i get butterfly in my stomach .,1
"while up there the crowds increased and it was a little hard to move around and get to the railing for a clear view , but still possible .",1
love the iconic eiffel tower !,1
in my opinion the best time of day to climb the tower is just about sunset .,1
"my husband and i went at christmas , and it was crowded !",1
"obviously , it will be crowded and watch out for vendors pushing souvenirs on you to buy .",1
i simply love the eiffel tower and the surrounding plaza area .,1
i recommend you to buy these tickets .,1
it 's a different kind of feeling .,1
a must do thing no matter the queues .,1
we took the stairs to level 1 & then to the bottom .,1
the lines for tickets are huge .,1
"plus wine , drinks and coffee .",1
we then queued for quite a while to purchase tickets to go to the top of the eiffle tower .,1
being just shy of 1000 ft high the eiffel tower provides great views of paris .,1
well this is another thing off our bucket list .,1
absolutely stunning experience .,1
the views really are fantastic .,1
we bypassed the que and went straight to the lift .,1
a must see when in paris !,1
"day or night , it is a beauty .",1
the one across the street by the bridge has the best deals for the money .,1
"after all these years , this tower is still in great shape .",1
the .,1
the tower is just breathtaking .,1
stay outside and get photos of it or admire the architecture .,1
also dnt miss to see eiffel tower at night,1
"highly recommended for everyone , from adults to kids .",1
just be patient and wait for the elevators .,1
this iconic symbol is photogenic from outside to within side .,1
"such an amazing experience , i thought it may be over rated but it certainly is not .",1
it was a nice view .,1
"considering walking down , for the adventure or walking up for a good work out .",1
this is not over rated .,1
"with that said , a walking trip to the tower was not wasted as they had an outdoor food market ongoing nearby .",1
"the structure is impressive and in good condition , and you get a great view across the city skyline .",1
after returning to ground level the tour itself is light up and has a dazzling lights display each hour .,1
the form they ask you to fill out requires a donation which i doubt goes anywhere near a charity .,1
we had a delicious ice cream there and the views were lovely .,1
that is the best part in my opinion .,1
i enjoyed seeing it from monsieur bleu .,1
everybody knows the eiffel tower .,1
"my wife , 2 kids and i went to the top of the eiffel tower .",1
there were also school kids .,1
i recommend a day visit and a night vist .,1
"would recommend to anyone and everyone , utterly brilliant !!",1
excellent loved it .,1
apologies if i offend anyone !,1
"however , the queues are massive !!",1
"lots of different tours , which we did not take .",1
then you take an elevator to the first level -lrb- which has shops and restaurants and then you take the elevator back down to the ground level .,1
"too late , i told him to get out of here .",1
"the eiffel tower is beautiful anytime of day or night , but my favorite is when the lights twinkle in the late evening .",1
it looked pretty amazing .,1
he did not want anything in return and was pleased to help .,1
it will save you both time and money .,1
note there is a toilet in the first floor but they were only letting one woman use it at a time -lrb- there was a queue -rrb- not sure if that is normal .,1
what a shame as paris is such a beautiful city and it was so lovely to be able to see it in it 's entirety even if it was n't pleasant being jammed in like sardines in a tin .,1
"one there , it was n't too busy and of course the views of one of the most beautiful cities in the world were breathtaking !",1
great a great view of the city !,1
place to go at evening .,1
could never have imagined what an experience this is .,1
the tower brings you a great view of paris and the tower itself is a nice building .,1
because of the time we were n't allowed to the very top but the middle bit was more than high enough for me .,1
with our tickets our entrance was through the vip gate so our wait was only 5 to 10 mins .,1
beauty at night-no wonder this is known as city of lights .,1
here are my comments :,1
tip : get tickets in advance and go at night if you can .,1
"there are 2 types of going up the tower -lrb- and 2 types of tower `` legs '' -rrb- : an elevator , or by foot .",1
it 's definitely best to book your tickets before hand as the summer season is very popular with families visiting .,1
"allow 3 hours at least - lots of queuing , to get up to level 2 and then to level 3 and then queue to get back down again .",1
"bring your sweetheart , a bottle of vino , some good bread and butter and take it all in .",1
it is magnificent at night all lit up and really special from the top where you can buy a glass of champagne !,1
it looks like a diamond broach !,1
night view is dazzling from the park beside .,1
and they 're more aggressive here than anywhere else in paris .,1
definitely will recommend buying the tickets to go to the summit about 3 months in advance .,1
you can not really come to paris though without visiting the tower,1
it was worth every penny .,1
have a bootle of wine and a pizza during the day and climb to the second level at night to see the city of lights below .,1
unfortunately we could n't go up it since pieces were falling off the day we went there so they temporarily shut it down .,1
it 's well worth a trip up the tower for the view .,1
"no matter what time of year you go to see the eiffel tower , your breath will be taken away .",1
we paid in advance and it was worth it rather than wait in those really long queues .,1
once you are in you need to queue again to get to the top .,1
line-ups are smaller and it goes faster .,1
"its worth the wait , and pricing .",1
"because the special occasion , i can see the tower having the different colors -lrb- the color from the french flag -rrb-",1
fantastic way to spend an hour with a loved one .,1
"took our niece to see the tower as she has never been to paris so the eiffel tower of course is a main attraction , it is very impressive quite large when you get up close , but the area was very crowded in august with tourist and the line to take the elevator up was very , very long ... we did walk to the arc de trompphe and along the river seine which are nice to see .",1
we walked past the tower a few times and it was amazing how short the line got at random times .,1
the eiffel tower is really one of the biggest land marks of paris and my opinion is that you need to visit it when going to paris .,1
long queues - in the heat and it was after 4pm .,1
"you will want to wear comfortable shoes and have adequate amounts of water with you if you 're going to walk all the way , or be prepared to buy drinks when you get up .",1
we were served good champagne -lrb- several glasses -rrb- .,1
lots of info on the way up .,1
an extremely popular attraction with lots of vendors and other people looking to lighten the load of euros you brought .,1
"we got luck , walking up just before 10 p.m. lots of folks were milling around , and sure enough at 10 the strobe lights started .",1
eiffel tower was of course full of tourists but the views were worth the wait .,1
the views of paris city are superb even from the second level but magnificent from the top at 1000 ft.,1
what is there to say about this engineering masterpiece that has n't already been said ?!,1
"also take into account that due to special security checks there are long queues to access , more if you do n't have tickets .",1
it stands as one of the world 's most recognisable structures .,1
"got the viator `` skip the line '' passes ahead of time for this attraction , the louvre and the 1 hour seine cruise .",1
we did not have tickets so we waited in the non-ticket holders line once inside .,1
not sure what i could write here to add to 90k reviews .,1
"the structure is amazing , great park surrounds it and of corse being paris you can not miss it .",1
finally made it inside the eiffel tower and got to check it off my bucket dream list !,1
pre book to get skip the line tickets .,1
was there with another couple and we have great time seeing the night lights on !,1
i was disappointed that a strike was going on while i was there and was not able to go up into the monument .,1
if you go early in the morning the wait is about 20 mins .,1
be prepared that it is very windy and much colder up top - beautiful views and a memorable experience .,1
had booked to go to the summit one night but due to electrical failures on a train missed my booking .,1
"the views from up top are beautiful ; however , the lineups to get up by the elevator can be bad .",1
she is visible from most points in the city .,1
"booked a combo tour which included dinner in the eiffel tower , seine river cruise and late night moulin rouge show !",1
"inspiring , beautiful , awe inspiring !",1
should n't take too long for you too !,1
there are plenty of reviews of the eiffel tower .,1
the kids loved it up and down .,1
a must visit place when you travel to paris .,1
"lots of people trying to sell you souvenirs at both places , keep alert .",1
"we enjoyed the ride to the top , and were greeted by snow !",1
in the night watching the euro cup 2016 matches at the fanzone below the eiffel tower was an ultimate experience .,1
-lrb- you do have to climb aprox .,1
i have the most enjoyable time when our office booked a river boat trip with dinner along the seine river .,1
"take the lift to the middle and then immediately take the tower to the top , then you can take your time and work your way back with less lines .",1
was great to visit and go up into but the queuing to go back down was silly !,1
we went here in combination with a seine river cruise in the evening .,1
just being on the first floor was an out-of-this-world experience .,1
the second floor offers beautiful scenic pictures but on the top floor everything looks like tiny dots .,1
we were there for few hours .,1
lives up to the hype .,1
they be better off by making more functional public toilets for the tourists at this place,1
we visited the eiffel tower as part of a day tour .,1
the stairs only ticket line was only 5 minutes long .,1
very festive and beautiful .,1
"my daughter said no , they walked off then she realised her purse was gone .",1
"with newer taller buildings coming up in other parts of the world , eiffel tower now looks small .",1
my only regret is not buying the passes in advance .,1
the eiffel tower is nothing short of spectacular .,1
excellent place to visit ... .,1
we always visit here on our trips to paris .,1
try to avoid the bridges or spending money at the river cruises which may sound romantic but you will not get the best views .,1
"we went there both during the daytime and at night time , did n't disappoint at all !",1
being the most popular tourist destination has its flaws and the biggest is the rush you endure to go to the 2nd level .,1
we paid $ 17 for a trip to the top !,1
security is tight at the moment .,1
once inside there 's seems to have been a loss of the buzz of people congregating under the central arch as a meeting place .,1
"separate female security lane , well organised , huge security presence , lots of pop up beer tents and huge screen with great atmosphere .",1
great attraction !,1
mail one to yourself : -rrb-,1
"every hour , it lasts for one minute so keep your cameras ready !!",1
"in fact , once you leave the eiffel tower , they 're gathered around the exit area waiting for people to come out and you literally have to maneuver around them since they 're grouped together .",1
"we decided to buy the lift tickets at the tower , however when we walked towards the tower , we saw people climbing up the stairs .",1
we only went to the second floor as the line was so long and i had read on tripadvisor that 2 was as good or better than 3 .,1
we even went back another night so we could see the light show .,1
be prepared to question and wait for the lifts inside .,1
we bought our tickets in advance so we skipped some of the lineups .,1
there 's nothing one can say .,1
the eiffel tower at night is a sight to behold .,1
"lots of admissions covered , plus hop on hop off bus that takes you by key sites such as the eiffel tower .",1
any visit to the french capitol must include the eiffel tower .,1
not much more to say other than its a must see .,1
i love to see effel tower in different place .,1
i took the stairs route as queue is very small and overtook 100 odd people on the way !,1
"at night or during the day , this sight is so wonderful .",1
"you can book , but we found that you could only book several weeks ahead .",1
great view wonderful experience .,1
i did n't get close enough to even pay to go up into the tower but there are lovely places around that area for amazing photos although there were alot of people around especially at this time of year -lrb- late aug -rrb- ...,1
my husband was n't so sure this was a necessary attraction to see prior to leaving but everybody who had been there insisted it was worth seeing !,1
we went at around sunset and the sight was breathtaking .,1
my hotel was on 7th arrondisement so i was within walking distance to the tower .,1
of course since the eiffel tower is only 324 m vs 828 m of the burj khalifa .,1
"we bought tickets before hand to avoid queues , which was the best thing to do as the amount of people was getting big .",1
the cheapest way we found was to climb the stairs to the second floor for $ 5 -lrb- young adult rate -rrb- and then buy the lift to the top from the second floor for $ 6 .,1
"the tower itself is impressive , maybe this will be enough for some but when you had travel around europe you soon learn that definitely there are better and more beautiful places to visit .",1
totally worth the money .,1
things are a little closer at level two and easier to distinguish .,1
"drinks are expensive , but if you catch a quiet time with a warm breeze it 's incredibly peaceful .",1
one of the symbols of paris !,1
be sure to time your visit to this iconic monument around sunset .,1
"dpending on your time zone you may have to get up in the night to set up you computer to do this , but try to get tickets to the third level of the tower .",1
"as paris is so quiet we were able to go straight up and although unfortunately the top levels were closed for work , the 1st & 2nd floors were open .",1
i visited eiffel tower on tuesday .,1
its ok for one visit and taking picture .,1
"we pre-booked our tickets for 1.30 saturday which is unfortunately 30 min after the torrential rain started , we tried to get in at 1pm but were turned away to shiver in the downpour with no kind of shelter anywhere in sight , they nearly turned us away again at 1.20 but thought better of it seeing the look on the girlfriend 's face .",1
"the restaurant on the floor below was good though , if a little overpriced .",1
i never imagined the tower was so huge .,1
the lines can be crazy at times and if you have the stamina i would recommend doing the stairs rather than wait for the elevator .,1
a sunset visit is just breathtaking !,1
we visited the eiffel tower twice during our trip .,1
"the history , `` insightful '' .",1
"go to the summit if you can , it 's small and a squeeze to get past each other , but a tick on the bucket list .",1
that it was built to last only 30 years -lrb- originally required for 6 months -rrb- makes it all the more amazing .,1
"a visit to the tower itself is not to be missed , although the meal ... could have been a little less formulaic",1
take a picture with the tower in the background for your memories .,1
"foe photography fans , go there once in day time and once in the evening will let you capture the different moods of the tower .",1
last year missed out too due to non-availability of tickets on that particular day .,1
we took the stairs for our descent .,1
best to tell them no before they place in her hands .,1
well worth a trip up to the top and do n't forget to have some champagne up there just for the fact to say that you did !,1
this required getting up in the wee hours of the morning to get the purchase made when the tickets become available within paris ' time zone .,1
also recommend to do a night trip to the top !!,1
it is a great structure and one must see it during both night and the day .,1
do watch for scammers - lots of people with clipboards asking for signatures -lrb- best advice - say `` no '' firmly and walk away ! -rrb-,1
"for example , when it rains they often close the summit and there you are not !",1
"we had loads of time to see all of the installations , and take photos -lrb- the weather cleared -rrb- would never have missed climbing up this .",1
great exercise and views are worth the climb .,1
not worth going to the top in the rain !,1
the queued was huge and after an hour we had made very little progress so we tried to book on line for later in the day but no tickets were available for 2 + months - when i say advanced booking i mean well in advance .,1
take/buy some food and lunch looking out across the city .,1
we waited in line 2 hours and got tickets for immediate entry to the top .,1
absolutely fantastic attraction .,1
by all means visit this icon of france .,1
try to do reservations for reaustarants on 1st and 2nd floor for dinner .,1
eiffel tower is one of the must see place in paris .,1
get the skip the line tour as there was long lines at the base .,1
we purchased tickets online as soon as available - that was no easy feat .,1
"tickets are n't that expensive , but i advise you not to take children in pushchairs as you have to fold them away when going in and out of lifts which is very annoying .",1
return in the evening to view and a stroll along the seine .,1
everyone should see the eiffel tower at least once in their lifetime .,1
you line up for tickets .,1
so worth it .,1
the general feeling was to get there early to have a chance against the queues -lrb- there is now one to get into the bit underneath for security and one for each pillar to get up the tower -rrb- .,1
we landed in paris in early morning .,1
"you can see 10 miles away from the 2 level , the view is amazing .",1
tripadvisor proved a reliable resource .,1
there are so many places to take great pictures of the eiffel tower around the city .,1
so happy to be able to experience this.in the evening the lights turn on the tower and at 9 they twinkle !!,1
must see attraction .,1
pack your bags and go to paris !,1
great use of time .,1
"yes it can be quite crowded but if you time your visit well , you will be fine .",1
i was happy just to observe it from the ground .,1
how you can visit paris without going there !!!,1
i have been to the eiffel tower several -lrb- maybe four ? -rrb-,1
skipped the lines went straight to the summit .,1
"i did not walk up the tower , just walk around the tower and watch and take pictures standing by the saina river .",1
was lovely place we enjoyed so much but was very cold better to visit in a warm weather !,1
we bought tickets to skip the queues which was well worth it as we passed hundreds of people queuing just to get through security then again queuing for the lifts .,1
its advisable to take the skip line option which you can buy online .,1
in january there is even a skating rink too .,1
"at 4 degrees below freezing on our visit , but with clear air and blue skies it was nevertheless memorable .",1
"the only gripe i had was with the security staff , they were rude , surly and ignorant .",1
it is more than worth it to be there at the top of the hour after dark as it sparkles at the top of the hour every hour after dark .,1
the towel 's lights are awesome .,1
went up to 2nd level and not up to the top .,1
i though paris ! '',1
we walked towards the tower but found ourselves inside a green space with a high fence between us and the tower that we did not remember from last year .,1
this is a truly great structure .,1
"impressive are the lower levels , but top is the most incredible .",1
be prepared for lines and a lot of people .,1
be careful and keep your wallet close,1
visiting the eiffel tower at night is a must,1
it was day time and all the area around eiffel tower was littered like a trash site .,1
the constant harassment from the hawkers and scammers were annoying but just walk away to a quieter area and enjoy .,1
the views are amazing !,1
"if you are going all the way to paris to see the eiffel , then go all the way !",1
"pay to go to the top - well worth it , but wear a coat if the weather is cool .",1
the ticket for the stairs is bought at a different booth and there is usually no wait whatsoever .,1
"the views are amazing , pay the extra few dollars and go all the way to the top .",1
what a delightful unique place !,1
its a great place to visit .,1
well worth paying the extra to get to the top for exceptional vies of the city .,1
"be advised , however , that if you have any sort of fear of heights that you may want to skip going to the top .",1
"yes , everyone takes a selfie at the eiffel tower .",1
we did however get a reservation for dinner .,1
it 's not true .,1
you would not regrets at all .,1
"it was night by the time we made it to the tower , which was fine by us .",1
awesome nonetheless and worth every penny or euro .,1
went to the summit before heading on our evening dinner cruise .,1
"we were there tuesday just to walk around , take pics and picnic while waiting for the twinkling lights and it was more crowded but on tuesdays the louvre and other museums are closed so maybe more people go to the tower .",1
we got lucky and made it through the ticket line quite fast .,1
"the atmosphere was buzzing and we were able to take it at our own pace , taking it all in .",1
security check at the entrance is good .,1
"not the first time i have visited the tower and what a magnificient structure it is , always swarming with tourists and hawkers selling thier punk knock off goods .",1
this was not france ; i did n't recognize this .,1
one should take some snacks and drinks and find a place with a good view of eiffel tower .,1
booked a ticket to the second level via the website .,1
very reasonable prices .,1
most people know what the eiffel tower is .,1
the view from the 2nd level is great but from the top you can see beyond paris .,1
be prepared for waiting in line all the way up to the top and all the way back to the ground and be sure to book online to at least skip the queue to buy the tickets .,1
even though it was closed there were lots of people there .,1
"for this visit we did n't climb up , but spent some times at the parks surrounding the tower at the champ de mars and at the bank of seine river.i felt that it was definitely a great structure designed and engineered by gustave eiffel .",1
the stairs are a great challenge for the young or fit and many people enjoy using the stairs .,1
"however i noticed a man cleaning the windows , he looked like a nice person .",1
there is a long wait to get inside -lrb- but that 's to be expected -rrb- .,1
wanted to walk over from trocadero -lrb- where you have a great view onto the eiffel tower -rrb- but heavy rain made us turn around and change our programme .,1
you can avoid the lines by buying advance tickets for a specific day/time entry .,1
"we got off the metro at the bir-hakeim stop and began making our way with the crowd ... then all of a sudden , as we rounded a corner , there she was , in all her magnificent glory , more huge than i ever imagined - it just took my breath and tears sprang from my eyes .",1
that was a smart move .,1
surely worth to go up there to see the beautiful landscape of paris,1
"during the first 10 minutes of every hour , the lights on the eiffel tower sparkle with blinking lights .",1
go to the top with only 17 euro ticket and feel the experience .,1
you need like 3 hours in total to enjoy the view and doing the line for the elevators withing the floors .,1
the only disadvantage is that you can not see the tower itself on the landscape while being on top of it .,1
"it does feel safe though , and it 's always well populated .",1
we could also see this from our room .,1
excellent .,1
"during the daytime , eiffel is not very charming .",1
did go over to the trocadero for a good picture .,1
the cost and hassle of going up is in my opinion unnecessary .,1
when on top take your time and enjoy the view all around .,1
simple leave you breathless .,1
what to say on tour eiffel . . . she speaks for her self you must go an visit it during a nice day to have an amazing views at the sunset to have a nice light on the ville lumière and at night to see her blinking as a jewel in the dark !,1
is n't it the most romantic place on earth ?,1
maybe my expectations were too high but seeing the eiffel tower was not as exciting as i thought it would be .,1
definitely go to the sommet and spring for the champagne at the top .,1
i elected to pay the smaller amount and climb the stairs -lrb- south pillar only -rrb- to the first and second platform .,1
"it was n't as big and tall as we imagined , and the metal structure was indeed unaesthetic compared to everything else we saw in paris .",1
loved the view from the very top platform .,1
"i 've been to the tower twice now , and it never ceases to amaze me with it beauty .",1
went there with my husband on valentine 's day eve .,1
"you can not go to paris without going up the eiffel , or at least sit on the lawn in front of it and enjoy it !",1
you can then walk and find one fo several small braseries near by .,1
once up there you can look for as long as you like the only queue is go get in the lift up but even that was n't too long a wait !,1
waiting time at the ticket counter can be very long .,1
"famous wrought iron lattice tower on the champ de mars in paris , france .",1
"we went late december , should go without saying to wrap up warm cause it is very cold !",1
"the que for the lift up was massive , so we walked up ... lovely view all the way up , not too many people on levels 1 and 2 .",1
a dream come true to be here and off my bucket list .,1
we came back for a honeymoon visit .,1
this was n't ideal as we wanted to see it with the light show so had to run down the stairs ... which is n't ideal but do-able !!,1
visited on clear day .,1
loved our time at the eiffel tower the views were amazing !,1
really ?,1
as expected there were 1 - 1.5 hours line for ticket and another 1 - 1.5 line to go up .,1
we viewed firstly in early evening from one of the vedettes du pont neuf - excellent .,1
"most spectacular sight , large in stature and easily accessible .",1
make sure you get a tour that takes you all the way up .,1
"you ca n't come to paris and not see the eiffel tower , even if it 's just from the outside .",1
reduced fee for seniors .,1
lindsay did a great job of sharing information .,1
should really going up to the top $ 17 per adult .,1
"great views of paris , better to go during off-season times , wait for the lights to be on in evening and the blinks every hour .",1
it is much grander than what you see in photos & postcards .,1
i did the elevator too at night .,1
its the symbol of the city and i understand why .,1
it 's an absolute romance in the air kind of place .,1
it was rainy and cold and windy and we had booked the tour so had to go then cause they go `` rain or shine '' .,1
our tour guide was actually an american living in paris for the last 6 years so we had no problems understanding her and she was filled with all sorts of information .,1
i 'm sure i 'll be just as awed the second and third time around .,1
"we did enjoy eiffel tower , the restaurant inside the tower altitude 95 is a must .",1
we went mid morning -lrb- early by french standards -rrb- and did not have to queue too long .,1
"the tickets , purchased on the site , allow you to take both elevators all the way to the top .",1
"place of love , you will really amazing when you will visit this place .",1
the detailed ironwork is exquisite .,1
"we got here at 830 thinking it would be a mission , it was n't you only q for 30min until it opens at 9 .",1
we had a brilliant afternoon at the eiffel tower .,1
i was delighted to spend the evening with my brother sitting in the champ de mars waiting for the lighting of the tower .,1
"we waited at least an hour to get the tickets and get in and then you must get in another line to go to the top ... it 's all a bit squishy and unpleasant ... especially carrying all our stuff from walking around that day , plus the baby , plus the stroller -lrb- which you must fold for the elevators -rrb- .",1
it 's magical .,1
i went to france during the winter ; very cloudy days .,1
neither of us are in the best shape and we do n't work out on a regular basis .,1
well worth the effort and pretty reasonable entry fee - $ 58 for the 4 of us - and we were there about 3 hours in total -lrb- 8:30 am to 11:30 am -rrb- .,1
"it was neat to see the structure from the inside , and if you 're going to visit , you should go all the way to the summit .",1
lighten up and enjoy it .,1
amazing views of paris from the top .,1
we arrived in the morning went right in and had the wonderful experience of seeing paris from this historic tower .,1
on top of all he over delivered on his promise .,1
prebooked or not .,1
definitely worth going to the very top .,1
when you think of paris you think of the eiffel tower .,1
"from below , its size , bulk and innovative ironwork are truly impressive .",1
also the night view with blinking lights each hour is mesmerizing .,1
appetizers were just ok and dessert was delicious !!!,1
"if to say truth , i never interested to see the eiffel .",1
it is so pretty at night to see the twinkling tower .,1
alway stunning to see even on a rainy day .,1
it was breathtaking and beautiful .,1
this is now when you are heading to the very top of the eiffel tower .,1
quite simply wonderful to see this amazing structure .,1
"whenever you think of paris you think of the eiffel tower , and it is as impressive as you might imagine to stand underneath , but honestly i think you get better views of paris from sacré-cœur or from the top of the arc de triomphe .",1
you should purchase a ticket online so to avoid huge queues !,1
loved the views of paris at night from the top .,1
for the more sporty you can walk part way up but of course you can also take the lifts/elevators .,1
we did not have to wait in any of the crazy long lines .,1
"though eiffel looks better in photos , its good to spend evening there .",1
i wo n't hold up 10 other people just because you are late ! '',1
not much to do but look at it .,1
the queues are often long but worth it - make sure you take the steps though ... all part of the experience !,1
i 've been to france many times and i 've been to the eiffel tower many times .,1
rode our way from the louvre to the eiffel tower as the sun set and it was beautiful .,1
the guide took us straight into the parking lot and up into the tower !,1
"however , they are all there outside the fence when you exit thru the turnstiles .",1
the no ticket line was very short .,1
all in all a real let down .,1
every hour on the hour at 9pm onwards the tower sparkles for 5 minutes .,1
the view is breathtaking and it is worth every last cent .,1
we brought the kids back and it seemed more crowded and less impressive .,1
the best view of it is as night from afar when it is lit up and quite wonderful to see .,1
"from the first level you have to pay to go up to the second , and a further charge for the third level .",1
next time come .,1
eiffel tower should be visited everyone who visit paris.because it is a wonderful place.it is very beautiful old tower .,1
it was a trip highlight !!!,1
it is everything you think it will be .,1
just say a polite `` merci '' and walk on past .,1
"on special occasions it is lit in appropriate colours , never got tired of looking at it",1
it 's recommend to get a tour to bypass lines .,1
take the elevator which is significantly costlier then walking up .,1
when we got to the second floor we got tickets to go to the top .,1
we were able to pick a day and time and then showed up about 30 minutes prior .,1
walk down !,1
it was not a pleasant experience .,1
fantastic place but it 's busy get tickets online before you travel it can save hours !!,1
it is the eiffel tour .,1
"tower , as any other location in the city is well secured , police and army are everywhere .",1
it helped that the weather gods were smiling on paris on the day .,1
"sure , it 's touristy , but where else on the planet are you going to find the tour eiffel , with the sweeping vista it provides out across the city of light ?",1
beautiful structure up close and afar .,1
make sure you visit at both day and night to get the full experience .,1
of course better to be safe than sorry but still excessive .,1
it probably took us a good three hours by the time lining up and lining up again to get to the top .,1
do bring jacket !,1
it 's something that ca n't tell everyone that been in paris at least u must taking pic yourself and the eiffel tower once in your lifetime,1
-lrb- keep your pockets empty and your bags in front of you where you can see them and your cameras around your neck .,1
my first visit to the eiffle tower was truly amazing !,1
there are already great views from here .,1
waiting time was about 20 minutes but it was worth it .,1
i have seen eiffel tower twice in a day .,1
"in summer , plan around 6:30 - 7:00 to get amazing view of the city around sunset .",1
the first time i came to paris it was the most outstanding feature of paris .,1
"well when we got there , we found that yes there were tickets and the wait was only 30 minutes .",1
we had champagne on the 2 .,1
we stood in awe walking around .,1
she is the iron lady !!,1
i have always wanted to climb to the top of the eiffel tower and finally i made it .,1
simply stunning .,1
all the bathrooms are floor to ceiling so i 'm not sure why all of them are not .,1
great view but a bit pricy to go up .,1
best to get a reservation at 6:30 for the sunset .,1
"there are a couple restaurants in the tower that , when book earlier enough , can be visited for the kick of it .",1
the elevators move fast so it does n't take long to get to the top of the tower .,1
if you want to go up in the tower you have to wait in a long queue at the base of the tower for a ticket that gets you only to the second floor .,1
queues were quite long and resulted in a half hour wait so not too bad .,1
my family traveled up into the eiffel tower with a skip the line ticket that cost me a 280 euros !,1
"at night this tower looks like a candle at , they made the lights turn around ... so amazing .",1
"the eiffel tower continues to impress , especially in belgian colours to honour the victims of the recent attacks .",1
"overall this was n't busy season though , and i think if it had been crowded the experience would have been much less enjoyable .",1
"the walk is n't really that bad/challenging and only goes up to the second deck , which seems sufficient for views -lrb- we did n't go all the way to the top -rrb- .",1
it really is beautiful seeing it all lit up at night .,1
"the tour is fairly easy with elevators to assist you to all levels , you could take the steps to levels one and two .",1
i could see the whole view of paris from all 4 directions which was excellent .,1
the complete experience is just so paris and so wonderful .,1
was breathtaking .,1
"i always thought that this was a highly over-rated attraction , till i had my first close-up view of the fully lit eiffel from the seine .",1
"well worth a visit , a must do - but choose the time you go .",1
definitely something you need to see when you 're in paris .,1
hard to believe this structure was created so far ahead of its time .,1
at the very top you feel the wind and become part of the moment .,1
"i love everything about eiffel tower , my wife was very happy especially at night when the christmas light was on display , it 's a well maintain and the security is good as there is visible police and military presence there .",1
it 's a great view and photo opportunity !,1
this was in october 2015 .,1
the tower is very pretty and impressive .,1
"saw this during the day and honestly was just ok , but at night it is truly majestic .",1
the eiffel tower itself is beautiful from a distance and up close .,1
the view from the top is incredible .,1
we then walked past the huge queue !,1
seeing the little statues just does n't prepare you for the size and complexity of the structure .,1
we then made our way to the east pillar for entry .,1
if you go at night it sparkles on the hour .,1
unfortunately they closed that level the morning of our visit but the extra fee was refunded to our credit card .,1
"it was quite nice , very crowded and lots of extemporaneous music .",1
despite the confusion i laughed it off and trekked the stairs which was quite achievable .,1
i had to have some tourists coach me to take the walk on the platforms and the experience is certainly one that should be on a bucket list .,1
tip for the day was given by one of the security guards - keep your handbag closed and all valuables close as the pick-pockets are very active in the area .,1
"also , pickpockets are everywhere .",1
she is so beautiful ... day and night .,1
"he probably never figured on his life 's work to be a tourist trap , and he probably cursing the fact that i only gave the attraction 4 out of 5 rating .",1
if you 're in paris and can visit the eiffel tower - do it !,1
during the day a tour is a must to catch the impressive history of the eiffel tower and of course the view from the top i 'm also impressive !,1
you enter elevators by timeline and whether rebooked or same day .,1
but this is an attraction you have to do once .,1
i stayed at a hotel close to the tower so it was an easy walk to see it .,1
"the river , the people , the monuments and even the ride getting there .",1
pity it was closed due to strike action !,1
i caught one with his hands in my jeans pocket .,1
"for a larger fee , you can go higher .",1
we went to the eiffel at night and it was amazing .,1
then took the lift from the second floor to the top .,1
a must see,1
"at night at 10 , 11 and 12 pm it lights up and sparkles for 5 minutes , which is neat .",1
"the eiffel tower is paris , a must see if you go and even if you do n't go up it is fun to people watch",1
"it has to be done really , does n't it ?",1
we had pre-booked tickets which is a must and would advise anyone visiting the eiffel tower to pre-book .,1
elevator to third level was not open ; no explanation .,1
and the view was amazing ... i love how they built that very artistic tower with glass in the center over looking the people in the ground .,1
usual poor traders on show near the tower itself did not help .,1
paris is a city where all visitors can breathe its history in every corner .,1
the only purpose of going all the way up is to say you did it .,1
"go at dusk , prepare to queue an hour , walk up to the first floor -lrb- first is most chilled -rrb- lie down on a bean bag , look up at the illuminated inside of the tower , inhale the ambience .",1
we booked lunch up the eiffel tower you beat the crowds and the cues really worth while and some amazing views,1
it was named after it 's designer and builder alexandre eiffel .,1
make this your number one priority on any trip to europe,1
a must to see !,1
we stayed not to far form the tower and we strolled around the the tower every night just to see it when the lights were turned on .,1
"always book in advance , of you have had it .",1
unless you really have it on your bucket list to go to the top !,1
it actually took me a while to realize how tall it was until i got there and what i thought was the top was only half way .,1
"eiffel tower is a must , not only because it is -lrb- maybe -rrb- the first thing comes in mind when you think of paris , but also because it is beautiful !",1
who would give it less ?,1
"we did n't see day time actually , but it is still really cool at night time , we love it .",1
"the reason for this is when you go up to the very top -lrb- summit -rrb- , you can recognized buildings that you already visited , so you appreciated it more !",1
"seen in so many movies , tv shows , music videos .",1
"on my way back since it was getting dark , decided to use the lifts .",1
the price for the entry is too high for what you see .,1
it was n't all too pleasant being jumped on as you walked pat but that 's kind of just something you 'll have to live with .,1
"you do n't even have to go to the top , seeing it from the ground is just as amazing .",1
"iconic , symbolic , and historical .",1
the light show happens every 4 hours and is beautiful .,1
construction being done on the grassy areas so could n't walk there but good views of the tower .,1
"stood a long time to get in , testing my patience with people who do not know how to wait their turn !",1
recommended if the weather is bright take time since lines are long .,1
winter fall best time .,1
to avoid the most people and longe queues we went here in the evening and took the elevator to 2nd floor .,1
to many people st once ... .,1
i never realised how big it is .,1
i did n't go to the top and rather just walked around the grounds and soaked it in .,1
this is paris !,1
and all attractions .,1
"nevertheless , it 's a magical sight and a `` must-see '' monument .",1
we bought tickets ahead of time and had a great time .,1
"each step is numbered , there are platforms to rest at , and there are 684 steps in total .",1
"if you can , but tickets online ahead of time , it would save some time .",1
"bring a small picnic , relax and enjoy the fabulous sight .",1
true landmark with fascinating history .,1
it was my dream that one day i shall reach the top of the eiffel tower .,1
but it was nice to get some direction beforehand and narration of the views from the 2nd level and then took the lift to the summit .,1
"our trip was dogged by rain , so by the time we had a free day that was n't wet i was tired and had already visited more exciting places in the city .",1
just when you think it could n't possibly be taller you keep going up and you get the most amazing view of the city from the top .,1
i fell in love with it .,1
"when you buy them , you need to go straight to the tower .",1
i do n't like heights but i felt very comfortable walking up the stairs .,1
this was my second visit to eiffel tower .,1
the line was daunting when we saw how long it was but it moved at a good pace and it built up the excitement .,1
within ten minutes of arriving at the tower we were standing on the second stage viewing platform .,1
that is as well a good way to see the city,1
"if you are able , walk up to the first point as your wait in line will be shorter .",1
interesting on our departure to see the ferrarris and lambourginis available for hire on the road .,1
"i have push they are hand but they still keep try , finally i am scream take away your hands from me ... then they go ... but they really not scare and shy .",1
i understand there 's only so many elevators they can have .,1
visited as part of a group tour with pariscity vision .,1
exactly what you would expect !,1
one great place to see that from my experience is the streets close to sacré-cœur / montmarte in paris .,1
the 4 star rating is only for the architectural brilliance that the tower happens to be .,1
we queued and queued and queued some more .,1
"after having visited the sacred heart basilica , i did not feel the need to take the elevator to the top .",1
"we enjoyed a romantic dinner with a room full of people.the staff was very accommodating including the security.excellent meal , breathtaking view.great value for the location !!!!!!",1
the paris fanzone for the euros was located just below the tower .,1
unfortunately this marvel is spoiled by all sorts of people selling staff on the street -lrb- not the small shops -rrb- .,1
"you go through airport style security first -lrb- although it is pretty laid back -rrb- , then line up for tickets , then line up for the elevator up .",1
"everyone was so excited , there was plenty of it falling the viewing platform had to closed down as there was lots of snow and it made it very slippery .",1
"the weather was perfect , just starting of summer or end of winter .",1
this grand beauty welcomes you with open arms and parisienne charm !,1
there was no official logo or register anywhere .,1
i visited the eiffel tower and was really thinking that the view is overrated until i witnessed it myself .,1
the eiffel tower is obviously a must for a first visit .,1
"would visit again though without a doubt , we missed the light show when it got dark so gives us an excuse to go back !!",1
"yes , it 's eiffel tower , but we stood 4 hours in line than we go to the lift .",1
"we took a lift , the trip up to the top was convenient .",1
"we went early on a beautiful sunday morning , and basically walked right on .",1
we queued for almost 2 hrs in the cold but it was worth it .,1
we were amazed by this dramatic monument .,1
the views are incredible as well .,1
we stood in line and got our tickets to go to the top - the summit .,1
"we were there at 730pm , as it started to get dark .",1
there .,1
"once the tallest building in the world , a masterpiece of engineering , a symbol of the golden era of paris -lrb- belle epoque -rrb- a place that attracted vips from all the world , today , it remains the tallest building in paris and visited by millions of tourists every year -lrb- how difficult will be the visit here you will verify first hand once you try to buy the 17euro ticket to enter and when you will attempt to use its elevators -rrb- simply `` just because it is the eiffel tower '' and nothing more .",1
excellent choice for photographs lovers !,1
"we did n't book , however we arrived on a sunday morning at 10am .",1
we then took the stairs to go down to the first floor and we were pleased to find that it was so spacious and not crowded at all .,1
lovely views of a wonderful city and if you 're lucky you get to see a proposal or two while you 're there .,1
what can you say about one of the most famous landmarks in the world ?,1
there was plenty to see on the 1st stage regarding history of the tower and free toilets which is always a bonus .,1
waiting times to go up were quite long but once on its well worth the waiting you can get food in the middle section of the tower it 's just fantastic,1
its mix up with the eternal city of paris makes it special .,1
"my coworkers and i went to a french grocery store and bought wine , baguettes , cheese , prosciutto , grapes , and a mess of other stuff , picked up a blanket and had a little picnic under the eiffel tower .",1
expected it to be crowded but the long queues are nothing compared to the beauty of this wonder .,1
"for me , it was the most underwhelming of all .",1
we probably waited for 10 mins all up so that was a huge advantage .,1
"as you would expect it is constantly busy which can be frustrating , but as long as you go with a positive attitude it will be fine .",1
"the lifts are glass and they where amazing , however if your afraid of heights this is not the place for you .",1
"you are brought to the 2nd floor , with incredible views , and can buy tickets there to the summit - definitely worth doing , even for someone like me , who 's terrified of heights !",1
say paris and think eiffel tower,1
definitely reserve a time using the website .,1
:-rrb-,1
this most recognised symbol of paris does not get old .,1
our first glimpse when we drove into paris was very exciting .,1
a must see day and night !,1
we loved our stay in paris & visiting the eiffel tower was surely one of the highlites so impressive - we went early on a saturday morning and was in the tower within an hour without prebooking or anything which is good as it get busier as the day goes on .,1
great bit of history .,1
"our favorite view is from the trocadero -lrb- which is a construction zone these days -rrb- , but just under the tower is so over run with vendors selling selfie-sticks , whirly-gigs and eiffel tower key chains , it was less than enjoyable .",1
the top is best for shooting downward and marveling at the construction .,1
wonder at its construction and grace -- day or night .,1
"i do n't know really what i envisioned , but its massiveness and intricacies of the grid work was unexpected .",1
i visited the eiffel tower on a saturday in september .,1
"if you 're visiting the tower , a ride to the top is a must do .",1
you ca n't come to paris and not see the tower .,1
if you can bear the height you should go right to the very top !,1
"we came here with a pre bought ticket to avoid the queues , on the day it was actually very quiet so we did n't need to pay extra and could have easily waited for half an hour or so to get in .",1
walk around .,1
a warning .,1
it only took an hour and we were up the eiffel tower and enjoying the magnificent views of paris .,1
"juts , wow .",1
many people wait for the lights to come on in the evening .,1
came here on a day out with my family and it was wonderful .,1
when will you ever visit paris again ?,1
"from the top , it was n't crowded so we had a chance to move around freely and take pictures .",1
tons of fun and definitely a must see .,1
ask your travel agent or check it out online .,1
the only thing weird to me was the lights turn off .,1
shame about the people trying to force sell you things but thats normal anywhere now .,1
"disliked having to either dispose or hide nearby , a penknife found on my luggage by security .",1
beautiful to see and take pictures .,1
i will just share our experience in terms of avoiding the lines .,1
but its my fault plan before you go or research more .,1
we had reservations at restaurant 58 on the first level .,1
"our visit ended up being somewhat longer than we had intended , but it was great .",1
a must see attraction in paris and quite difficult to avoid .,1
every one know tht place in whole world it is always rushy .,1
very interesting visit to the climb .,1
i can now mark this off my bucket list .,1
one of the busiest places i have been to but a great and worth all the wait !!,1
try to order in advance .,1
must come here for picnic .,1
it can get very busy which you should understand .,1
"my boyfriend and i absolutely loved the eiffel tower , we climbed the steps up to the second floor -lrb- very tiring -rrb- and got the lift to the top !",1
still great views from half way up .,1
it took longer to get even on the premises because of newer society and then even more bag check to get up the lift .,1
"no matter where you are on the tower , a sense of history surrounds you .",1
it would be best to visit other attractions first & then the eiffel tower last .,1
had a beautiful pre-booked lunch at the eiffel tower .,1
but it is still worth it going there .,1
there are lots of cafes within walking distance that serve excellent food at reasonable prices .,1
took about an hour to get the tickets and get to the top .,1
"if you are too afraid to go all the way to the top , there are different ` levels ' of viewing -- perfect for adults or children who may be afraid of heights but still want the experience .",1
it 's like dream comes true as i 've been dreaming of coming there for such a long time .,1
what a way to view in the winter time at new year !!,1
"if u do n't get online tickets for the top , book for the base level and book for the top in person .",1
"of course it was cold and windy , but we were prepared for it with all the clothes and umbrellas etc. .",1
"but really , it is not worth it , as it is better to see eiffel tower from somewhere that climb on it .",1
i m a parisian who left the country but always come to pay a visit to the tower .,1
"then , there is a separate elevator that we were able to use that brought us to the second level immediately .",1
restauratns in there are little bit overated but the tower is amazing .,1
the waiting time was slightly longer due to the security checks .,1
you feel something extraordinary there,1
"i would only appreciate the option of fast track , which was not available during our visit at the endnof october 2016",1
and they are n't just people waiting for tickets but more so people peddling wares and potential thieves .,1
"when we first caught a glimpse from our cab , i was hooked .",1
the view is amazing you see all of paris .,1
purchase tickets ahead.advance tickets significantly shorten line ups .,1
if you approach from the trocadero area which is in line with the tower and slightly elevated it 's a purfect view .,1
the hubby had done his bit by then so we went straight back down but it was the best 17 euros i have paid in a long time,1
first time in paris as a typical tourist and i knew i had to go and see it .,1
this is a must visit .,1
staff could definitely be more pro-active in preventing this happening but they seemed reluctant to get involved/help until the tower official opens .,1
guys sell wine at the base so you can enjoy watching the tower light up with your baby while enjoying some wine under the stars .,1
hopefully the security will be reduced once the state of emergency is over -lrb- if ever -rrb- .,1
awful queues even at tea time .,1
would n't miss this for anything .,1
"but , visiting the city of lights , i wish i had made that journey in the winters to enjoy long hours of lights and more shows of the twinkling eiffel .",1
"here are limited-access fenced off areas all around the tower that are very park-like , so we found a great location to relax under a tree and enjoy the view .",1
worked out that early evening whilst everyone was presumably out having tea was best .,1
we even got to see the hourly strobe lighting twice on the tour .,1
"beautiful dinner , great staff and the best view .",1
so we bought tickets on the day and went up in the lifts .,1
you can also climb the eiffel tower which i did .,1
there are several layers of x ray checks and additional security .,1
no point saying do n't bother as its one of those iconic attractions you want to say you have been to .,1
"loved it despite the hour in the queue , did not expect to spend so long up there .",1
"we had visited paris several times , but we had never before gone up the eiffel tower because of the huge crowds .",1
"wow , that says it all , my dream come true seeing paris .",1
i booked a day time slot and an evening time slot .,1
just be careful that on top it is windy ^ ^,1
i do n't like heights and i hated it but i loved that i did it .,1
literally a very good reasonably priced underground car ...,1
we walked a ways to get away from the hoard of people and had a snack before hopping on the metro .,1
sip some champagne and enjoy a macaron from the observation deck .,1
"i was really happy in the tour eiffel , was amazing that place , and i enjoyed my time there .",1
you ca n't leave paris without seeing it glitter at night !,1
when we first pulled up n our van -lrb- part of a tour -rrb- beside the water i thought the tower was much smaller than i expected .,1
you 're in paris ... what to do or rather you should be asking how much can i fit it .,1
we visited again after a late meal and it was breathtaking all lit up .,1
we were pleased to be ablre to get up there quickly as the day turned out to be really cold .,1
its very very besutiful .,1
the place is amazing you feel like you are in the heart of the universe as you can see all the nationalties around you,1
the restaurant up top is second to none .,1
we paid 5 euros each to walk to the second level .,1
the tower was not that crowded at the time we were there and the lines for those purchasing tickets on the day of was not long by any means though if you are at all able i would recommend purchasing tickets online right from the official eiffel tower website .,1
i highly recommend walking down from the first level as you get some nice views .,1
"built 127 years back in 1889 and 320 meter high with 3 levels for tourist with dining options in the top and located in the heart of the paris near seine river , eiffel tower is a rare wonder to see and cherish in the memory for the long time .",1
leaves our mind a lot to imagine .,1
finally a dream come true to visit the city of love .,1
enjoyed every minute of it .,1
be prepared for the queue or be prepared and book your tickets in advance online .,1
shorter queues for the brave doing stairs only .,1
took us about half an hour to get to the top using the lift !,1
i recommend booking in advance .,1
ca n't miss out on this if you 're in paris !!,1
"we went up just as the sun was setting , so the view was amazing !",1
a must if you are in paris .,1
i was a bit nervous at this point .,1
"i managed to go to the top , which was worth the fear .",1
there is no need to join the long queues to go up just approach from across the seine and you feel the beauty and power,1
the views from the eiffel are awesome .,1
though it gets crowded sometimes .,1
"fyi , if u r going by public transport , the rer a champ de mars tour eiffel station is closer to eiffel than the metro bir hakeim station , and u can still use the t + metro ticket if u come from somewhere else in zone 1 , like from charles de gaulle etoile -lrb- arc de triomf -rrb- ...",1
unfortunately for him my other halfs french was not quite so limited .,1
one of the places to go to in paris .,1
a guy comes to me .,1
arranged quick access through a tour company,1
"there are great views of the eiffel tower from all areas around the tower and during the evening , the tower is exceptionally beautiful as it has sparkling lights for 5 minutes each hour .",1
the ticket booth on the middle level is swamped and chaotic .,1
"one option is to buy the ticket online , at least you can save some time this way .",1
a lot more then i ever expected .,1
"when it was our time for the tour , we walked straight in .",1
my legs were pretty tired after but i really enjoyed the view .,1
this is where the view is magnificent .,1
a long wait and security checks but worth it for amazing views and just to say you were there .,1
eiffel tower was amazing !,1
i got this opportunity in august 2015 and reached paris to visit the famous eiffel tower along with my dearest wife.in the month of august there was lot of rush of tourists from different countries .,1
"i know this is a paris icon and is quite crowded , but it 's worth the wait to go to the very top .",1
the lights were beautiful and the atmosphere was one of contemplation .,1
the views are magnificent !!!,1
we paid $ 17 to see the entire paris from the eiffel tower.absolutely loved it !!!!!,1
we were lucky .,1
"as the daughter of an engineer , i expected this construction to be impressive ... but it was really very beautiful and that surprised me .",1
no trip to paris would be complete without a visit to the eiffel tower .,1
the fun and enthusiasm the boys had for viewing the tower was contagious .,1
"the view of the city was , of course , amazing .",1
"of course this is the most popular attraction in paris , so there are going to be big queues .",1
a night visit is most recommended .,1
i think all who have been in paris visited this nice attraction .,1
but there are just too many people it 's almost suffocating .,1
there was food truck with a long line but was totally worth it !,1
and the views are heavenly .,1
"for me , it was anticlimactic !",1
"so romantic , so beautiful .",1
i was very happy to not be one of the thousands of lemmings waiting in line the day of to get an elevator rodeo the top .,1
it is important that you have a timed entrance before you go to avoid very long lines .,1
"after a long walk from the seine river , we arrived at this amazing landmark .",1
lot 's of offers for tickets which sound scammy to me and long ques to go up .,1
the lines in august are hours long !!,1
"highly recommend visiting it in spite of long lines , do n't miss the top floor , go in the evening , then take the night cruise tour and view it sparkle from outside",1
i 'd advise leaving 1.5-2 hours free for actually doing the tower and however long the queue is at the time .,1
when my husband and i went it was very windy so no one was allowed to go on the top so we went on the second floor .,1
there was a long queue for the toilet which troubled everyone .,1
do n't be scared to go to the top though .,1
the best thing ever !!,1
